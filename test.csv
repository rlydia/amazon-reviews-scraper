B06Y14T5YW,a different bob,1,"The US Warranty listed is not valid. When I received my phone, I tried to register it on the Samsung website and received the error message: ""Possible reasons for the error include serial/IMEI number is not valid, product is older than 3 years, product was purchased outside the U.S.""

Contacted Amazon, and a replacement phone was sent out. When I attempted to register it, I had the same problem. After spending an hour with Samsung customer service per the number in the warranty listing, the phone does NOT have a US Warranty available."
B06Y14T5YW,Threeper,5,"BEWARE!
99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!

After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)

Pro's:
1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone.
2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8)
3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.
4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.
5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple.
6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here.
7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone.
8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.
9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.
10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.
11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone.
12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.
13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets.

Neutral:
1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions.
2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect.
3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it.
4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.
5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.
6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.

Con's:
1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness.
2. ""Ok Google"". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.
3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).
4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button.

On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know.

As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!

Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways.

Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 I was shipped had model number SM-G950F, which is the international version of the phone, not the US version as specified in this item.

I recently got lines of dead pixels in my S8 and Samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item."
B06Y14T5YW,Pete,1,"I bought this in September of 2017 and absolutely loved it. Then they pushed an update for Oreo about 6 months ago which caused the phone to no longer allow Bluetooth control of streaming services through my vehicles head unit. I waited for a fix. I looked online, and tried everything from factory resets to changing developer mode settings, updating the firmware on the head unit, contacting Pandora's tech support. Samsung's solution is for me to send it (my only active phone) in, and wait a week or two with no phone so they can send me a refurbished one... with no guarantee that it will fix the issue. Yep, I send them a phone that was purchased new, go without a phone for two weeks, and then they'll send me back a 'refurbished' phone potentially with a scratched up screen and poor battery, that will likely not fix the issue since it is clearly a software problem.
I used to swear by Samsung, but I can no longer recommend Samsung to anyone based on my S8 not working properly for 2/3 of the time I've owned it. I currently own the following Samsung devices, Galaxy S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, Gear, Gear S Nano, Samsung Refrigerator, and a Curved 4k TV. I say this so you know how much I have enjoyed Samsung in the past. If they release an update that breaks something, their expectation is that you'll just go buy a new one - I've given them 6 months to fix what they broke in the Oreo update and they haven't done it... they haven't had any trouble though pushing their new phone. No thanks. Now as items stop working I will make sure to avoid Samsung."
B06Y14T5YW,M Howard,5,"I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network. My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website. It takes just 5-10 minutes. Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6. Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy. Other than that the actual phone is great. Very sleek looking phone. This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower. If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out."
B06Y14T5YW,Pete Wingard,1,"What I like the most about the phone is that it was a unlocked phone but when I had it activated by T-mobile it work fine for a day unlimited data,talk, and texted. The second day I got a notice in notification screen that it needed a Verizon Sim card ,the phone became useless no talk no text. I reboot the phone and notice at start up a Verizon start up screen a peers. Is the phone locked or unlocked as advertised?"
B06Y14T5YW,GEMISIS,1,"Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially. Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"This review is coming from a long time Apple user. After years of drink the koolaid I decided to make a change.

Upgrading from the Apple ecosystem isn't easy as it is a big change but this phone is incredible. It may not be a 2018 flagship but it is still great.

CAMERA: the 12 megapixel camera is clear and bright. It does not take the best low light pictures but as good if not better than other flagship of 2017. In daylight this camera shines and is excellent.

SCREEN: Samsung has a always had the best quality smartphone screens. The infinity display is something to get used to but the super sampled display is no different. The colors are bright and vibrant. When the display is set to 1440p (factory defaults the display to 1080p) is crystal clear and watching videos or photos it will blow your mind if you compare it to comparable smartphones.

DESIGN: The infinity display and glad back are a very elegant design, while allowing for great features and one not so great.

FEATURES: This phone most of the features of 2018 flagships. Fingerprint scanner, face unlock and iris scanner. The only thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner is in less than a desirable location. Being right next to the camera lens it is very easy to smudge it when reaching for it, but the face unlock is very reliable and extremely fast so you have options.

Due to the glass back the s8 has wireless charging alongside Samsung's fast charging system allows for easy and fast charging anywhere.

HARDWARE: The snapdragon 835 with gigs of ram may not be the latest and greatest but for multitasking and everyday tasks are seemless. Gaming is also fast and smooth. It's no razor phone or note 9 but it is more than capable.

All in all this is great smartphone and is defintly worth your consideration if you can't stomach 1000$ for a phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Shu Chin Ma,1,"Do not buy from A)MA)ZON warehouse. I am sure this phone is great, but the one I received was missing the SIM card cover and conductor plate, and no earphone. So, sad to say, Christmas is ruined by A)MA)ZON warehouse. Wish I had this phone in actual working order. Not even sure if this review will go through, A)MA)ZON cancelled my previous review of this product."
B06Y14T5YW,Pewp Reviews,5,"I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)

This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:
-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)
-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though)
-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.
-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...)
-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)
-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)
-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks.
-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.)
-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival.

Some downsides on the phone:
-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone)
-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.
-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.
-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though.

This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.
All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.

(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)"
B06Y14T5YW,Sephirah,5,"I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.

Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure. The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's ""Infinity Display"". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)

Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month.

Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant.

Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.

Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear.

Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.

Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps.

Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other.

NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information."
B06Y14T5YW,Craig Menezes,5,"Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.

The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.

Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs.

The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.

The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.

I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!"
B06Y14T5YW,Deechaka,4,"The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+. It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates. I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5.

In the end it was worth the upgrade. As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5. I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning.

Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon. This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store.

This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""Verizon Branded"" S8. Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out. After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything.

Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all.

Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app. You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store. Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me.

Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8."
B06Y14T5YW,James G. Jaks,2,"I did buy this phone NEW and FROM Amazon just FYI
Now I know the quality of the product has nothing to do with Amazon so this rating is obviously for the product specifically.
I even noticed that someone had the same problem with the phone that I did.
It completely died after owning it for about 3 months. I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it.
However Amazons warranty is not so great. Samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on NEW items. The CSR (Customer Support Representative) was helpful and straight forward. You do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (Print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). Excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. Obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but I just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like I did. Samsung's CSR is 866-371-9501. Follow the menu prompts and you will get the option to speak to a CSR (it can get annoying waiting through all the options but you'll get there)"
B06Y14T5YW,Chad C.,4,"The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.

The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level)."
B06Y14T5YW,Shel R,5,"This is for the model SM-G950 and SOLD and FULFILLED by AMAZON.
*I bought this phone from Amazon directly, so beware of other negative reviews from other shops*
So far I love this phone. When it arrived it was clearly brand new in the box, never been touched. It also came with Samsung headphones inside the box, even though the option I selected was 'phone only'. It is lightning fast and the camera is incredible! It was an easy transition from my old Galaxy S5. I am with Tmobile and had to go get a micro-sim activated for this phone. Never had an issue in compatibility with T-Mobile and my overall service coverage actually improved. There is a minimal amount of pre-installed apps which is nice as it won't slow the phone down with unnecessary bloatware. Completely satisfied with my purchase and will update if anything changes."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"7 mounth after buying
Terrible purchase regret it will never buy a Samsung device in my life !!!!
Battery life the worst ever phone needs to be charge 3 to 4 times a day
Charging port doesn't work any more !!!
Phone has to be charged with wireless charger
Phone heats up while charging
Phone is slow since day one !!!
Use to have galaxy s 7 edge, and to be honest it feels like i downgrade to s8 just stay away Samsung's customer service are not willing to do anything but to make me send my phone without giving me any loan phone or device to use in the meantime just doesn't make sense
My suggestion Samsung learn from Apple!!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Alfred,1,"Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.
I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me ""Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back"".
So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?

I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase."
B06Y14T5YW,Honest Opinion,3,"This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one.

Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions."
B06Y14T5YW,bevin,5,"After my phone started to show it's age (about 5 years old and the battery needed to be constantly charged up during the day). The hunt for a new phone began. After reading a bunch of reviews and going on the various phone forums, I decided to go with the Samsung S8+. I had an iPhone before and hated it, so, that was not an option.
I've had the S8+ for a year now and I couldn't be any happier. The unlocked version was a better buy than getting it from my carrier because Samsung sends out updates immediately, while your carrier is a lot slower in rolling out the latest updates. One of the reasons for not getting it from my carrier is the lack of ""Bloatware"" that carriers like to add to their phones. My unlocked phone still has a very good battery life (I can go three days without charging my phone). Under heavy usage, I can go two days between charges."
B06Y14T5YW,Live From The 757,5,"Wifey's an Apple-Head ... I'm Team Samsung ... the debate continues. She recently upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus (Red Special Edition) ... & it's 'nice' ... but when I received my new Galaxy S8+, I was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality & excellence that only Samsung can deliver. It's not even close.

* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart. The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G & Any Verizon Branded Phone)'. When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete & Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit. However, my wife completed the activation steps that accompanied the SIM Card Kit (the instructions on the packaging), & the activation completed flawlessly."
B06Y14T5YW,john carrillo,1,"Very disappointed with this purchase. No US warranty!
Since I opened the box, the phone came with vertical marks on both edges. Very light marks but noticeable with the screen off.
I passed that issue, but two days ago the screen glass broke on the botton edge without any apparent reason.
I took the phone to an authorized shop to change the glass and the attendant told that it is an international version and don¡¯t have warranty in the US. Really disappointed with this phone.
Don¡¯t know how Amazon let this type of products are sold in this site."
B06Y14T5YW,Karen Pappalardo,1,"In less than 8 months, the call volume on this phone no longer works. After numerous hours on the phone and at an authorized service center, it was determined that it is a manufacturers defect. Customer support from Samsung was not helpful. I have to send the phone back to Samsung to be repaired; and although the phone is under warranty Samsung support refused to provide a loaner and told me I have to wait 2 weeks for the phone to be repaired."
B06Y14T5YW,zhou,1,"Read my review before make your decision!!!!!!!!!
I have purchased the S8 from this seller for around 5 months only. I have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. Then when I was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: Device Storage Corrupted.
Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this?

If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,J. Holder,5,"This phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened. The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!"
B06Y14T5YW,Thauan Reis,5,"It's a Samsung so I live it. I got this to replace my S7 that was terrible,and battery life as super low.
I was thinking about getting the S9 with Sprint,but their prices are insane and the S9 has not much difference from the S8 other the finger print scanner button, new processor and new camera. It is not worth the price and the monthly payment to the carrier. I decided to get a unlocked S8 and not own them a penny what's great. It works with Sprint just fine, I highly recommend you to buy your own phone than deal with these carrier financing scam."
B06Y14T5YW,writergirl87,5,"I love the look and functionality of this phone. It's got plenty of internal storage and a slot for my memory chip. I'm not thrilled with the charging port, all my micro USB chargers are now useless, and the battery life is not amazing. My old phone, a cheap Samsung J3, had a 12 hour battery life. Usually, far longer. Even so, I love this phone and it did come with an attachment to convert one of my micro USB car chargers into a compatible charger, so... Ultimately, a great purchase. I'll just have to charge it on long work days."
B06Y14T5YW,Arcane Radio,5,"At first I was thinking ""Am I nuts for spending 600 bucks on a phone?"" Well sanity not withstanding, I am happy with my new phone.
I use it with my Tracfone account. So it is cheap for me to maintain for the year. It's nice not having a phone that is locked to any specific carrier.
And the functionality of the S8 is great. I like the biometric features. The DEX functionality is a bonus. I didn't even know about it at the time I bought it. The built in device maintenance means I don't have to run an app that bombards me with ads just to clean the phones OS.

The bad.
Samsung Bixby. I don't have a problem with everyone trying to come up with their own digital assistant software. But it should be optional not forced. In order to disable it on the phone, first you have to agree with the license. Not happy about having to agree to let someone in my house in order to be able to tell them to get out.
Samsung Pay. No you cannot hold my wallet.
Samsung Health. Stop shoving advertising in my face.

But other than that, I love the phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Bryan Scott Pickens,1,"This is a Samsung phone. It came with AT&T instruction book.
The description stated it was a US unlocked phone and it is not.
The phone came and the default language was Dutch. Had to use google to translate so I could get it set.
The phone will only only use 3g and 2G. 4G is not available.

Do not purchase this phone if you are expecting a US version. Amazon should prevent fraudulent vendors like this from selling on their site."
B06Y14T5YW,Sherael K,5,This is one of the coolest cells ever. I had no problem activating. I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating. First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it.
B06Y14T5YW,Robert C,3,"I read the reviews and I needed a waterproof phone. I've only had this for a few days so far and still getting used to why it makes noises at different times. It told me ""it appears you go to bed around 0030, do you want to enter in plans for tomorrow now?"" or something to that effect at 6pm today. That is a little creepy to me. These are supposed to be phones, communication devices not creeper tracking you.

I truly believe the prices for these ""smartphones"" are between insane and stupid (over $500 for this one and IPHONES run close enough to $1000), but times are a changing and we all ""need"" to stay connected with these little devices.

The camera works really well on this phone as it takes nice, sharp photos. It was a bit of a challenge to transfer my contacts from a non Samsung phone to this one. Just export your contacts to a micro SD card from your old phone and put in the new S8. It only took a short time to bring all the info over to the new phone."
B06Y14T5YW,C. King,2,"I've had it for a few months now and while I've gotten used to it, I can honestly say I don't like this phone.
I'm always triggering Bixby, which is annoying in itself, but add to it that it's a fairly useless feature and it becomes a lot worse.
I'm not overly impressed by the camera, I came from a Note 4 so I expected to be blown away.
Accessing camera settings is a pain and it seems there are fewer manual options than with the Note 4 in terms of camera functionality - or maybe I just haven't figured it out yet, but even if that's the case, it's annoying.
After the transfer, about a week in, a bunch of my pictures and contacts were gone and it seems the Cloud had specifically ""chosen"" not to back those up as well.
Occasionally the Maps vocal function doesn't work, I have yet to figure out why.
The Fingerprint function should be located better.
Now learning that Droids were targeted with the most privacy issues... I don't know, I've been a pretty advid Droid fan, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one and I might turn away from the brand entirety."
B06Y14T5YW,Scott Lee W.,5,"After 10 years with Apple, bye bye Apple I'm done. After holding this phone you realize Apple had stopped innovating. This is by far the most beautiful, sleek fluid thin light weight designed phone ever to be offered. The infinity screen is stunning to the human eyes, the speed of the processor is just amazing."
B06Y14T5YW,Leah Michelle,4,"There is a lot I love about this phone but a handful of things I'm not crazy about. Picture quality, sound quality, storage, all of those are great. The Bixby button sucks. The location of the button is TERRIBLE and I'm constantly hitting it on accident and having Bixby take over my screen. I dont use Bixby, I can't figure out how to turn the option off (of that's even possible). Another thing I dont care for is how easy it is to move apps and folders around on the screen. It seems like at least once a week I look at my phone and some apps/folders are in a different place I have no idea when it happened. Lastly, I switched to this phone from an iPhone 5, and it seems like my cell service (which didnt change) is WAY worse. Lots of calls going straight to voicemail without my phone ever ringing. I never had that issue on iPhone. Overall I'm very pleased. The battery life is amazing (kicks the iPhone's booty for sure), memory space is amazing (again, kicking booty). I wouldnt go back"
B06Y14T5YW,Rajesh Mahapatra,1,"This product is not US version nor having any US warranty. Also model number mentioned is different than mentioned in phone settings. Amazon should blacklist this type of sellers. (VIPOUTLET). If this is mistake by Amazon, Amazon should be sued for manipulation. When i tried to register this phone, i got following message:
""Possible reasons for the error include serial/IMEI number is not valid, product is older than 3 years, product was purchased outside the U.S."""
B06Y14T5YW,Paul Alulema,1,"I bought two cellphones, my wife cellphone is still working great. But my cellphone had a software problem since the beginning, everytime I tried to update the software it showed an error. Last week I installed Samsung Smart Switch on my PC to back up my files, it showed me the option that I could update the software through this app, but after a while it just took me to a blue screen, now my cellphone is useless, it doesnt accept the emergency software recovery or any other option. I will try to get the warranty."
B06Y14T5YW,Pierre H.,5,"After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.

Pros:
-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size.
-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp.
-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive
-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger
-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution.

Cons:
-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case)
-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case)
-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.

Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!"
B06Y14T5YW,Saddle Sore,1,"Was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, Verizon. Well, it wasn't. Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon. So Frustrating! It's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case Verizon), and buy the phone there. Whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. Ugh!"
B06Y14T5YW,Aerin O.,5,"This Samsung device receives 9.5 from me. I have had an issue with almost every apple iPhone, mostly because of their weak cell receptions. I was always frustrated with call quality and apps crashing. Also with the last IPhone 6S I had owned the battery would always drain once down to around 25%. This S8+ does not have any of those problems and is phenomenal in performance. There is no slowdown switching from apps, video and call quality are top notch. Color calibration to app resolution, video games to Microsoft apps, whatever you throw at it, it does without difficulty. Call quality, audio and cell reception quite excellent. I have T Mobile service and was worrying that the speed would drop from LTE down to 4G or 3. Not once does it drop from LTE speeds. I know many people complain about the 16:9 ratio. This doesn't bother me. If you want to use pictures for desktop, just adjust the ratio in Camera app. Almost every app is now fitted for the screen ratio and when streaming videos, you can double tap the screen to zoom to fit. This feature makes the video streaming very very enjoyable. The only complain I have is with the AKG ear phones the phone comes with. Ear buds do not have a good bass. I ended up using the Samsung ear buds instead. Factory Unlocked version is definitely worth the price because there are no Carrier bloatware on it. Yes! No more Bloatware."
B06Y14T5YW,Caleb,5,"I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. Honestly, I know I am bias towards Samsung products but everything I have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. They made great phones and appliances. Everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth."
B06Y14T5YW,Chris B.,5,"This phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. Some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but I dont really mind, I got used to it in a day but thats just me. This is one of the best phones I've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!

One thing I would like to point out, wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service, so this is what I did, grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8, it worked for me.

Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.

Edit: I added some pictures of what I did with the VPN, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your S8, hope this helps.
Ps.My friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case."
B06Y14T5YW,JGM,4,"I was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old Note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. Battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps ""sleeping"". It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""OK Google"".

On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan."
B06Y14T5YW,Richard Bowers,1,"Great phone! Good touchscreen response. Great camera, ect, etc. Would have been perfect if they had packaged the right one. I don't live in freaking Europe. Samsung fail, not Amazon. The box listed the model as SM-G950U1 (USA version). Inside, factory sealed, was SM-G950F (international version). The IMEI number even matched. How could this error possibly happen?!? It cost me half a day dealing with Verizon trying to figure out what the problem was.
Pissed"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"Im very disappointed with my purchase, i purchase this phone in August and the phone no longer turns on as of November 27 this year."
B06Y14T5YW,Modern Xena,5,"Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly.

My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.

My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now."
B06Y14T5YW,Greg Thompson,5,"I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper.
So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward. I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone.
I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box.
All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!"
B06Y14T5YW,Kindle Customer,5,"This is quite a phone.
It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4.
It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card. (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.)
If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone. The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already.
One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone. You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps. Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.
I can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (I use Firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date."
B06Y14T5YW,nphoton,5,"I really like this phone, upgraded from a comparatively ancient Note 2 and got it last week. The battery life lasts me a bit under two days using it normally with the ""always on"" screen feature, but there are some fancy-looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone's functionality for significantly longer battery life. I haven't tested them yet though because it hasn't been necessary. I'm sad to see the S Pen go, it wasn't worth spending another $350 for the Note 8, but I'm impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels. The camera is also pretty reasonable. Low-light situations are pretty questionable, but for a phone it seems to do a decent job. The camera fares much better in bright indoor lights and outside.

The S8 feels pretty light and a bit slick due to how much glass is used in its construction. It's a nice-looking phone, but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years, I took zero chances and put it in an Otterbox Defender case almost immediately.

The software is also quite nice. There's no carrier bloatware on it so you don't have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you'll never use, but it still comes with most of the basic apps you'll need. Samsung clearly put in a lot of effort on the overall aesthetics of the interface too. Overall no complaints.

My carrier is Verizon and it was relatively painless to get the phone set up with them. I just went to one of their locations (not a third-party retailer) and they gave me a SIM card for free. I was alone during this so they texted a code to my parents and I called them via a landline phone at the store so they could read it me, and after punching that into the terminal the Verizon employee took care of the rest. I recommend using Google or Verizon's cloud backup or some other software (like Samsung Kies) to get your contacts BEFORE getting the new phone. I forgot to do that so I walked around for two days getting texts from disembodied numbers until I worked it out on my own. Set up backups NOW, my old phone's screen was completely broken (hence the new phone) and the only reason I was able to get my contacts off of it was because the S Pen digitizer was still functioning (but nothing else) so I could blindly punch in my PIN to unlock the phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Jay F.,4,"Great phone, first unlocked we've ever bought, and it was a great move. It's great but not perfect.

PROS
Excellent performance with all apps, very snappy
Beautiful screen (though very delicate)
Light, great battery life

CONS
* Phone is slippery wherever you touch/grab it. Hard to hold onto, unless you get a case, which you probably should.
* Bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left, which you will be mistakenly hitting often (you can sign into Samsung and set the button to do nothing, but you can't seem to reassign the button to be useful, or completely get rid of Bixby).
* Edge screen design is a novelty and more difficult to use than a standard screen. I find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger, because of the wrapping edges of the screen
* Doesn't seem to have a widget for flashlight built in, like my S5 had"
B06Y14T5YW,Greggg,5,"PROS:
Great phone in almost all regards. My last one was a Samsung S5. This is noticeably faster to respond, and battery life is improved. It uses a USB-C connector, which I guess is the new standard, so I'm replacing all my cables. (Samsung's package includes a short USB-C cable and charger, plus a Micro-USB to USB-C adapter.)
Nice display. This is the standard S8, not the S8 Plus, but this one is plenty big. WARNING: It's all glass, so I strongly recommend buying a protective case. I did.
Nice camera.
CONS:
Battery cannot be opened nor removed.
Phone does not have ""Wi-Fi Calling"" (voice over Wifi) feature. Most phones have had that for years, including my old Samsung S5. It may be up to the carrier to turn on that feature, and this phone came ""unlocked"" with no carrier. I've contacted a couple people at AT&T but they say ""it's just not on this phone,"" and of course they cannot fix the missing feature."
B06Y14T5YW,Brian V,3,"I have had this phone for several months now.

This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging.
With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P.

1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android.
2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed.
3. Single bottom firing speaker.

With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again.
The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try.
The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone. The speaker is loud, but stereo audio sounds much better."
B06Y14T5YW,Martin J Walton,5,"An all around good phone, with a fast, clean, and well thought out user interface. A literal life saver, as it ""secret serviced"" a .45 hollow point meant for my femur...

I'll elaborate.

While I was at the shooting range there was a negligent discharge and the round impacted my left thigh. Fortunately, I kept my Galaxy S8 in my front left pocket, and it took the round for me. The bullet went trough the case smashed the back of the phone dented and deformed some metal plate in the phone and then deflected out of the back of the case and came to rest in the bottom of my pants pocket.

I'd post pictures but, well, the S8 didn't make it. I've been using Samsung phones for a few years now with no issues, and now that one has saved my life (probably) I am likely to keep using them."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,Verizon could not activate phone because it is not USA version. I took all precautions by purchasing phone case and screen protector. Placed protector and all on phone out of box. Now I have to return all. just a waste of my time and money. Now why sell a phone in the USA if it's for United Arab!!! This is a scam. Buyer Beware!!
B06Y14T5YW,Homer,5,"This camera has been reviewed about 18,000,000 times. If you're looking for some incredible insight or new understanding of how the Samsung SA plus works, there are lots of phone reviews that will give you the incredibly detailed evaluation

I got this as a replacement phone for a significant other. That person has one basic need. To send messages, to make calls, and to get a camera that can take good pictures. I have the exact same phone but I have the note 8. I think the note 8 is the absolute best phone I've ever had. I use the pen for taking notes and making quick reminders. I also use the pen to edit the pictures and I have multiple photo editing programs. They require a fine touch and my fat fingers don't work.

If you don't need the pen, this is the same phone and does everything but does not have this slightly added size and slightly diminished battery that the note 8 has. Apparently when they add the stylus they take a little bit away from the battery and add a little bit to the size and weight of the phone.

Android on this phone works great. Yes it comes with tons of bloatware but it can be left alone or removed. Bixby is a absolute pain and the Bixby button is nothing but an annoyance. I downloaded an app that allowed it to be reprogrammed. Unfortunately, Samsung keeps updating the phone and seems to have an ulterior motive to remove the option of reprogramming the Bixby button. Fortunately, app developers are only one step behind and update the app the minute that Samsung seems to interfere with the app function.

In the last year I've used this type of phone it has a great screen, great processor, incredible touch, and the O LED screen is awesome.

I read a lot of reviews of people who broke their phone or commented that the touchscreen was diminished after they put a screen protector on. I've use this phone for a year without a screen protector. I understand the anger and hostility of people who broken their screen on a very expensive phone shortly after purchase. Unfortunately, accidents happen and any phone can have a screen that breaks due to either clumsiness or inadvertent shock.

And, putting a glass screen protector on the phone will diminish the touchscreen capability. I have not used a screen protector any year, carry it in my pocket and have zero scratches. Take off your protector and enjoy the beauty of the phone

In my experience, this phone is five stars. Great GPS, great Google voice recognition, great screen, processor works and seems to be able to handle everything you throw at it."
B06Y14T5YW,Paul R. Steel,5,"Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth.
I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature.
Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down.
Iris recognition, cumbersome. But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps.
Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones. Nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!
Way way better than my S5.
Like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! So don't even Try to steal it!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,"This is a good phone with some major issues.
First good:
--Very nice display and good sound
--Good camera, especially in low light.
--Looks really good.

Now to the bad:
--Some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time I want to use Amazon Prime Video.
--Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly.
--It may be T-Mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so I had to create my own setting for it
-- The biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at ""Samsung 837"" are great. If anyone lives in NYC Metro area, you should visit Samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain)."
B06Y14T5YW,Bob Doran,3,"I have had my S8 purchased directly here through Amazon for exactly one year last week. It has been great except for one big problem. About two months ago I saw a moisture warning stating ""Check USB/Charger Port: Moisture has been detected in your charger/USB port. Make sure it's dry before charging your phone. It may take some time to dry completely"". Initially the warning went away, but then it came back about a week later and has stayed lingering on my swipe screen and notifications area ever since. No amount of drying or cleaning the USB port fixes it. It wont let me charge the phone with the USB cable. There is a work-around, I can restart the phone and plug it in just as the restart screen appears, but this is a huge PITA, especially if I am using the phone for GPS and driving. So while I love all other aspects of the phone, this defective USB moisture sensor is ruining an otherwise excellent product. I have even tried putting it in my laboratory desiccator in case there was any trapped moisture, but not effect."
B06Y14T5YW,Chris Schick,2,"I was a Apple User for the longest time and i decided to try a Samsung product. I loved the phone, I thought the phone functioned a lot better then any IPhone i had. After about a month of no issues at all, the phone just stopped working. I never dropped the phone or anything, just out of the blue it stopped working. I went and bought 4 different charges (about $100 in chargers) to find out none of the chargers worked to turn the phone on. Luckily, Samsung was very upfront about solving the issue with my phone. Since i bought the phone only a month ago, the phone does have a warranty. I haven't received my new phone yet so still to be determined how they handle the warranty. Assuming they send another one and everything is smooth then ill be a customer again in the future.

Overall good phone, just make sure to take care of it assuming it breaks on you. Just to make sure they honor the warranty."
B06Y14T5YW,ernest,2,"I purchased my phone mid 2017 . Had fast shipping and product looked to be legit . No issues for the 6-8 months , Until the keyboard started to burn into the screen. This can not be a factory screen as everyone I know with store bought phones have not had this issue. I was very hesitant to order off amazon but figured why not . Well this is why not.

BUY FROM AN AUTHORIZED DEALER!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,nathan,5,"I went from a bootloop ridden LG-g4 to a cheap $50~ phone with a cracked screen/bad mic/speaker for almost 2 years, it didn't really bother me much until I started working and going to college, that's when I started getting lots of calls. So my cheap ass finally decided to get a new phone. After some research, the s8 was the only thing in the 450-500 price range that was was this amazing so I bought it as soon as it was in stock. And I do not regret it for a single moment of the day. This phone has mostly everything I didn't have on my old phone, an amazing screen, water resistant, faster processor, great software, and a good camera. Most of the apps Samsung has are actually useful or at least decent, too bad my cell company forced me to install a bunch of bad apps. The only con I have for this phone is that it doesn't have a ridiculously long battery life compared to my cheap phone, but the tradeoff is the screen/process power of course. Anyways, great phone for the price I guarantee you won't regret it."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues"
B06Y14T5YW,TexasHobbist,4,"I already have an S8 for personal phone so purchased a second one for my Work phone. This one came with T-Mobile branded but just like my other one it changed to Verizon as soon as I put in the SIM. I have had my personal phone almost 2 years and by far the best device I have every used. Battery life on it is amazing and of course I tweaked and removed many apps I will never use to help.

This phone is just as awesome except the battery life. After all day light use I am down to 25% with Mid-Level power savings implemented where as my other main phone is still 65% - 70% if no power savings profile. If I used it heavily I need to recharge at least once. I have tweaked and changed everything but after doing my experiments there is definitely something different. Either I just have and exceptional battery in my 2 year old phone or the new one has some short comings.

I am going to continue with the phone but I am guessing I will need to get the battery replaced sooner than I was expecting. Love everything else but that is very disappointing."
B06Y14T5YW,S. Miller,1,Ive loved all my samsung phones EXCEPT THIS ONE. It freezes up (software issue) and gets super hot. SO EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE GLASS.. its becaus they can charge alot. iphone was $80.. my s8 over $300!!
B06Y14T5YW,Rick,2,"The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone. It may or may not have been ""unlocked by Samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone. Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types. When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a Verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray. You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone. I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung. It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it. For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising.

1/11/2018 - Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today. It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined. Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from ""Electronic Deals"" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store."
B06Y14T5YW,Love to Cycle,5,"Thanks to all who took their time in writing reviews on how to save money by purchasing an unlocked phone outside of our cell phone plan vendors. THANK YOU! The phone was easily added to my existing Verizon account saving $300 on the purchase price without paying a ""$50 activation fee"". I actually took the phone to a Verizon store and a very nice Verizon employee did all the work, including adding a screen saver and Otter box. Hated my 7, which failed from day one. I love the 8 and loved losing all the Verizon apps I never asked for or needed."
B06Y14T5YW,Johnny B.,4,"the S8 Plus is very nice. The screen is great and the phone is fast, responsive and well designed. a decent wired headset and fast charger is included. i am getting good battery life. my only complaint is the apps that come with the phone and can¡¯t be uninstalled. this is especially true of the bixby app which i don¡¯t use. it has a dedicated button which i disabled. the voice dictation doesn¡¯t work as well as the Google dictation. fortunately it can be changed to use Google by default."
B06Y14T5YW,Elle,5,"Why didn't anyone tell me about the Samsung galaxy life! I....cuss word....LOVE this phone. Love love love! It is so sleek and beautiful and smooth. The texting ease. The apps. I hardly know what to do with myself, I am overwhelmed by awesomeness. Listen to me. If you're like me and keep things in your cart for days and weeks at a time because of indeciveness, please believe me....this will be the one thing that is worth the fast click purchase. I'm so sorry I didn't get it sooner but I will never look back. #Samsung fer life!"
B06Y14T5YW,TMad,2,"It is a nice phone and works well. I have been using it for about 4 months and have not had any problems with how fast the phone operates or any software glitches that are game breaking. However, I do not use the bixby button and it is annoying since my old phone's unlock button is now where that button is located. Also, when utilizing the phone and accidentally touching the curved edges you get little popups in the corners that are also really annoying. And lastly the curved edges make it extremely hard to protect the phone's screen. This is due to not having a phone case that protects those edges of the phone. I much prefer a flat screen. I did not think this would be a huge deal breaker when I purchased the phone but after dropping it twice, with a case on it, I have received two cracks in the screen. One crack for each drop. I will probably end up replacing the screen and trying to make due with the issue, but I am not happy with samsung over this phone and looking a bit harder in the future at other phone manufacturers."
B06Y14T5YW,Dieter J. Fellner,1,"Today my Samsung S8 died. Fine one minute, completely dead the next. I switched out from iPhone and when it worked, I loved it. Tried all the available salvage options, but no use, it's completely unresponsive no matter what. 13 months of use - seems like a heavy price tag. Hence the 1 star rating. Samsung , please get your act together."
B06Y14T5YW,AnikaG,5,"I was looking for a new Android phone and it came down to this or the Pixel 2. The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably.

It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. I bought a super thin Humixx case (red!) that I like, and no problems."
B06Y14T5YW,Matthew,5,"The S8 is a great phone. I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and I was worried it would be annoying to get activated on her Verizon account. I was completely wrong: she took her sim card out of her iphone 6, put it in her new S8, let the phone finish its initial setup, and that was literally it. She didn't have to even log into her Verizon account and register anything, it just worked immediately (i.e. she could send texts and calls and use her 4g network when wifi was turned off). Very impressive.

Pros:
- instant setup without any hassle or contacting Verizon. Didn't need to contact or even login to Verizon (already had a sim card from another Verizon phone)
- Fast, great screen, Android, great camera, expandable disk space, slim, gorgeous
- Powerful enough to emulate ps1 games
- Still has a dedicated headphone jack

Cons:
- dedicated Bixby (virtual assistant that I don't care to learn) button that can only be disabled not reprogrammed
- inserting sim and sd card works via a flimsy insert that pops out the top. Fortunately you only likely have to do this once or twice"
B06Y14T5YW,Jay,4,"Overall it a great phone. But you don't see any performance improvement compared to Snapdragon 820 processor based phones.
Always check the seller before placing the order.
Pros:
Sleek, beautiful phone.
Great camera, screen, battery life and call quality.
Cons:
I am not getting any notification in my fitbit charge 2 even after enabling all available permission for the app / phone factory reset. I think samsung want to promote their Wearables. I can give 5 stars if samsung fix this issue.
Full glass body. Handle carefully.
Lot of bloatwares with the phone. But you can disable the apps.
Awkward position of fingerprint reader."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"I read the good, the bad, the ugly reviews and took my chances. 2-day shipping, little scratches on the box but at least the phone was in there. I activated the new T-Mobile sim card with my existing account and all my data from my old galaxy phone got transferred smoothly. The phone has a great sleek modern look and feel, no problems with it."
B06Y14T5YW,Thomas,4,"The phone functions quite well and it's performance is nice compared to older phones I've used in the past. Still, the Bixby feature is annoying and the edge screen makes it hard to type. The screen is also hard to protect because many tempered glass screen protectors don't adhere correctly to it. To make matters worse, the Spigen case I bought doesn't seem to provide enough front facing protection. If i drop this thing on its face, its done.

Battery is acceptable and it runs most apps fairly quickly. I'm not too impressed with the camera, though it is an improvement over my Nexus 6p.

While I'm satisfied with it's performance, I'm a bit annoyed that such a best selling phone gets Android updates quite late. It's not bad but far from breathtaking."
B06Y14T5YW,chalkmtn,4,"Arrived quickly, took to ATT for activation with absolutely no problem. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes including adding changes to my account. Phone is a nice size, display very clear. My only con is that the font sizes are not great and don't allow too much adjustment. With a bigger screen, this is harder to read texts on than my Galaxy 5. I will play with the screen zoom and fonts, may see if I can download one that works better for me. Overall it's very nice, and a definite upgrade. Glad I stayed with Galaxy."
B06Y14T5YW,Oracledba,5,"This phone is clearly new and IS unlocked.
Seller shipped unit right away.
the factory box had a nice presentation with phone all the cables/fobs/cords present.
I have been using this phone for 3 days now and it is working out perfect.

To ge my phone on Straight Talk I went to their website and chatted with the rep.
They sent me a sim card called: ""Verizon Compatible"" Product Id ""TF256PSIMV9TD""..
When it arrived I chatted with rep again -but probably didn't need to do so -.
They had me use their website and fill out the activation panels.
Basically giving the system the phones MEID the sim's serial and the money for 1 month service.

With that task done, I inserted Sim card into phone and booted it up.
I was making calls, and sending texts (both sms and mms) without any issues or hassle."
B06Y14T5YW,Andrew Lam,3,"While the phone itself runs smoothly and isn't drowned in bloatware, looks aesthetic, and is packed with one of the best cell phone cameras I have ever handled, it only took a slide off my bed in order to crack the screen. Unfortunately, the screen on this phone just croaked, rendering it useless, and getting a replacement display will not be cheap.

Another thing to note was that the end curvature of the display could be a nuisance, as my hand would wrap around the phone and inadvertently activate the side panel among other things."
B06Y14T5YW,Monica Rose,5,"SO I ordered the Samsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64GB-US model G950U midnight black US warranty. Used in good conditions retailed for $519.00 plus tax . It shipped Amazon prime and it arrived via Fedex. Presentation and packaging was nice I expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box. So when I turned on the phone I was worried because it had a Verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read "" not a verizon sim card"" anyways so I went to Metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked I said yes, the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up. I got home and checked my main features I use like, casting to tv, wifi, browser & youtube sharing, messaging, messaging sharing, bluetooth, wireless charging, sharing, phone calls, google chrome, google home everything worked perfectly so maybe its just the feautures offered from the Verizon network."
B06Y14T5YW,Mara,5,I was skeptic about buying this because I wasn't sure it would work with my phone plan (Ihave boost mobile). Plus the phone was used and I was worried about what condition it would actually be in once I've gotten it. Once I received the phone it looked brand new not 1 scratch on it. Boost couldn't activate it though so I became a little discouraged. The girl that worked at boost told me I could go to sprint and they would help me for a fee. I went to sprint to get the sims card that boost does not carry on hand. They would have had to order it. So I went to sprint gave them the info on the sim card I needed. They were able to help me and the sims card ended up being free. Setup was easy after that. I just needed to put my info into the phone and less then 5 minutes it was up and running. I love that the phone came with a warranty. I purchased the phone October 2018 and I called samsung to find out how much longer the warranty was good for. They told me August of next year. I do have two cons about my purchase #1 being it doesn't come with a charger and #2 it doesn't come with the fancy headphones that the s8 comes with. Overall I'm please with my purchase.
B06Y14T5YW,Br David Chris Klecker,5,"I will simply add to the ""I love it"" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome."
B06Y14T5YW,Rina Savage,5,"I got tired of being forcibly throttled by iOS. I had an iPhone 7 and like my iPad Air 2 both seem to be running slower and slower regardless of actions taken to remedy.

I decided to go back to Android.

This S8+ COULD redeem Android for me as prior Android phones were slow, laggy, and poor performers that proved unreliable. This phone is fast, works smooth with minimal issue and most importantly, is reliable. Unfortunately some of the little, insignificant things have not been resolved but functionality is much higher than with my iPhone 7.

Of course, it is still early on, if I have any issues, I will update my review as usual."
B06Y14T5YW,Bre McGill,4,"I've had a Samsungs since high school. It is just easier to use and I know how they work. I like the slickness, the volume, and the picture quality. I am a simple person and I don't generally find out everything that my new technology does but the Samsung has prompted me to do just about everything it could possibly do. Also, it being unlocked worked out. I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT&T and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! As opposed to UPs or FEDEX they don't bother to get you to sign. I would advice using one of the Amazon mailbox stations at the QT gas station or where ever they are closest to your location. Much safer."
B06Y14T5YW,Daniel Hur,5,"Hardware is top notch. The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. Music fans will love the SD card support and 3.5mm jack. (Yes, it's still able to store your old massive collection of MP3s AND you can enjoy it with your expensive wired headphones!)
Battery lasts the day (unless you're in a cell deadspot) and will get you through the night if you do a rapid top up around noon.
The unit is mostly waterproof and will survive in the rain or shower (both tested) but it won't be much use under water and probably won't survive anything much deeper than a bathtub.
Software might not be to everyone's liking but it's the usual Android system underneath so you can change it however you like.
Only real downside is that it's so pleasant to use I don't use my expensive PC much anymore."
B06Y14T5YW,Glenda Richardson,5,"OK, I'm a mediocre tech, so this phone will do a million things I'll never ask of it, I'm sure. I'll leave the reviews of the actual S8 to those who can do it justice. I will keep my comments to the method of purchase, since if you're like me, you worry that the price here is so much less than at ATT. So, let me just say that the phone arrived in what appeared to be pristinely new packaging. Because my previous phone was an S5 I had to go to ATT for a new SIM card (nano vs micro). Anyway, they didn't charge me for the SIM. I haven't gotten a bill, so I don't know whether I'll have an activation charge, but that would be the case no matter where you purchase. After charging up the phone I started all the opening, transferring, updating. That took an hour or so I think. After that I could text and connect with ease. But, incoming phone calls were so horrible I was just sure I'd screwed up. Online research led me to rebooting the phone and that immediately cleared everything up. All of the startup had apparently set something off. So, I'm VERY pleased with my purchase. I saved over $250 by buying it through the Amazon link as opposed to the ATT plan!!!."
B06Y14T5YW,Peter,5,"** I've decided to update my original review as a year has almost passed. **

After following with the Apple fan boy of owning an iPhone, I decided to make the switch to Galaxy as it was cheaper than the iPhone X and I could always expand the storage as needed. Insert a 128 GB microSD card into the phone and I have enough storage for photos, apps, and the likes in addition to the 64 GB of storage the phone already came with. What I don't like when I had an iPhone was that Apple tends to make old device obsolete, slow, or both when a new product comes out. My Galaxy S8 hasn't slowed down one bit or suffer any problems. This is my second phone that I own that supports quick charge (after the S7). I love how I can just leave it on a wireless charging pad and check on it a couple hours later to see it fully charged.

Mind you that not all cases can allow quick charge. My wallet style case, for example, has to empty the cards before I can charge it (which is a minor issue). Phone doesn't have a single scratch on it and I'm pretty rough with the phone when at work."
B06Y14T5YW,Polaris0,5,"This is a sharp looking phone. It is the only phone I have ever owned, including the previous galaxies where people have inquired about it because of it's looks. The fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient. My main downside is the software, which might be on Samsung or might be on Android. Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. Not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever.

Camera: Excellent
Battery: So far, excellent. I don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode I still have at least 30% left at the end of the day.
Screen: Really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and I don't like cases
Size: I don't like big phones but this one is okay-ish
Feel: Just great and not cheap
Headphone Jack: No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom.
Tray SD: Not a fan of this tray crap. Worried about getting it jammed and placing the card correctly. The old system was much better.
Bixy Button: Don't use it, no idea but it is annoying if you don't use it
Always On Display: Pretty nice but not necessary
LED Indicator: The best feature and probably one of the only reasons I am brand loyal"
B06Y14T5YW,JO ANN,1,I ended up going to the hospital and was unable to make the return date of February 3rd. I have had nothing but PROBLEMS with this phone. UNLOCKED is joke! Voice problems. Problems not properly connecting to my carrier. Glitches in the speaker system etc. The phone diverts back to a "prepaid" credit card phone status and cannot make outgoing or incoming calls. I've tried different sim cards and hours worth of TECH support to get this phone working. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Will try to work with Amazon a little bit more to resolve the issue.
B06Y14T5YW,EC,5,"I was getting sick and tired of my one day battery life on my old phone. The Samsung S8+ is rated higher than the S9+ for battery life so I went for it. It was several hundred dollars less than what Verizon wanted. I charge it every other day now. The bad: Well, not that bad. My Verizon caller ID no longer worked because this is an unlocked version (kind of generic so to speak) Also my Verizon voicemail (visual voicemail) was not available. Big deal,I found another. No issues. I am using the free app Hiya for caller ID and block. Awesome."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"phone won't call or text even though it says it is connected. Try over and over then in an hour or so it will work.
the window for returns is way to short for something that costs $500. I sure hope I don't need it to call 911 before I can replace it. If Galaxy won't help replace this I don't think I'll ever buy anything form them again."
B06Y14T5YW,Joshua Parker Ramey,4,"I'm typing the review on the phone right now so it would be rather difficult to take a picture of the product, but that being said. I'm very happy with the phone and only have minor complaints about it.
The Good:
Great and quality display
The speakers are better than most phones from this particular generation
I'm yet to have the phone crash or have any major problems
Great INITIAL battery life (will come back to this)
Camera quality is astounding even on lower settings
The bad:
The bixby button is a satan spawn and never should have been made into an actual button. ""Okay Google"" is far superior in basically every way.
The battery life I've found has steadily declined in only a few months. It used to I could go almost a full day and a hald without charging. I purchased the phone I think in June and it's now December 31st, 2018 at the time of my review, and I have to charge 2-3 times a day usually with the same amount of use.
Also did I mention the bixby button?
Conclusion:
All in all a great phone with a great interface and very user friendly as well as good durability with very few complaints about it"
B06Y14T5YW,CJ,5,"This is a very fast and attractive phone. It is narrow enough to hold comfortably in your hand but still has a large screen. The camera takes sharp pictures and is quickly accessed from your lock screen. I like the edge menu and customized it to give me quicker access to apps I use most. Audio in all forms gets great playback quality. The speakerphone is loud and clear for video or voicemail playback and there is customization in the sound menu to tailor headphone audio to your hearing spectrum. Battery life is good, generally lasting anywhere from a day to a day and a half, and power saving mode is easily enabled if you're low. I effortlessly enrolled it in Samsung Premium Care, but I purchased directly from Amazon, a Samsung authorized retailer. The phone is not perfect. I don't find Bixby useful and am disappointed about the inability to reassign its dedicated button. The phone has a quality feel, but the all glass exterior made me wary to use it unprotected and I wrapped it in a case and screen protector immediately. The curvature on the screen edges also makes it difficult to find and install suitable screen protection. Overall, this phone does everything I want, it¡¯s unlocked so I don't have to root to cut carrier bloat (although there is some Samsung bloatware) and none of my complaints outweigh the things it does well."
B06Y14T5YW,WD40,3,"Learning experience
I¡¯ve been out of the phone market for a long time. Our Samsung S3 & S4 were excellent for many years. They started crashing, so it was time to buy new. I did not want to spend a grand on new phones, so started with Motorola G6 from Costco, on sale for $189. Before I get into the details, while speaking with my carrier tech support, I was directed to Amazon and the S8 on sale for $449.00. That is a grand for two phones. I sat down with the Motorola and Samsung side by side.
My old phones had visual voice mail (no data required) and I could send photos via text through wi-fi to save on data. Neither the Motorola or Samsung will do that, and after speaking with a bunch of folks apparently no new phones will do that without third party apps. Data must be turned on to use visual voice mail or send photos. What a rip-off. You would thing since the consumer spends a significant amount of money on Samsung products or whatever brand you prefer, they would be vastly superior to the old phones-not so. Buy a carrier-based phone and they have an app for visual voice mail, but not so for unlocked phones. Using the phones side by side for a few days, I did not see the value of over double the price of the Samsung vs. the G6, so the new S8¡¯s go back to Amazon. I¡¯ve always been a Samsung fan, but am disappointed that the industry has gone this route. Wish my old S4 still worked, I¡¯d keep it."
B06Y14T5YW,jay,5,"I purchased this phone as an upgrade for my HTC M9 that was getting long in the tooth and wasn¡¯t a good value as a trade in. I was going to go for a Hauwei Mate SE, but research showed that it may not be a good match for my Samsung Gear S3 running Samsung Tizen software. Since I'm accustomed to the watch which played well with the M9, I spent the extra on the used S8 plus. Thankfully it arrived in near new condition and has worked flawlessly so far at a substantial discount for a larger size, high quality product with reasonable up to date specs, while I get to keep the full functionality of my watch. The Tizen thing kind of sucks since I did get a Mate SE for my wife and it¡¯s a great upgrade option to her M9 and she gets a brand new phone vs a used Samsung, Apple or other top tier phone, even if it¡¯s more of a midrange phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Ian I Zaldivar,5,"Honestly, samsung really hit it big with this one. Although I'm sure the Note 8 is even more impressive, I've found perfection in the S8. Super fast processor, radiant screen that takes up the entire phone, amazing specs and of course the design was well thought through. I'm living it. I won't be buying the s9 because I'll wait till something surpasses this by a mile!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Thomas Zachary,5,"First off, I bought this phone with my own hard earned money and bought it through Amazon. This is not a sponsored review.

I've had Samsung Note phones because I like the big screens. My old note 3 (which I loved) starting having problems with WiFi and GPS reception. So I started looking for replacement phones and found this one.

My carrier is Verizon. You have to go into the Verizon store with your old phones sim card so they can burn you a new sim card. I was expecting to get a hard time from the store and was surprised at how nice the experience was! They took my old sim, created a new sim in about 5 minutes with no charge! Very nice.

And now on to the phone. So I was loving my old Note 3 and didn't really expect to have that much of a better experience.. wow was I wrong.

So this is not a comprehensive review , just some of my observations and things that I really liked about this phone. Also, bear in mind I've been using older Samsung Note phones for the past 5 years. So all the tech upgrades are fun.

- The screen:
Almost as wide as the 5.7"" screen on my old Note 3 but is taller. So text is almost as large but with more space for content. Of course, resolution is amazing, colors pop and this thing gets really really bright. The first time I used it in full sunlight I was amazed! I could actually see text perfectly in FULL SUNLIGHT. Wow... what an improvement over my old phone. I was also worried about the curved sides of the screen distorting text and pictures and such. No problem at all. I still feel the curved edges are a bit of a gimmick but it does not detract from the usability of the phone. And no I don't care about any of the edge menus and stuff like that.

- The CPU / Speed
I thought my old Note 3 was fast. This thing is blazing fast. I mean, everything you do is almost instantaneous. Now I'm spoiled and expect everything to pop up instantly.

- The Camera
I've got it set up so that if you press the power button twice the camera comes up. It comes up instantly. You can take a photo immediately. Then you can take at least 1 photo a second. The photos look great.

- The speaker
It's mono and on the bottom of the phone. At least 50% louder than the speaker on my old Note 3, at that was loud. I'm so happy with the speaker on this phone, I can listen to podcasts when I'm in the kitchen. I just pop the phone on the granite counter and crank the volume and I don't need an external speaker like on my old phone. Again, I'm pleased and surprised. Phone calls on the speaker are loud and clear.

- The fingerprint reader.
Wow... It's instantaneous. Seriously. You place your finger on the sensor and it's on in less than a second. So easy.

- Weight and size.
It's taller than my old Note 3 but lighter and slimmer. Still fits in my back or front pocket fine. I've got it in a case with a pop socket in the back. Drilled a hole in the case so that the pop socket is attached to the back glass on the phone. So the pop socket is secured to the phone, acts as a handle and a mini stand when I place it on a counter to watch a video.

- Wireless charging.
Picked up a $15 wireless charger from Amazon. Very nice. I just lay it on the charger when I go to sleep. Super convenient.

- SD card capable.
Took my old 64 gig SD card from my note 3 and popped it into this one. Nice, all my books and videos, photos and tunes came along for the ride.

So anyway... I'm really glad I bought this phone. no regrets at all. I really don't have any cons. I just dig it.

Very nice upgrade from my Note 3. Highly recommended."
B06Y14T5YW,Natty,5,Had this phone for a couple months now and I thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera. The quality of the camera (which is important to me because I take a lot of pictures) is great and I like the sleek design. Be careful of the always on display. It can burn your screen.
B06Y14T5YW,Luke S,2,"Had it for 10months now, price has dropped by about 90 bucks since then.

Supposedly made out of ""Gorilla Glass"" , sounds tough right? Well it didn't survive a drop from my hands onto a concrete floor, it's now cracked badly with chunks chipping off of the corners. They should call it extra-brittle baby monkey glass and not give the material a tough name, because it isn't tough.

The worst problem is that the phone has never been improperly exposed to moisture yet it now constantly refuses to charge and claims that it has ""detected moisture in the charging port"". This is with OEM chargers and cords as well as aftermarket stuff. I'm stuck trying to reboot the phone all the time to get it to stop complaining and refusing to charge. Sometimes It will decide the phone is wet mid-charge and I go to pull it off the charger and it has fully discharged when I am expecting it to be full.

It has been telling me software updates are available, hmm maybe there is a fix for the incorrect ""wet usb port"" message I have been getting. Well I don't know because it will only allow me to download the update over WIFI, despite having an unlimited data connection that I use for 100% of my web use. I took it with me to the gym and used their wifi to download the update and it installs. Then it says there is another after I leave , so I use the grocery store wifi and it updates again. Then it says there is ANOTHER so I go to a book store and it says it is fully up to date. Then I leave and it renegs and says it needs to download another 1.5gig update... Guess what, I don't have wifi because I use my phone to tether for web browsing. And I'm tired of driving around bumming wifi, this is unacceptable when every other app can download or update with my 4G data connection.

The specs are good and the screen gives a nice image. I like that this phone still has an SD card port, I wish they still came with a removable battery like older models. However just like any other android phone I have had, when I use it on roadtrips with a navigation app and pandora playing, one or both of the apps will eventually stop responding and the phone can get pretty warm while plugged in running that stuff for hours. This isn't necessarily Samsung's fault, could be the apps. Anyway it often times requires a reboot to get everything running again which is very distracting and not appreciated while rolling down the highway. Also can really hose you when the nav freezes up just before you need to navigate a complicated interchange.

The screen / digitizer replacement is still VERY expensive, and I don't know if I want to wrap up any more money on this thing because it has a charging problem. Would not buy again, which is pretty lame because I have had better luck with the non premium Galaxy phones in the past."
B06Y14T5YW,mxmo,3,"The phone came in it's original box. At first glance it looked like everything was in order but upon further inspection the booklet was nowhere to be found. The headphones included weren't the usual Samsung brand ones but AKG ones. I found the sound quality of said ear pieces to be subpar to the Samsung ones, not to mention that one of the covers that held the logo of the brand AKG came loose after 3 days of use. Next on the list are the charger and the USB-C cable, we own another S8 so we compared the USB-C ends of both. The cable that came with the new device had a slightly longer end that didn't fit either device properly, not to mention that the inside was a different colour and looked sligthIy damaged. No matter what cable was being used or what device was being charged the charger would emit a loud and annoying buzzing until whatever was being charged had full batteries.

The phone is performing well although it's important to note that upon first startup the phone didn't go through it's first setup process but instead went straight to the home screen. All other accessories were present in the box. tried contacting the seller regarding the issues I found to no avail. The phone is excellent, however I would not recommend the seller."
B06Y14T5YW,Oph1234,4,"I'm typically a nexus/pixel phone user. I got this phone as a replacement after my last phone didn't even last past 6 months. So far it's fine. There was a bit of a learning curve for me even though it's still android. There are a bunch of apps preloaded from samsung that I will never use and I'm not really a fan of the curved edge screen. I'm constantly accidentally hitting the sides while just holding the phone and it will either swipe to a different screen or open an app I didn't mean to open. However, the screen is very responsive which is (usually) a good thing. The ""ok google"" voice assistant doesn't work as well as it did with my google phones and I find bixby to be terrible so I've disabled that. The sound quality is great - actually better compared to my old pixel. I do wish this phone was slightly smaller. I have small hands and it's really cumbersome to hold this."
B06Y14T5YW,Linda Fox,5,"I use TracFone, and was hesitant to buy something so expensive without an ironclad guarantee that this unlocked phone would work. You have to buy the TracFone Bring Your Own Phone SIM activation kit (I got this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713WH1Y9/ref=twister_B071G7MDJY?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) Others before me have written detailed awesome reviews. I just wanted to put my two cents in that if you use TracFone, this phone will work for you."
B06Y14T5YW,Phillip Giggie,5,"Let me begin by saying that due to the poor reviews and questions regarding whether the phone has a manufacturer warranty or comments that the phone was not new, received without included accessories, or stopped working shortly after being purchased, I went direct to Samsung to purchase an S8 as my S6 suddenly stopped working.
I had no problem paying a slight premium to know that I'd be getting a warranty and a new phone, however after placing my order on Samsung.com, I was informed the S8 was backordered for two weeks. Since I was without a phone and AT&T wanted over $900 to purchase up front, I didn't have much of a choice and decided to try purchasing this one from Amazon.
I placed my order on Friday, purchased the supplemental warranty from SquareTrade, and my phone was delivered just as I got home that evening. Even with the SquareTrade warranty, the total price was still less than what Samsung wanted just for the S8.
The phone was in the original Samsung packaging and contained all of the standard accessories including the wall charger, cord, adapters for a USB to Micro USB and Micro USB to USB-C, headphones, pamphlets, and the protective plastic on the phone. It was clearly brand new.
I logged into my Samsung account after setting the phone up and entered the IMEI number. The phone came right up and stated a valid Samsung warranty. I confirmed this with Samsung customer service as well. The warranty is for 12 months and covers everything aside from water and physical damage, so the SquareTrade warranty should cover the physical damage portion.
As for the phone itself the picture and sound quality is fantastic, the camera is great, and it is overall super user friendly. Battery life is OK as it will run a full day with heavy use, but my S6 was nearly dead by early afternoon so I can¡¯t complain.
Overall I¡¯m very happy with this purchase. Received the phone hours after ordering and it was in perfect condition with everything I expected. I have AT&T and I just inserted my SIM card and was good to go. I understand the negative reviewers may have had bad experiences so I cannot comment on the consistency of the phones but mine was great all around."
B06Y14T5YW,Sora,5,"Was reluctant at first but this has proved to be one of my smartest tech purchases this year! Bought used for under $430 from Amazon Warehouse vs the over $800 new price tag from my carrier Verizon (even though this model is 1 gen older than newest galaxy model). Description said repackaged but nothing else about wear and tear. Be careful since some items may have slight damage, every listed used product comes with a pretty accurate description of physical wear so pay attention! Plus buy only through Amazon, even their Warehouse Used Items comes with same great return policy and exchange in case something goes wrong.

My phone arrived timely and came repackaged with all accessories. Looks and feels completely brand new! Have been using it all week and it has been working fantastic! Took 10-15 mins to figure out how to transfer service from my old LG phone to this S8 and works flawlessly on my Verizon.

Was even able to register warranty on Samsung's official site until next year. Great deal and saved me over $400 from buying new from my phone carrier. Thanks Amazon Warehouse!"
B06Y14T5YW,Philly Buster,4,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is very powerful, very large screen with excellent picture quality. From a usability standpoint, there simply isn't many better phones out there. But the curved screen, while unique, leaves a bit to be desired. When gripping the phone, it's easy to touch things on the sides. And when apps are not optimized for the curve, some ""buttons"" may be on the curve and difficult to click on (good example is a X for closing an ad. Might be right on the curve of the glass). Also, it's difficult to find a good case and that case may not be able to fully protect the phone. This is because the case cannot fully cover the sides of the phone due to the curved glass.

My next phone will not have curved glass."
B06Y14T5YW,Airean,3,"So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine. Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with ""Hi, Bixby"". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is ""Ok, Google"". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil."
B06Y14T5YW,Rnuzz,4,"Relative to what I would have paid if I'd gone full price, I'm happy with the phone overall.

I did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device I ordered on my own and with enmployees at the ATT store and none of us could find any imperfections so A+ in that regard.

However, after less than two months the speaker is terrible. It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.

Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect. I still expected the glass screen to be more resistant to scratches."
B06Y14T5YW,Deanna Covert,5,"I wanted to write a review about the product because other reviews helped me when deciding on whether or not to get this phone. All
I can say is get this phone. The phone itself is beautiful. It's sleek and fits nicely in your hand. The processor is fast, it's very responsive, and all around a great phone for this price. I've always been an Android user and this phone doesn't disappoint. Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is, how the battery isn't as good as other Samsung phones, and the list can go on and on. Regardless of those things, I think it's still an all around great phone, because nothing is perfect. For this price, I would recommend getting this phone! Just remember to keep it protected no matter what! Hope this review helped other skeptical buyers! :)"
B06Y14T5YW,Dustyone,3,"I had this phone for about 2 weeks, but I ended up returning it. The camera was really great and took quality photos. I also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. But ultimately I didn't enjoy the Samsung skin over Android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3. Additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"***Update 12/7/18- 9 months later and it's still awesome. No problem! I highly recommend this phone and the seller also.
Buy it. You will not regret it.

02/22/18
I am happy I ordered this phone. It came on time and the condition is just excellent. The charger, an earpiece with extra ear buds, an eject pin for the sim card slot came in the box. There was no form of scratch on the phone. It looked pretty new!!! I have been using it for a few days now and it works well. Also, I must say i got my metro pcs SIM to work in it and it was like a 123 set up. The signal is good. Overall, it's a great phone eventhough it maybe be too early to tell. I will give an update in a few months time."
B06Y14T5YW,Reg,5,"I have been a long time iPhone user and got fed up with the shenanigans of Apple, not to mention having a username and password for everything and they must be different. The straw that broke the camels back for me was when I got locked out because I entered the incorrect appleid password. At least that is what the phone stated. I then received an email stating it would take a month to send me a new appleid :( BIG BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT.

I thought that is it I am moving to an Android. I knew there would be a learning curve but I love exploring and making things work so I took a leap of faith. I am not sorry at all. It is much more intuitive than the iPhone."
B06Y14T5YW,Caty,5,"I love it. It works like a charm. I just wish they kept the LED notice lights where I could program the different apps and callers with as with the older versions. You should download the Google keyboard, I kept hitting the period button instead of the space bar with the key board that it came with."
B06Y14T5YW,brandy wolford,3,"Phone is nice but doesnt support WIFI calling which is an extremly important feature for me. I assumed it would since it was backed by Samsung and such a newer phone but it does not. I didnt realize this until I argued with my carrier about poor service for a few months and discovered it waa the phone not being able to use WIFI calling in the areas i had less coverage, by that time i was told it was to late for any refunds or exchanges and they made the suggestion i try to sell the phone to someone who doesnt need WIFI calling..."
B06Y14T5YW,M. Alvarado,1,The title of this phone states that it is an unlocked phone by Samsung and works on all networks and is a "U.S." version. These are all lies. The IMEI number was BLACKLISTED and even after calling Samsung they informed us it was NOT a "U.S." version but rather an international version which would not work....a complete waste of time and ruined what was going to be a Christmas present for a family member.
B06Y14T5YW,S. Taylor,4,"Great, great phone. If I could change one thing it would be the glass backing. I removed my case because it degrades the quality of photos greatly. I walked into a cement pylon while walking around sightseeing and it ended up cracking the back glass just below all the important stuff. Thankfully it all still works but I wasn't running, just walking, and the compression between my leg and the pylon was enough. About the only issue I have had with it that is Samsung's ""fault""."
B06Y14T5YW,seniormerc,4,The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. Take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. My biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately I had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and I lost them all. Very disappointing.
B06Y14T5YW,T Smith,4,"That was a great price. Took the nano sim straight from our One Plus 2, inserted and booted up and worked 100% (tmobil). Painless switchover! Battery is better than my S6, not twice the life of when the Sy was new, but significantly longer between charges. My S6¡¯s camera is still hard to beat, but for processing, graphics speed and display, and the extensible storage make this a clear winner!"
B06Y14T5YW,Debra B.,5,"After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about purchasing this phone, from this seller. But I had no problem with having Verizon activate this phone. I am on a prepaid plan with Verizon kamma and all they did was walk in to the Verizon store ,and he put the SIM card in, he got on the phone ,asked me a few questions and it was activated. When I told him what I read online , about some Verizon reps saying the phone wasn't compatible, he agreed that there may have been a ploy to get them to return that phone, and buy it through the Verizon store. Considering I live in the northeast, and we have had several snowstorms , The seller kept me updated as to when my prime Amazon delivery would get to me. It was due to be delivered on a Thursday, but was ultimately delivered on Saturday. Absolutely great experience all the way around"
B06Y14T5YW,C. Cole,1,"I was supposed to receive the SM-G955UZKAXAA , but received a SM-G955FZKDXSG instead. What I received is not compatible with Verizon. This is a phone for the middle east, not the US. Attached is a picture with the phone info showing it is a United Arab Emirates phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Paula Atkinson,5,"Very happy to find the Samsung S8 unlocked version on an Amazon Warehouse deal. I saved tons of money, and the phone came brand new in the box with plastic protectors still on and everything intact. One CAUTION about buying an unlocked phone is some features that your carrier offers may not work. For instance, I have AT&T, and I don't have Visual Voicemail on this phone. You should research online before you buy an unlocked phone for your particular carrier and see what may not work on the unlocked version. But other than the minor nuisance, I love the freedom of being able to take the phone to whatever Network I may want to use. In terms of the phone itself, I personally don't like the curved screen aspect at all. But it works very similarly to my Samsung S6 (RIP), and you pretty much have to keep upgrading (unfortunately) to keep a fast, functional, supported phone."
B06Y14T5YW,AJ Cable,3,"First and foremost, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has been one of my favorite Android smartphones of all time. The camera quality, for amateur photographers like myself, is pretty darn good. Furthermore, the processor is super fast and responsive, which compared to the Galaxy S5 that I had, is a huge upgrade. Also, the battery life is amazing. For me, with excessive use of listening to music, scrolling through social media, and other nonsense stuff, the charge lasted from 5-6am to around 10pm or 11pm. Overall, I was very impressed with the phone.
Some things that I personally did not like:
- the side button that kept triggering the assistant was super annoying. Even after disabling the assistant, hitting the button would still bring up the interface for it
- audio quality wasn't the greatest; however, what phone has perfect audio
- the screen size was also larger than the standard screen size at the time. So videos and images taken with other devices didn't fit perfectly on the screen, which was slightly annoying
Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase of a certified refurbished phone from Warehouse Deals, Inc UNTIL my phone wouldn't turn on one day while I was studying abroad in Costa Rica. I tried both hard resetting and soft resetting the phone to try to get it turned on, but nothing worked. Eventually, once I returned to the US, I sent the phone into Samsung, mistakenly thinking my phone was still under warranty, and it turns out that whoever declared the product that I received as ""certified refurbished"" was clearly mistaken as there was a huge problem with the circuit board with my phone that was more than likely caused by this ""refurbishing"" process or by the previous customer who had sold the phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. Furthermore, since Amazon does not supply the IMEI number on the receipt, Samsung could not fulfill the request to fix the phone per the warranty, and I would have had to pay over $600 to repair it. Moral of the story, I recommend buying a warranty, either through Samsung or Amazon, with the purchase of a certified refurbished phone to avoid the hassle that I went through, unless you want to waste $500 on a phone that only lasts 3 months due to a hardware malfunction."
B06Y14T5YW,J. R. Smith,1,I just discovered that the Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone I bought in early October from Mercate is a dummy phone used for display. I also received 3 iPhone chargers with this "phone." I paid $549 for an alleged phone that is empty inside. Why so long to discover I've been ripped off? I am the full-time caregiver for my 98 y/o mother with little time for myself. I went online & watched YouTube repeatedly trying to get the phone open. I purchased a charger. I couldn't believe I had been ripped off until yesterday when a technician opened the " phone" & I saw it was empty inside. I am retired & not wealthy & sick to realize I might have given Mercate $549 for nothing.
B06Y14T5YW,Brian Bear,5,"Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone.

The Camera is amazing
The screen is amazing
The fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does.
I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems.
it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems.
It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it.
Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable.

And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible."
B06Y14T5YW,Stephanie,5,"Love it!!! I accidentally dropped it in my dogs bowl of water, fully submerged, two days after I received it and 1 month later still works like a champ, no glitches, nothing."
B06Y14T5YW,Seasalem,5,I've had three different iPhones but I have been disappointed in the direction Apple has done with the hardware of the newer phones and price. I really I'm glad I made the switch and Samsung Galaxy 8+ phone six months in is working great. My only complaint is the Bixby button is worthless and causes you issues at times when you meant to only change the volume. Speaking of volume the external speaker is not all that great but I usually use head phones so no worries. Honestly I can do everything I did on the iPhone and more with the Samsung oh and I never have to worry about memory something Apple is pathetic in pricing as well.
B06Y14T5YW,Alyssa Ashton,1,"Box did NOT come with the Samsung factory seal, meaning it wasn't new. I didn't even turned it on, just returned it."
B06Y14T5YW,Krunal,5,"Samsung is on a roll right now when it comes to making flagship devices. The S8 bundles in good looks, an amazing screen and some great software features.

I was a bit hesistant buying a samsung phone due to their infamous software lag and heavy skins on top of android. But this UI is much better than previous samsung releases.

The only cons are the late software updates and possiblity of the phone slowing down in a couple of months. But for now everything works great."
B06Y14T5YW,IronianKnight,5,"As good as they say, far as I can tell. Very responsive, good storage capacity, The UI is good, cameras are outstanding compared to the average phone. The fingerprint scanner's position next to the camera is not so hard to get used to, and there's a biometric scanner as well if you're interested in health readings like heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Preloaded apps aren't intrusive, and don't clutter the system much."
B06Y14T5YW,DreamsiclesASMR,2,"If WiFi Calling worked, I'd have kept this phone. Unfortunately, even though the online user manual states how to use wi-fi calling, for this specific model, it is not available, for this specific model. (Unlocked, re: unlocked user manual states it is a feature, and it is not due to software incompatibilites, which is likely a non-FCC compliant issue with the software!).

So good luck to anyone that wants this phone. It works splendidly aside from not having what it claims within its own user manual. Since that was about 75% of the reason I got the phone, it's getting returned."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black) - US Warranty
Took a little bit of finagling to get the phone activated via. Verizon called to get sim card shipped, then had to turn off Family Base because it is a carrier-based product. After researching found this is common with unlocked phones. But once that was done, phone active and running flawlessly so far. Big jump from S5 this phone replaced."
B06Y14T5YW,James,4,"I have been using apple product for a while and have gotten used to them. I am still getting used to this phone.
Pros:It takes better pictures than my Iphone 6.
It seems to have a better battery life (for now)
You can buy your own additional memory without paying apple.
Cons: Be prepared to buy yet another charger cable.
You will need to download some of your apps or have to search for a new one.
You will have to search for some of your photos, mine got jumbled up. I didn't lose them but I couldn't find them too easily."
B06Y14T5YW,Pankaj Gupta,5,"Amazing phone. Just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iPhones. Better screen. More memory. Expansion slot. Better form. +Fingerprint sensor. Great iris sensor, and a good face detection. Better software controls because unlike iOS, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.

I used to be an iPhone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what I should want from my phone. I use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes."

DO NOT BUY THIS. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM , BUT INSTEAD I GOT AN EMPTY BOX WITH FAKE JEWERLY IN IT. THE SELLER NAME IS SAMSUNG ,BUT IT IS NOT. ""DONT BE FOUL"""
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"Awesome phone, I have seen some people say they got ripped off or not everything was in the box. You have to buy it from Amazon not another seller, that's what I did and it was brand new. Phone is really nice bit screen but it's thinner than most phones in a good way. No negative complaints so far. Had a few galaxies in the past and iPhones I switch every other phone between the two companies and this is probably the best galaxy yet I would say, the bixby button is annoying though."
B06Y14T5YW,DeluXXXe,4,"YES!!! It works on Verizon wireless. I took out the sim chip out of my working s6 and plugged it into the s8 and it just worked!!! Nothing else needed, no activation needed.

This is an early review.. Ill append as I fiddle around with the phone.

Con: NO IR blaster (so no controlling infrared devices like a TV or Cable box unless theyre ""smart"" devices on the same network) so you cant use it as a universal remote control like I did with the S5 and S6"
B06Y14T5YW,Encie,5,"I know I shouldn't be surprised how much nicer the Galaxy S8 is than my S4, but good golly! It's not difficult to make the transition; the way it works is very similar. But it's got like an intuitive little brain inside it that knows exactly what I want to do next! I love it. And they say old dogs can't learn new tricks. I feel so technologically capable and advanced!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Okay. There are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly I absolutely LOVE this phone. I used to have an s5 until it got old. I switched to LG for 6 months and I missed my galaxy phone. So I decided to splurge and get myself an s8! That being said... this phone NEEDS A GOOD CASE. I work around concrete floors so I made certain to buy a solid, shock resistant case with protection around the edges. I also got a glass screen protector just out of paranoia. The phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work I need it to do with no problems. :)"
B06Y14T5YW,Janet A.,5,"Works great. Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. I cut it down with scissors and it did the job. If you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. Phone is fast and was easy to set up. Works well with T-mobile."
B06Y14T5YW,ERM,3,"This phone was not unlocked! Took it to Verizon and the tech could not get the SIM to activate. He tried 10 different cards so the problem was with the phone. I read other reviews that said the same thing. HOWEVER...there is a workaround! He had to put the SIM in another new phone, activate it, and then switch it to my phone. So glad it worked because I really like this phone and it was a lot cheaper than buying a new S9."
B06Y14T5YW,Madfrenchman,5,"The phone was delivered ahead of schedule which is always a plus and was exactly as advertised. Had no problem smart switching info from previous S4 and carrier activation (Sprint to AT&T) was seamless. BTW, Something not advertised, I did find that the S8 will not allow custom sounds to be tagged to individual contacts when messaging. Ring tones sure, but no messaging notifications. So now no matter who messages you, they all sound the same something to keep in mind if that's important to you. I'm told there are work arounds and Apps you can download, but..........
Will modify review later if anything changes."
B06Y14T5YW,Ramsey,4,"After 14.5 months of use. The battery is still strong. The buttons still work great.

The only Problem: The phone randomly restarts about 4 times a week. Which is a little annoying because sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the SD card after one of those random restarts. This forces me to restart the phone again to mount the SD card"
B06Y14T5YW,CLC,5,"I ordered this on Black Friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. I didn't expect to actually enjoy an Android based phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. My carrier fully supports this phone and I consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands."
B06Y14T5YW,Laura,5,"I bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. Great deal, based on other prices. I purchased this after my Galaxy S5 died. Coming from the S5, this is a major upgrade. The phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, I have it in a case. I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like ""her"" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him.
Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. I've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but I will update the review if my opinion changes."
B06Y14T5YW,KC,5,"The screen is incredible. One of the best Android phones out there if not the best. Camera is great in low light situations. Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day. Also has a quick charging feature if you use supported Qualcomm quick charge adapters. Only thing that annoys me is the Bixby feature. I basically have disabled it and switched over to the Google Assistant. Default Samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic. For example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well. Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos. Really clear when you've got the right content."
B06Y14T5YW,Alexis Mayor,5,"I just got my phone yesterday, it arrived in two days. I thing it should have been backed a little as only was shipped from an Amazon warehouse. The phone came in a box with very little padding. I have to say I love my new phone, at it was new not refurbished. I also had no problems registering it on the Samsung website. I was a little skeptical in purchasing this at first, there are many negative reviews when it comes to buying a cell phone. I am glad i bought and I am sure you will too."
B06Y14T5YW,Mark P,5,"My problem with buying a phone from a carrier has been after a few years, support for security updates were up to the provider. Problem is most smaller carriers do not maintain security updates. With this phone, you getting direct support from Samsung and getting the latest recommended patches."
B06Y14T5YW,Hazel,2,"I don't like how ever since I've gotten this it constantly closes apps without me actually closing it. It glitches, so I'm factory resetting the phone in order just to use it. Resetting only works for about an hour. I got 65 gigs of space but when I add more apps or even photos it gets extremely slow. It would be better if I just got the 16 gigs. I have been downloading multiple apps to speed it up or take off viruses. They dont work well. Maybe I'm miss using but using this phone gets me frustrated. I thought about giving it a few months just to fully get into the phone and I havent been able to stop the app closing and the glitching. I got more space than a 16 gig to use, not just to say I have 65 gigs of space."
B06Y14T5YW,Randy M. Carrillo,1,"I love the phone but i think i got one with a defect, it randomly freezes and turns off"
B06Y14T5YW,Mom2pcs,5,"Loving my S8+. Upgraded from Moto G5 Plus. Loving the big edge to edge display. Battery life is amazing. 15% battery on old phone estimated about 1 1/2 hours left. On the S8+, when I got 15% battery reminder I checked in settings and it estimated about 3 1/2 hours worth of battery left. Thought the S8+ might be too big, but now it feels like the perfect size and I'm glad I went for the bigger screen. Fast charging is awesome. Bought myself a wireless charger for the nightstand and I'm loving that feature, as well. Pictures are great. Phone arrived earlier than expected. Great seller. A+"
B06Y14T5YW,James Chestnut,1,This has to be the worst phone I have ever bought. I bought it in April of 2018.I have never had a Samsung phone before this one. I would rather use a flip phone than this. Picture quality looks like a 1mp camera. Apps stay running after they are closed. Constantly restarting the phone because it won't pick up on wifi. After it restarts your good for a day or two. Everything looks good on paper but placing it in the real world is totally different.
B06Y14T5YW,Elaine,5,4.5/5 for this phone. I am an iphone user making the switch to android. So far i really like the phone. Very easy to use. Definitely love the storage on this phone. Screen is very pleasing to the eyes. Only critque is the finger scanner. Too small and awkwardly placed in my opinion.
B06Y14T5YW,Robert Bitter,5,If you want a gorgeous device with a great camera and amazing specs look no further. When I got the S8 I was a little worried about it being used. To my surprise it was absolutely perfect. I had a couple concerns and after emailing the seller and they went above and beyond to help. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.
B06Y14T5YW,Jason H.,2,"The hardware is fantastic, superb looks and feels great in the hand. The SOFTWARE is absolutely horrible. It's so far removed from vanilla android it's like a completely different operating system, and you'll CONSTANTLY be annoyed with popups, nuisance reminders, and other annoyances. It constantly feels like your fighting with what Samsung likes to call ""The Samsung User Experience"". Samsung should give customers the ability and choice of running a vanilla port of Android and not this abomination of a UI,"
B06Y14T5YW,NikA,5,"Had a blackberry PRIV with Android that cost me gazzilion and died on me in about a year.
As soon as I turned this phone on, immediately noticed incredible difference as to the speed: opening apps, installing, uninstalling, opening and browsing the internet - bam! everything happens just about immediately with this phone, no delays, no ""thinking"" no crashing (so far).
One thing that annoys me a bit is really how sophisticated the phone is, like if you put it on a table screen down it will do certain things, face up others, tons of options for how the screen will behave what light what notifications even the movement of the phone itself makes it behave differently, basically I'd have to spend many hours figuring it out that's the only thing but I guess there are bigger problems out there.."
B06Y14T5YW,Austin Grace,5,"Switched from an iPhone 8 plus and have not been able to put it down. Beats the iPhone in every way. The radio reception is amazing as well. That goes for the cellular, wifi, bluetooth and gps. Such an awesome phone. It just works and the battery life is amazing. Samsung has done some nice touches to android. I love how bixby can help you optimize your phone for better battery life and clear the ram and cash. The build quality of this thing is amazing. Even beats apple. I would even recommend this phone in 2018. Yeah the S9 is coming but if you don't want the latest and greatest this phone is really worth a look."
B06Y14T5YW,Tieguy,5,"Only my 2nd day, but I think it's as expected. The phone arrived in what appeared to be a new box, I swapped the SIM, but the phone didn't ask the expected start up questions. My AT&T GO plan connected immediately on it's own. So I logged into my gmail account to establish the protection I read about and then took it to the AT&T store to reset to factory default. Process was easy to reset, and then the phone started asking all the startup questions. So I think I'm happy."
B06Y14T5YW,Harlem_chic,4,"Phone works great HOWEVER, I realized I cannot do the video calling to another Verizon customer as I did with my Samsung 7 phone. It's a Verizon feature that these unlocked phones do not have or come with. I actually loved the fact that you can be on a regular phone call then switch over to a video call. Will have to use the WhatsApp video call instead."
B06Y14T5YW,Sam,5,"I've only had the phone for a few hours, but I can confirm that it CAN be activated on Verizon. I bought 2 phones, went into my local store to get one of them activated. The clerk provided a SIM card and got it running in just a few minutes (but be prepared to spend two or three hours reloading your apps and configuring the phone's options).

Waited to set up my second phone until my wife got home this evening. I was planning on doing it myself online, but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself (the online tool wasn't accepting the numbers). I used Verizon's online chat, and the operator had it up and running in just a few minutes. No problems."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"Phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. For once I actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. Disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype."
B06Y14T5YW,Atharva,5,"The best phone ever! !
The specs of this phone don't speak out much, but this phone is filled with tons of features, just name the feature. It is thin, perfect looking, brilliant camera. Looks great in our hands. BATTERY My old phone used to consume around 80% of the battery life during the day but this phone has only consumed 35%. Amazing perforce. The new Bixby feature is a great move by Samsung. Google assistant makes the phone even better. The new screen off feature is too good. The edge feature is very usefull at times. Has fingerprint scanner face scanner and iris scanner. The iris scanner, my favorite, is super fast much better than the iPhone X. The finger print sensor is awkward in position but its super fast too. The screen is mind blowing. Dont hesitate to buy this... Worst every penny"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"What a great phone. So happy that I left Apple. Everything is great: camera, wireless charging, face or fingerprint sign-in, the built in speakers, the gorgeous screen, the headphone jack (!!!!)... A very smartly made phone, very reliable and quite a tool when you're out in the world - a powerful computer in your pocket. Even the free earbuds it came with are pretty good. It's a new world being a non-Apple customer.

Once I got a wireless charger for home and a wireless charger for the office, I appreciated this phone even more!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,I got this despite their description stating that it is not compatible with Sprint because people state that it did. After some time at the Sprint store to get my SIM card I managed to get it working with no problems. Just have to go to what they refer to as "corporate" sprint stores to get the SIM card and make a call and follow through.
B06Y14T5YW,Ramon G.,1,"I wa using the device until battery goes to 0% and turned off. I tried to charge it, but phone no powered up neither by wire charger or wirless charger.
After return the phone for warranty, Samsung found a PBA damage. But due to some scratches in LCD screen, they denied doing the repair under warranty, and demanded a repair fee of U$637.
Obviously, is cheaper buy a new one. But it is a better business for me to buy an Iphone."
B06Y14T5YW,Arun,4,"Good phone. Here are the pros n cons
Pros:
Good camera
Vibrant screen
Great battery life
Great looks
Cons:
Very difficulf to find right tempered glass. As the edge function will not eork well. You end up using samsung flip cover, which hides all the buty.
Preloaded apps and bixy button are painful."
B06Y14T5YW,Sam Leveritt,4,"Bought this phone for my wife. We have Verizon as our carrier so we were just a tad nervous if it would work or not. Received the item with no scratches or ding marks. Screen was perfect. Put in her SIM card from her S7 Edge and the phone immediately picked up Verizon. No issues. All of the apps on her old phone transferred perfectly to the new phone. Battery seems to be in great shape. It holds a charge very well. So far no issues what so ever. Keeping fingers crossed that it stays this way. We are Prime members so we knew we would be ok for the first couple of weeks if we had any problems with the product, but so far, all is good! Very happy."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"The phone is amazing and everything I expected. This review is to confirm other reviews and share what I had to go through to get this phone activated through Verizon.
I took the phone to Verizon to get a new SIM card (old Note 4 has Micro sim, this phone has Nano sim) and the Verizon employees said it was not Verizon compatible (error messages came up when they scanned the box) and I had to contact customer service to see if the phone could be added to the Verizon database. The customer service employee was very helpful and reassured me that the phone was Verizon compatible and everything looked good with the phone in their system when she looked up the phone's ID number. They mailed me a new sim card and walked me through over the phone on switching the new sim card. Everything worked well and my phone works fine on our Verizon plan. I saw other reviews of people in similar situations and wanted to confirm that Verizon's customer service was helpful and this unlocked phone worked for me on our Verizon plan by going through these steps. The Verizon store employees either do not have the power in store to recognize the phone or they tell you it is not compatible to try and get you to sign a contract through them and spend more money. Going through customer service was the way to go and within 4 days of getting the phone from Amazon, I got the new sim card from Verizon and my new phone is working great!"
B06Y14T5YW,Shardin,1,"Sad. Was looking forward to this phone and and opening, there were 2 piercings on the screen. Guess buying from AT&T is better?

Disappointed. 2nd item I have returned from Amazon in the last 5 years."
B06Y14T5YW,ruth,5,"I love this phone, this is the replacement of an iphone 5 and I don't miss it at all. Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple's strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn't make sense to me, it makes you think. After reading reviews explaining how Samsung has been releasing phones for years with technology that Apple now says is revolutionary with their Iphone X, my decision was easily made... the S8 is an excellent phone with all the bells and whistles for an amazing price."
B06Y14T5YW,Ethan N.,4,"For the most part this is worth the money. There is a slight scratch on the screen that isn't noticeable unless you try to look at it. Other than a small scuff on the top edge of the phone (which you can't see with a case on) it is in great cosmetic condition. Now the battery life is OK but not great. Auccu Battery says that only 2,879/3,000mah is being used so my battery life isn't as what a new phone would be like. The battery also gets a little warm while playing video games such as PUBG on Recommened settings. But the thing about that is that the seller never told me that this phones battery was in the shape that it is in."
B06Y14T5YW,Adam,5,"I upgraded to this phone from a ZTE Zmax Pro. This phone is incredible to any phone I have ever had. It is very fast and reliable. It's very well build and sturdy. I had problems with other phones in my area with my carrier and with this phone, I have not experienced any issues with my signal. Highly recommend."
B06Y14T5YW,Quenna L.,4,I was sent an international phone and found out there was no warranty. Was refunded my money with no hassle. Other than that this phone is a great phone. It came in the original packaging and seemed brand new But fragile so get a case and tempered glass protector. I will be re-buying because I loved it . hopefully I will be sent the the proper phone this time.
B06Y14T5YW,Naffy,4,"The phone was directly from Amazon Warehouse and was original. The weight and feel is great . Set up was easy. The was glitches so far or spontaneous restarting. Touch is good. There are lots of new features. The only problem was that notifications did not come in in real time in sleep mode....but, after digging around on the internet, I discovered that the battery usage and saving feature in special permissions was the problem. Works fine now."
B06Y14T5YW,Patrick Von Hyperborea,5,"I purchased a ""like new "" from Amazon with the Earth Day deal.I plugged in the phone and immediately saw the difference in display from my iPhone 7 and lightning fast response with beautiful curved glass.I was willing to forego a few features such as stereo speakers ,slow motion video and emoji characters to save over$300 compared to the S9 plus.After registration of my product with Samsung , 9 months left on the warranty, so phone was most likely a return because someone ordered the wrong product then sent it back."
B06Y14T5YW,Emmanuel Toma,5,"I bought this over the GS9 because the price is more than $100 cheaper, and it's the exact same phone as the GS9.
There are very MINOR, SUBTLE differences. It's not worth paying $140 more for a phone that is exactly like this one.

I'm very satisfied with my purchase decision. This phone is great!"
B06Y14T5YW,Ross A,1,"I should have spent more time looking into this phone. If you search - galaxy s8 searching for gps - you will find at the samsung support site entries dating from 5/11/2017 to today(2/6/2019) about its inability to function. I have tried the vague solutions they offer without success. Rare times after hitting start on google maps the directions work for about a minute or two, but never longer, and usually not at all. Messaging, email and gps directions are what I purchased this phone for. Avoid it if you need gps. Understand this is not directed at the seller, the seller performed as promised, quick delivery and as advertised."
B06Y14T5YW,Houseofdexter,4,"Bought this for the wife, as she had an S5 with 16 gig...and she was out of space and her text messages wouldn't come in. This S8 is awesome, the only downside is the stupid Bixby app(lost a star Samsung because you can't reprogram it)...would be nice if you could reprogram the button to launch a different app..."
B06Y14T5YW,purefocus,1,"Coming from an iPhone 6, I will say that it is much different. To keep this short, I'm glad I ended up switching. The picture quality based on the lighting can be so-so. Sound quality is not as great as the iPhone's was. Overall, still a 5 star phone in my opinion.

UPDATE: After having the phone for about 3 months, I started having issues with the phone freezing. It has only gotten worse over time, and I will probably be needing a new phone soon. Samsung refuses to make any kind of repairs on the phone as they ""haven't heard of the issue before,"" yet, when you look up the issue I'm having, there are loads of articles on the matter.

When I am unable to play 45 seconds of Pandora or Youtube without the phone freezing up, I think it's time to classify this as a poor design."
B06Y14T5YW,Lorrie Tschaenn,5,I worried about ordering 1 of these after reading the reviews over and over again.... I'm on prepaid straight talk.....omg ... all I did was take my SIM card out of my old galaxy s6 and placed in this one... well it works great.. the only problem I had was I have to put all of my contact's in... either from that please don't hesitate to buy....my phone is brand new
B06Y14T5YW,XaQaRa,5,"So far I love it.... After months of listening to my family tell me to retire my NEXUS 6 - Amazon made it easy [price-wise] for me to do just that. e phone is way smaller - something I have to get used to, but lightening quick with responses. The camera is great..I've only had it for 2 days, but it is pretty neat - so far. Pairs effortlessly with my car stereo and has many 'modern' features.... So far, so good...LOL If I should fall out of love with it - I will share that, too!"
B06Y14T5YW,Swamy,1,"I was so excited about this phone but what i got is an international version with non us adapter, I verified the IMEI number on Samsung site and it says no warranty:(
I have to return the phone now, such a waste of time :"
B06Y14T5YW,Andrew,5,"No issues connecting to Verizon aside from a little difficulty fitting the SIM card from my old phone into the caddy that pops out of the bottom of the S8+--a tight fit! Once inserted, the phone fired up immediately with no red Verizon screen on startup any more. From there, no problems making calls and texting. Would definitely buy again, though I wish someone would make a Verizon compatible phone with an even larger screen (7.0""+....anyone...anyone....?)"
B06Y14T5YW,Rick L.,5,"I moved up from a Galaxy S5, so this was relatively easy for me to adapt to. The speed is impressive, as is the image quality and sound. I am most impressed with it's long battery life, which was easily twice as long as my S5. I am enjoying my S8+ very much. The only slightly negative experience was getting Verizon to activate the phone. Two techs told me that it was not compatible with Verizon service. I convinced them to take a SIM Card from a floor model an try it in my phone. It worked, proving that it was compatible. I still had to call a higher level tech to get it activated."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"I don't usually leave reviews but this phone is stunning. I bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories. All for $40 dollars less than the listed Amazon price. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

A warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked. The water proof design is a life savior as my previous phones had died to h2o, it's nice to know this phone is safe against most situations."
B06Y14T5YW,Davebobman,5,"Overall, I am very satisfied with the phone. The camera is quite good but it doesn't handle low-light as well as I had hoped. The screen is definitely scratch resistant (you can scratch at the screen with your keys and it won't leave a mark). The glass (front and back) are NOT impact resistant and you can expect them to crack the first time the phone falls from your hands and hits a hard floor (I was aware of this issue beforehand, so no complaints here)."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,"It is as satisfactory as my Droid but the screen broke very easily, light impact. Two weeks old. So bummed as it was my first phone which I purchased outright. Get your screen covers immediately or a case with a cover.
Bixby button is where you hold the phone. If you don't use Bixby you spend frequent and frustrating moments accidentally turning it on and the of course off. Nuisance. Good photo quality.
If you use Page Plus, there is no Wifi Calling option provided for on their SIM card making good connection unreliable. Odd as it is the same Verizon network but what do I know?"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Paid 489.99, knowing it had cosmetic damage and used. Came with clear case and charger. Had phone for 2 days. Technology speaking: so far so good. Only two minor obvious scratches and 1 barely noticable (mind you it was to be expected) but both were on the back screen which appears to be easily replaced and I'm the type of person to take the time out to do that.the other is easily covered with a case...no front screen damage, came two days early; seems like a steal for an avg $800/unlocked phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Marcell Favalora,2,"i purchased my galaxy s8 and everything was great and running perfectly. After about a month or two of me having service under metro pcs (yes i know they arent the best) my phone randomly started saying that i couldnt receive service anymore. after taking it yo metro pcs, i was told they cannot really help me because it was not purchased from. the phone still works fine and this review was written from the actual phone but i cannot have service turned on because of (as it was explained to me) a problem with unlocked phones being kind of a roll of the dice especially when purchasing it online. i didnt want to go through fighting with the company to work a deal with samsung on my warranty because i didnt have time working 14 hours a day and seeing reviews saying that they dont help you anyway.
overall the phone is awesome and works fine. that has been my only issue and ive had the phone for nearly a year in 3 months. i guess you get what you paid for, saving a couple hundred but cannot get service. it works on wifi but cant call or text from it but i have to much on here to get rid of it or something."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Awesome phone! Works great with no issues with Verizon Wireless. I did have to go in and get a new SIM card however, since my old one was a micro-SIM, this phone uses the smaller nano-SIM card."
B06Y14T5YW,barry cantrell,5,i upgraded from the S5 to the S8 what a major difference i activated it on the verizon network and since i already had a verizon phone it was as easy as installing my verison sim card in the S8 and turning it on. I would highly recommend this phone
B06Y14T5YW,R Pyette,5,"Bought this phone as an upgrade from my previous phone. To put it bluntly, this thing is amazing. The way it feels in my hand is excellent. Now I have normal hands for a guy, so if you have smaller hands it may be a little big, but for me it was a perfect fit. The camera is a huge upgrade from my previous phone. The details are so crystal clear. The insane amount of settings really lets you customize your phone to what you want. The only thing I have to mention is Bixby. I turned mine off and downloaded the Google Assistant, but aside from that I literally cannot brag about this phone. If you're on the fence about it, just get it. Now I bought mine when it was $600, which as I'm writing this review Amazon has them priced at $720, so you might want to keep an eye on the price. But again, highly recommended. Amazing upgrade. Coworkers are jealous."
B06Y14T5YW,scott,4,Works with my Sprint account although I did have to go to the store to get a new SIM card in order for it to work but I was in and out of Sprint and 5-10 minutes. I tried to activate it at home and it wouldn't recognize that I was using a Galaxy S7 SIM card and it kept thinking it was a Galaxy S5. But nice phone just need to stop at the Sprint store take you 5 or 10 minutes if they're not busy and you'll be on your way good phone so far
B06Y14T5YW,K Davis,5,"I am very pleased with this phone. Amazon shipped it promptly and it was delivered on time. Moving from an S5 to an S8+ was so easy. The screen on this phone is amazing. You get that amazing screen without the phone feeling bulky. It is so thin and feels great in your hand. The battery life is incredible and the quick charge feature is great. Getting a screen protector on the phone was a bit different with the infinity screen, but well worth the extra effort to protect the screen. There are a variety of cases available."
B06Y14T5YW,Johnny,5,"The phone itself is great, but not the primary reason for this review. Amazon customer service is. Concerns were raised upon delivery when the seal on the box was compromised, but both items were still inside. Upon further inspection, I noticed there was no factory seal on the phone box itself, which essentially voids the ""new"" description of the phone. I immediately called customer service to voice my concerns and have them noted on the order. They understood and promptly began working on a solution. The adequate compensation was nice, but not my priority. Having the notes on the order in the event that I discover problems with the device was. I was told that if something should surface, the problem will be addressed, resolved, or replaced. I found comfort in that. So overall, Amazon customer service was great in this case. The device itself has exceeded my expectations so far, and would recommend it. In fact, I'll be looking into purchasing another for my other half."
B06Y14T5YW,Tech Wizard,5,"This phone is just amazing. With the included app and USB cable adapters it was super easy to transfer all my files, including text messages from my old Motorola Droid to this Samsung S8. For those that are wondering, I was able to easily set up this new phone up with Verizon. Did not even need to call in. Anyone who says this phone does not work with Verizon is wrong. I can't say enough good things about this phone. If you are thinking about it, just buy one. You will love it! Wish the speaker where a little louder, but otherwise this phone is perfect."
B06Y14T5YW,DW,5,"This phone will get the job done. It's very well built. Slippery but it's a glass sandwich, get an otterbox immediately! You can map the finger print scanner in back to bri g down the top menu which is very useful. The sensor is in a weird spot but you can add a multiple fingerprints, I use my two index and middle. Solves that issue. ""Facial recognition "" is quick but not too secure. Great processor for multitasking. All around great phone."
B06Y14T5YW,D. and C. H.,5,"This is, by far, the best phone that Samsung has produced. I believe it is even better than the Galaxy S9 because of the waterproof rating of IP68 versus the Galaxy S9 rating of IP67. All in all, it is a strong and powerful phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Sherri,5,"I bought this phone used. I was skeptical. I went on seller options and found one that was in good condition. I got a description of the exact phone. The seller indicated that the phone had a few scratches on the back but the overall condition was good. When I got the phone it appeared brand new, no scratches. It functions excellently. I've been using it since November and feel like I bought it brand new."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"I bought the phone on November 2017.
1. Two weeks of use and I started noticing a green line appears on the screen. When I searched, found that it is a common issue. I raised a request with Amazon and got the phone replaced.
2. I always use a phone cover. Close to one year of usage, I removed the phone cover to clean the phone. Noticed that the phone back cover has cracks. I have never dropped the phone. Not sure how the cracks came. Again when I searched about it, looks like many people have the same issue.
3. Now after 1 year and 2 months of use, the phone has completely stopped working. Keeps restarting and displays ""RAM dump by hard reset"". I can't get into boot mode or download mode to reset the phone. When I took to the Samsung customer care, they said it is out of warranty now and cannot be fixed. It seems that is a motherboard issue and they can't fix it.
Total waste of 600$.."
B06Y14T5YW,Derek Apseloff,5,I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages.
B06Y14T5YW,Anthony,5,"First of all, the phone was delivered in about 15 hours, which is crazy. I was concerned it might not be the unlocked US version...but, to my surprise, it is. Model number on the box and the actual phone checks out. I popped my Verizon sim in and it just...worked. 5 stars since it is the device the description stated and for helping me avoid stepping into a Verizon store."
B06Y14T5YW,Barbara Fenn,3,"Nothing wrong with this unlocked phone itself but it was not totally compatble with Verizon. Advanced calling features such as wifi calling, hd etc are not available. Also no 4g or 3g only lte. I do not recommend purchasing if you have verizon. Had to return phone and buy a phone with Verizon software."
B06Y14T5YW,anton,5,"Gorgeous phone. All glass. Fingerprint sensor location is not so bad as reviews indicate.
Disabling app power manager/optimize battery is a must for receiving notifications in timely manner. If you need just led notifications but no sound, you need to download and use silent.mp3 tone.
Bixby button not so scary since it can be remapped.
Looks frigile I would never use a case, so really hope I don't drop it.
Very nice deal at $460, thanks amazon!"
B06Y14T5YW,rachel miller,5,"This phone has been amazing so far, no issues and the battery last for quite awhile, anywhere from 8 to 12 hours or possibly more based on how often I decide to play games and text on my phone. The camera quality is beautiful and crisp and the option to filter out blue light is defently a plus since I stay on my phone before I go to sleep. I loved my LG G5 but this is my new baby."
B06Y14T5YW,DodgeEnthusiast,5,I purchased this as a surprise for my Wife as an upgrade to her existing S4. She was so surprised and happy when it was delivered. She has hardly When Wife is happy ... we're ALL happy!
B06Y14T5YW,donna m holland,1,The antenna stopped functioning after 3 months! Mighty expensive mistake. Warn everyone not to purchase!
B06Y14T5YW,Barbara Rose,1,"Ordered a new phone, says it will come unlocked. Was NOT new and definitely WAS NOT unlocked. Waste of time and money!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,M. Matthieu,5,"Such a great phone! After doing months of research, I wasn't sure which phone to choose. Pixel 2, LG V30, S8 or even iPhone. I finally decided the S8 has most everything I wanted. Wireless charging, great camera, decent battery and a perfect screen!

After a month, I am so happy with my decision! Wonderful phone, perfect!"
B06Y14T5YW,Orion,4,"Bought this version here directly from Amazon. So far so good.
For those wondering it does not have wi-fi calling. And although the item was bought here in the States and is the US Version, Samsung did not found the product's IMEI, therefore you can't register it at Samsung, so no warranty. I received a discount because of this."
B06Y14T5YW,Keek,1,Just got this phone today after waiting days in need of a phone. My excitement was replaced by ANGER when after an hour long conversation with support I am told that I can either send it to Samsung or return for a refund. The refurbished phones are locked & you cannot access them. Amazon knows this & they continue to sell them anyway. Amazon has crossed me for the last time!
B06Y14T5YW,M. Malm,5,After reading some of the questions and answers I contacted my local Verizon affiliate and told them that I wanted to activate this phone. I've been a good customer there over the years and they were eager to help me. Basically we activated a new micro SIM card in a used phone they had using my existing number. We then transferred the SIM card into this phone and basically the deal was done. I still had to log into my google account and use the Samsung transfer setup to move info but it all went smooth. Really enjoying this phone! What a camera!
B06Y14T5YW,cthirkill,5,"It was a huge upgrade from the galaxy note 4

The screen is very clear and large.
I'm still getting used to the weird way it screenshots but that's a software thing... and well it is mostly okay.
It's a fast working machine, the camera quality is amazing. I love taking underwater movies. It does not do underwater pictures well. It's like it doesn't register my fingers touching the screen when there's water all over it. But video is fine.
Battery life is fine. I'm on my phone a good amount, not watching movies but listening to music and social media and the battery will last me a day a night and a bit more."
B06Y14T5YW,Kyle Schow,5,"I know posting this review after only a day of usage might seem bad to do, but I love the phone. I got the phone, had Verizon pop my Sim card in and it was ready to use. No hassle or anything. The phone flies through anything. The curved screen allows for you to grip it easily and is a pleasure to look at with the sharp screen when reading or watching videos. My only concern down the line would be the battery, but I carry a power bank with me anyways so thats a minor grip. Thank you Amazon for the great price. I loved my S6 but this phone has Wob me over."
B06Y14T5YW,Clifford,5,Pleased. Be sure of passwords. I got in a mess. Very slippery. Get a good case.
B06Y14T5YW,Elizabeth Frangioso,5,"I just upgraded from the Galaxy S5. There's a little bit of a learning curve, but so far so good I love the phone. I have verizon as my provider. I went to the verizon store so they could help me active the phone, since I need a new SIM card. The phone was activated with no problems."
B06Y14T5YW,SylvanKnight,1,"Phone was defective, would not send photos in texts. After a lengthy investigation, Samsung tech support identified the hardware as defective, and authorized a return."
B06Y14T5YW,Zain syed,5,"Fast efficient and takes awesome pictures.
Only drawback is that the fingerprint sensor is beside the camera which might take some time getting used to and looks odd.
Awesome infinity display
Very thin and practically no bezels
Display : 9/10
Audio : 8/10
Speed : 8/10
Camera : 9/10"
B06Y14T5YW,AngieFromDelray,5,"Being a tech junkie I love my toys but hate spending a ton for them. Thank you for this incredible phone at an incredible price :-) Upgrading from an S5, this phone is super fast and after taking it to t-mobile to get the micro sim card, works flawlessly...so happy!"
B06Y14T5YW,Bunnie,4,"I was very happy that I upgraded to the S8 and was loving it all week until I realized it wouldn't let me connect to any wifi at all besides the one at my home. My college has free wifi and it worked perfectly fine on my S7edge, but on my S8, it said wifi is blocked. I tried wifi in Mcdonalds, parks, restaurants, and the wifi are all blocked. What on earth? It said I should contact my phone provider or what not and I am kind of really upset."
B06Y14T5YW,dom,5,"Been an iPhone user since the 4, up until this baby came into my life. Initially I was scared to take the leap but I'm glad I did. The s8 is the most beautiful phone I've come across and I'm so happy that it's mine. It does everything I need and more. If you're thinking about switching to Android, this is the sign for you to take that leap.

Fast shipping & perfect condition! All I had to do to activate mine (w Verizon) was transfer my sim card from my 6+ to the s8 and voila! I'm a very happy girl with my new s8 :)"
B06Y14T5YW,Andrew Borders,5,"Came packaged in different box,but was in fantastic condition!! Looked brand new! (Even if it was just a recently released phone and used) It definitely gets a thumbs up from me! And my wife is definitely loving her ¡°new ¡° phone!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,thetechguyaficionado,5,"Exactly as described. Samsung makes high quality products and the true rival to iPhones, if you are not an Apple fan.

-Pros:
Unlocked as described, just insert SIM Card and I'm in business.
Sleek design
Battery life is good (expected since is a new phone, let's see after a few months)
Updates to Android 8.0 Oreo without rooting it.

-Cons (for me)
Comes with Facebook pre-installed, can be disable if you are not a Facebook user, but can't be remove.
Bixby app (Samsung Assistant version of Alexa, ""Ok, Google""), not interested in another assistant"
B06Y14T5YW,Cody,5,Awesome phone. I got it when it was on sale for $575 and it hasn't failed me yet. I love the fact that it's unlocked so I could pretty much pop any sim card into it and have service. I really wanted it in orchid gray but the black was on sale for significantly cheaper (I believe the full price is about $750-800) so I stuck with that one. The battery life lasts me all day even through my heavy use. It hasn't died on me yet.
B06Y14T5YW,Ad,1,Went to connect the phone to MetroPCS and was told that the phone was reported stolen and they won¡¯t connect it.
B06Y14T5YW,amy crawford,3,The phone itself seems fine but when it arrived it was out of the packaging and the phone box was covered in scores/dents. Not quite sure what the deal is but it was unprofessional and makes me wonder if the phone is really new?
B06Y14T5YW,AMY Griffin,2,most breakable phone I have ever owned. Do not like Bixby & if you enable it other setting get jacked up. the edges make it difficult to hold without triggering certain apps unintentionally. I have never been so dissatisfied with a phone (this is the 3rd or 4th Galaxy I have invested in & I have LOVED the rest :-()
B06Y14T5YW,K. Hogan,5,I bought this phone for my husband as a Christmas present. He found it very easy to transition from his old S4 to this one (and he HATES change!!).
B06Y14T5YW,Vanessa,4,If you love Samsung you will love this phone. Battery life is amazing for a large screen. Display is mediocre (hence the four stars). Easy set up and use. Phone works as expected. Only phone I have found that actually works with Android auto.
B06Y14T5YW,Debby,5,"Of course since my old Samsung was an S5, it took a bit of learning. The phone it's self works great. While I hesitated because it was a refurb, it works as promised. Very pleased with it. Just wish I could have plugged it into my head and understood all it did. :)"
B06Y14T5YW,Randy,5,"Dope phone. I'm writing this review from it. I've had it for many months now without problems. I'm on AT&T. They activated it right in the store for free, took less than 5 minutes. Picture quality is phenomenal and the phone in general is just gorgeous to look at. I don't use a case or screen protector, just a pop socket, but I also don't drop my phone. I've heard the glass is fragile, so you should consider getting a case."
B06Y14T5YW,Tom Porter,2,"I am sure I would have liked this phone as I had done plenty of research before purchasing. The phone itself is fine however upon boot it appeared to be defaulted to Spanish. Not a good sign. The phone is touted to be an unlocked US version of the phone, however, this does not appear to be the case for the one I got. After changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (SM-G950F), I determined this one to be a European version. There is NO CDMA radio capability and Verizon fails to provision this phone on their network. A bit disappointed and returning."
B06Y14T5YW,Cc12,5,Works well with armor case. I applied with case on to get an exact fit. Bubbles disappeared within 2 days to leave a completely transparent voating.. So far protector has stayed on without issue for nine days. I like the texture and touch sensitivity is gone.
B06Y14T5YW,Ben,1,"the phone worked fine for about a month, but then got stuck in a boot loop. It stopped working completely less than a week out of the return window. Samsung support has done nothing and say to call a number that never picks up after 3+ hours. I am in no way happy, this is god awful service on a broken product."
B06Y14T5YW,Brittney,5,"So, like many of yall I was a little skeptical about buying a phone online. I've never done it before, however.. I have had it since Monday and it came in perfect condition, there was no scratches, no dings and the software runs perfectly. I just slipped my AT&T sim card into it and here we are. Lol, honestly, everything about this phone is so good, the camera quality is great, the battery lasts me ALL day and I constantly scroll through apps. The screen is big and bright so you can see everything you are reading and I love how thin and easy to hold the phone is. I 100% recommend this phone to anyone!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Lejla,5,"If you are hesitant about buying this phone, simple .. DONT BE. I love it. I really don't need to be writing 4 paragraphs to explain how great it is, you'll see as soon as you try it out. But yah anyways, I STRONGLY recommend.
Don't listen to negative reviews."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,The phone is great responds great the only problem and its why i decided to go with the S8 is that the VoLTE is not available. I checked before ordering even one of the reviews says it works but I cant get it to work at all. I decided to keep the phone because I am switching providers within the next few months and rather not buy another phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Mark Rocket,2,"S8 has a consistent and better, more intuitive user interface than prior models. Very good compatibility with common apps and applications. But for real, does the world really need another new device with a non standard plug? Yes, I am going to ding you -3 stars for that silliness."
B06Y14T5YW,RedBeard,5,"**CAVEAT EMPTOR** My phone and phone box were labelled with the wrong MEID number. When I called Sprint to activate, they told me it wasn't unlocked, so you can imagine my frustration. I finally figured out that if you dial *#06#, it will show you your phone's serial number, MEID #, and IMEI#, which turned out was different than what was on the box or the back of the phone. When I then called Sprint to activate with the actual number and my Sprint SIM card, and everything worked out fine.

As to the phone itself, it's great. The screen is nice and large, responsive, good speakers, I like the water resistant design, and the swag is great (comes with the charger w/ USB cable, a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone, and a set of headphones. One of the best things about this phone is that it has NONE of the bloatware that comes with Sprint phones that can't be disabled or turned off.

Overally, outside of the hassle, this is a great deal on a great phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Geno287,5,Took it to a Verizon store and everything went smooth. The Verizon employee asked me where I purchased the phone. When I told him I bought it off Amazon he said nice phone and that it was unlocked. A lot cheaper than buying from Verizon. Pleased with purchase so far.
B06Y14T5YW,RaeKhan,5,"Its been 6 months now, so i guess that makes me qualified to give a review. Amazing piece by Samsung, its fast, great color production on display, and a screen which is the best in the market. No issues with multitasking though it gets a lil slower if you open up 15-20 apps at a time, (that is bound to happen for any Android one which you buy). Love the latest Snapdragon, played a lot of graphic intensive games but it hasn't underperformed in any of them..Thanks to Amazon, happy with my buy. Will stay with me for years hopefully !"
B06Y14T5YW,Marquan Collins,4,Good phone. If you got the spare cash go for the s9 the dual speakers sound amazing.
B06Y14T5YW,Brendan Smith,3,"Was a decent phone until the burn in started to become noticable 6 months in. Now closer to a year the screen burn in is unbearable. Planned obsolescence at its finest.
Good antenna good battery. Bixby doesn't seem any more useful than google assitant."
B06Y14T5YW,Girald,4,"Almost like my nexus 6p better.. This phone does have wifi calling, something i use since i have poor mobile coverage where i live. It charges fast and does the trick... just wish Samsung would perfect the wifi to data crossovers better. seems like it gets hung up (no pun intended) on the change overs.... i have to airplane mode it more times than not"
B06Y14T5YW,DaveNBuster,5,"I bought this unlocked Galaxy S8 directly from Amazon - not a 3rd party seller. Brand new, all accessories in box as advertised. Brought it to Verizon and once we got a SIM card in it everything worked as it should. I don¡¯t have any Verizon bloatware on the phone (unlocked) which is a bonus. Huge upgrade from my old HTC Desire 816 in almost every aspect (though I have to admit the HTC had better stereo speakers). Amazon price was $180 less than Verizon for the same phone."
B06Y14T5YW,William D. Gray,5,"Great cellphone! It is well made and very easy to work with. If you can, get the S8 NOTE. I had one before this and I miss the NOTE. Nothing beats the NOTE in any category. I may take a $ loss and go back to/switch to the S8 NOTE."
B06Y14T5YW,Stinglikebee,2,"There are many issues with this phone.
1) battery drains extremely fast , even when not using it
2) cant download MMS even after restoring APN and other fixes
3) lost calls where phone doesn't ring and caller goes straight to voicemail
I have had other Samsung phones in past, but none this bad.
Would not recommend."
B06Y14T5YW,Meg Lance,5,"So very, very glad that I purchased this wonderful phone! I had a Galaxy S4 for two years before purchasing this phone. It will do so many things - just hope I can learn how to use several of its many functions. Using the phone is fantastic and the clarity of the calls is great!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,My son ordered one of these and had no problems with it. It worked on the Verizon network without a problem so I ordered one for myself. When I tried to activate it the Verizon Network said that it was not compatible with their network. So it depends on which one they send you if it will work or not and unfortunately you will not know until you get the phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Habahaba9,5,Listen to me right now when I say the S8 is a good phone. Holy crap its amazing super fast HD display this phone is beautiful! Mobile Internation LLC is a trustable place to buy your S8 look at the seller he sells new S8's with no lies or gimmicks. The S8 Got here in one-day I'm playing around with it currently and I'm sure it will gather a lot of attention. If I have any issues ill post them here. This is the type of phone you want to show off people.
B06Y14T5YW,Doug,1,"The phone is amazing but Samsung is still forcing Bixby on it's customers. If you don't know what Bixby is, it's a personal assistant created by Satan himself. It is the most infuriating piece of garbage ever and you have to jump threw a ton of hoops to suppress it in your phone, you can't actually remove it.

While the phone itself is amazing i would consider a pixel XL. Hell, after dealing with Bixby i wish i bought one !"
B06Y14T5YW,Grumble,4,"This is a pretty good phone and replaced a Moto X Pure. It's sleek and attractive. The hardware is beefy--64GB is more than enough for me. And if I did need more, it's nice that I have the option of using a micro SD card. The processor and ram have nice performance on apps. Some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera. Personally, I haven't had a problem with that. Nor have I had a problem with the Bixby button, although it seems unnecessary. The iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me. I'm just not using that function.

The deduction of a star comes in Samsung's software. It's not bad. But there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'Why won't you let me do ________? or why won't you let me remove _______ from MY PHONE?' For some people, that may be Bixby. Personally I'm using it in conjunction with Google Assistant and that seems to be working well. But for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it. Likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then Samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version. It was great that they included some apps with a new phone; I get that. But if I want to get rid of them in favor of something else, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops.

And then there are odd situations like Samsung's built in Game Tools. Now I'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times I'll mindlessly kill some time. But that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons. When I finally managed to kill the buttons, I was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game. It took a $2.50 purchase for an app called BK Disabler to finally get rid of it. It's not a lot in the scheme of things. But man, what an aggravating experience for an otherwise solid & great phone!"
B06Y14T5YW,Malthurian,4,"Things were good until the 30 day return window passed, then the phone refused to lock occasionally, and then refused to unlock occasionally."
B06Y14T5YW,anita,2,I loved it at 1st then the keyboard started giving me issues. Everything else is great but I have press really hard to type anything.
B06Y14T5YW,R. Schmidt,5,"Love the phone and the price. Unfortunately, I didn't see a link to getting an extended warranty. By the time I contacted the warranty company, for 30 day window had expired. No problems with phone yet, though, so, hopefully I just saved the money i would have spent on the warranty."
B06Y14T5YW,Reza,4,Galaxy S8 is a beautiful phone. I love the design and doesn't feel 'cheap' at all. The fact that you can use your own external storage (MicroSD) is awesome. Picture quality is great and the phone is fast. Does take a bit long to charge but the phone is absolutely beautiful.
B06Y14T5YW,Barbara Fenn,3,"Nothing wrong with this unlocked phone itself but it was not totally compatble with Verizon. Advanced calling features such as wifi calling, hd etc are not available. Also no 4g or 3g only lte. I do not recommend purchasing if you have verizon. Had to return phone and buy a phone with Verizon software."
B06Y14T5YW,anton,5,"Gorgeous phone. All glass. Fingerprint sensor location is not so bad as reviews indicate.
Disabling app power manager/optimize battery is a must for receiving notifications in timely manner. If you need just led notifications but no sound, you need to download and use silent.mp3 tone.
Bixby button not so scary since it can be remapped.
Looks frigile I would never use a case, so really hope I don't drop it.
Very nice deal at $460, thanks amazon!"
B06Y14T5YW,rachel miller,5,"This phone has been amazing so far, no issues and the battery last for quite awhile, anywhere from 8 to 12 hours or possibly more based on how often I decide to play games and text on my phone. The camera quality is beautiful and crisp and the option to filter out blue light is defently a plus since I stay on my phone before I go to sleep. I loved my LG G5 but this is my new baby."
B06Y14T5YW,DodgeEnthusiast,5,I purchased this as a surprise for my Wife as an upgrade to her existing S4. She was so surprised and happy when it was delivered. She has hardly When Wife is happy ... we're ALL happy!
B06Y14T5YW,donna m holland,1,The antenna stopped functioning after 3 months! Mighty expensive mistake. Warn everyone not to purchase!
B06Y14T5YW,Barbara Rose,1,"Ordered a new phone, says it will come unlocked. Was NOT new and definitely WAS NOT unlocked. Waste of time and money!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,M. Matthieu,5,"Such a great phone! After doing months of research, I wasn't sure which phone to choose. Pixel 2, LG V30, S8 or even iPhone. I finally decided the S8 has most everything I wanted. Wireless charging, great camera, decent battery and a perfect screen!

After a month, I am so happy with my decision! Wonderful phone, perfect!"
B06Y14T5YW,Orion,4,"Bought this version here directly from Amazon. So far so good.
For those wondering it does not have wi-fi calling. And although the item was bought here in the States and is the US Version, Samsung did not found the product's IMEI, therefore you can't register it at Samsung, so no warranty. I received a discount because of this."
B06Y14T5YW,Michelle Pawlak,5,"Have been using this phone for about a month now, really liking it. Upgraded to the S8 from an S5, so I definitely think the speed and everything is better on this phone. Haven't had any problems with the phone and am loving the larger screen."
B06Y14T5YW,LarryH,5,cant say enough of how much I love this phone ... best samsung so far ... and $200 less then t-mobile store for same phone
B06Y14T5YW,Michael J. Kramer,5,"Outstanding replacement for my old Samsung SII which started acting a little funny. Very clear screen, long battery life, and connects with the Bluetooth in all my vehicles in 8 seconds or less and never fails to connect."
B06Y14T5YW,Bristi,1,"Phone is fine. Works like a charm. But when you go and register the product, the warranty is already expired (By at least a year or a few months). We ordered a replacement model and the issue remains the same. Don't order."
B06Y14T5YW,Tadd Hooks,5,I absolutely love this phone. I made the switch from apple to android with the latest phone updates and it was the best decision I could have made. There are so many more things you can customize with the phone and it's settings it really makes it personal.
B06Y14T5YW,Don Trumpy,5,the planned obsolescence of my s5 finally got to me so I bought the s8+ works good - wonder how long they will allow me to use it before they slow it down.
B06Y14T5YW,Outspoken,5,"Excellent phone but not supported by Samsung.com since it is an international model, according to Samsung, with a US warranty. Samsung advises that there is only international phone support for mobile phones. Had I known that before ordering, I would not have ordered!"
B06Y14T5YW,Anthony H.,4,This is by far one of Samsung's best products switched from iPhone 7 and wow Apple needs to step their game up
B06Y14T5YW,Chris,1,"I ordered an unlocked phone to use with consumer cellular however this phone is Verizon locked , help."
B06Y14T5YW,Anne Marie,5,"Best cell phone I've had. The colors are vibrant, the camera's great not to mention lots of features. I haven't used bixby due to the reviews but I'm fine without it."
B06Y14T5YW,j-Overly,5,Exactly as described - unlocked and new in box. Some of the other reviews had me concerned this was going to be a refurb that was prior locked to a carrier. That was not the case. I followed the link direct from Samsung's website to this listing.
B06Y14T5YW,Soufpaw,5,"Love this phone, last one I had was back to note4. I recently had a Moto G4plus never again. Staying with Samsung. Didnât know much about purchasing a phone online so glad everything worked out well."
B06Y14T5YW,Fyren K.,2,"Beautiful. Runs fast. Worked well with a SIM card transfer on Verizon networks, instantly. Lots of neat features like running multiple windows.

Flimsiest thing I've ever seen.

I'd owned a Droid Turbo 2 for years that stood up to all kinds of abuse until the battery finally permanently died; This thing cannot stand up to common usage. It had a screen fracture in less than a week after a maybe two-three foot drop even with a case/screen protector on. If you can be rough on tech, avoid the hell out of this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Rye jay,4,"Phone came quick. Brand new. With ear buds, all the USB ports, charger, and a warranty card. It's only been a few days, but phone is working mint. Popped in my sim card and started working immediately. Idk why so many bad reviews honestly. It's a little confusing."
B06Y14T5YW,Sam,5,"I freaking love this phone. If you've done your research, and want a great android phone, you cannot go wrong here. And unlocked? If you're tired of Verizon bloatware, this is great so you don't have all of those random apps filling space."
B06Y14T5YW,Marc R.,3,Samsung android - you must protect yourself from Google. Comes with bloatware. This model cannot be easily rooted to get rid of the bloat.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,"I paid money for new one, but from this packaging, I don't feel this is the NEW one. The phone's protection membrane is intact, but I still highly doubt that this is a return product from other!"
B06Y14T5YW,Sean,5,"Still beautiful and nice compared to the latest smart phones like Galaxy S9 S9+ or note series
Compact, handy, and productive.
If you say this phone is not good, you yet don't know how to use it."
B06Y14T5YW,Sophia Jung,5,Galaxy is always right
B06Y14T5YW,meca,4,Nice memory great storage some new features great sound and pictures. The only thing I don't like is it does not have and I. R. can't use it as a remote for regular TV and other electronic devices. Like the s5 and s4. The permanent battery such too that will cost a lot of money to replace in the future.
B06Y14T5YW,Michael J Miller,1,Not the US that was advertised international version has no warranty
B06Y14T5YW,CuriousLlama,5,"registered with Samsung, got the warranty, everything works amazingly!"
B06Y14T5YW,Prime,5,Works with Verizon.
B06Y14T5YW,Hills Mountain Store,5,Much better phone than anything apple I have ever owned! It was either this or an LG!
B06Y14T5YW,Teddiann Raabe,5,"I had to buy a new sim card because my old one was too small, works perfectly with Straight Talk and had zero issues using it for the last month or so. I love this phone! It's so nice to hold, amazing picture quality, everything about it is so nice. (Just disable Bixby button on press and your good to go!) 10/10 would recommend."
B06Y14T5YW,Trill,5,I bought this phone for my son he really likes it we have been a Samsung family for years only way I would switch is if they quit making them. I don't know all the particulars on the S 8 but my son hasn't complained anything about it so that's a good sign
B06Y14T5YW,Darren Hoyt,5,"It came in very good conidition and works just like new! Worked perfectly with AT&T and it has flawless performance. If you just want an S8+ and don't care about a scratch on the glass back or a nick here and there, then you will absolutely love this. Nothing a case or skin can't fix anyways. Make sure to get this from 97% positive and up sellers though, don't take risks when buying products like these."
B06Y14T5YW,Ana Perez Balverdi,5,"This phone is the best! Love how it looks, how it works, and it's not heavy or big at all."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"Apparently Samsung changed the menus, on the open network unlocked phones like this one, and eliminated wireless calling and video calling from the menus. This is a problem that many people are having with this phone but Samsung refuses to provide a patch to fix the problem. Reviews talk about the phone being capable of wireless calling but for some reason Samsung changed the menu for this open network phone. You have to download third party apps like Freetone and Skype to use these features. Other than that the phone works well."
B06Y14T5YW,Billy Barnacky,3,"The product came in great condition for a used device, no problems at all with operation. The only problem is the LCD has burn in on the screen and this WAS NOT mentioned in the description of the device. I emailed customer support 5 days ago and no one responded so I'm just going to assume they don't care. The burn in is slight but enough to be an annoyance, hence the three stars. Would return except I would be without a phone which I use in my work so I guess I'm stuck."
B06Y14T5YW,A. Bullock,4,I've only had the phone for 2 full days so I'm still learning. But it is user friendly. I like the size and the different sounds. On my Blu phone though I could get text messages without having the data turned on. That would be the biggest thing that I do not like so far.
B06Y14T5YW,Thomas P. Taylor,3,I could not register the galaxy s8+ with Samsung. I called and gave Samsung support the information on the phone. It turns out I received the UK version. It can not be registered in the US. Temperatures are in Centigrade and I bet some distances are in kilometers.
B06Y14T5YW,John,4,"The phone is great, but Bixby is nonresponsive the majority of the time when trying to use voice wake up. I've gone through the setup multiple times, but it still doesn't work. Google assistant wakes up with no problem so it's not the mic or me. Also Bixby works fine with the (poorly placed) Bixby button."
B06Y14T5YW,AH,5,Accidently broke my phone and needed a replacement. This one works exactly like my last one and saved my self a couple 100 bucks. Compatible with sprint. Perfect new condition!
B06Y14T5YW,Lee Elkins,5,"Pros: This phone is not completely outdated as of yet and is still extremely functional and affordable. I had been an iPhone user for many years but their idea of trying to get people to upgrade by killing off the battery and making apps not work because a phone is 2 years old is ridiculous. I refuse to pay $1000 for a phone.

Cons: This is simply my opinion but it really has nothing to do with the phone itself. Getting used to working an Android OS again.

Alongside with Amazon payment plan, you cannot go wrong with this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Kevin,4,"Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.

Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did).

Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks."
B06Y14T5YW,Tony,5,I wanted to use the phone for a couple of weeks before reviewing the S8+. I upgraded from a S6 and I am not disappointed. The transition went seamlessly except the S8+ will not let you transfer pictures from texts. This is a known issue with this phone and I knew about it BEFORE I bought it. There is a workaround this that requires a Gmail account and it is simple to do. Other than that minor issue this phone ROCKS!!!!!!!
B06Y14T5YW,sharon chapko,5,"Just received my new phone in the mail! Looks real nice! Just found out that I have to have a sims card from Sprint (my service provider) in order to use it! Fortunately, they told me the sims card is free, and that I can either order one or go to the store and get it there! We shall see!"
B06Y14T5YW,Alexis Gipson,5,"So far so good as a replacement phone for the Amazon Fire Phone I've had for 4 years. Working out the details of learning it, I have not tried to register yet to ensure a warranty was available It arrived timely and looked brand new."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"This phone has been amazing! I purchased it when it was roughly $550. Retail price was $850 with T-Mobile (ridiculous)! Overall the phone has worked amazing. Only complaint is that the screen protectors for this phone (purchased separately) makes it super hard to type.

Overall, love this phone!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,A.S.,5,"I switched from an iPhone. Took a day to get used to Android and then I just felt free. The phone is light and thin with excellent screen real estate, fingerprint scanner, and a great camera. I was able to move my SIM card directly to this phone without any interaction with my carrier or their website. Samsung also provides a Smart Switch app that transferred most of my content to the new phone via USB cable. The phone comes with an adapter so you can just use your iPhone cord if you have one."

Broken charging port. Ripped off. No relief from Samsung or Amazon."
B06Y14T5YW,Luis R.,5,"I have had my share of cell phones and this is the Rolls Royce of them all. Arrived nicely packed and connecting it was easier than expected. This came with Oreo 8.0 already installed. 5 STARS all the way around!!
I simply love it"
B06Y14T5YW,PY,4,"Ever since changing from iPhone to a Samsung phone, I have never been happier. Now my whole family uses Samsung phones, from Galaxy s7 to s9+. My kiddo really like this s7, which is an upgrade from the Note 5."
B06Y14T5YW,TyCris,5,"Phone works great so far. I didn't realize it came with a screen protector installed on it so I kinda freaked out when I thought the phone was delivered with a crack all the way down the middle. But I figured it out a couple days later, removed the protector and boom, perfect screen."
B06Y14T5YW,Ziggy Tzavorite,5,"Ordered phone, received it, took it to my local sprint store. They swapped out 2 phones I had on our Sprint Plan, sold me sim cards for $2.99, transferred all the info from old phones to new phones and we are extremely pleased with the whole process. We had never purchased an ""Unlocked Phone"" and we did not have any problem using the phones on Sprint."
B06Y14T5YW,Tony,4,Came in time and was exactly what the website description said it was. Didn't get a brick or a box of socks so Im pleased.
B06Y14T5YW,diego n.,4,Great phone. Seller should specify exact model number. Mine is SM-G950U1
B06Y14T5YW,Learsi,5,Love it...it works on my verizon sim card as well as wth my sim card from the Philippines..the camera is so clear..thanks amazon for fast and safe shipping
B06Y14T5YW,Josue Garcia,5,"Got this for my brother as a reward for a great school year. Paired with a case, this phone is the amazing for it's price. Holds up well on his end for gaming. On my own GS8 I have outstanding battery life and it's optimization tool just adds on to the great experience.
Maximum Power Saving Mode is customizable allowing you to add compatible apps to it and manage things like brightness and CPU performance.

No complaints here"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Came very fast! Works fine, registered with Samsung and it had the software to sync with my old phone. I just put the Verizon sim card into the new one, turned it on and bam new phone. It's that easy"
B06Y14T5YW,Lorine R. Nolte,4,"I like the phone very much. Would recommend it to others. Light weight, easy to use even for a person of my advanced years. I do wish the punctuation marks like the question and exclamation marks were on the main keyboard. I am hearing impaired and don't use the audio at all so I can't speak to that. The picture quality is excellent and it's easy to navigate."
B06Y14T5YW,Jay P.,5,"Phone speaks for itself. Only way to go if buying upfront - equal payments, no interest and priced right!"
B06Y14T5YW,Stroke4,5,"I bought an open box return. It was just like new. I like the size of the phone. It's a little bit longer but, it is thinner. That makes it easier to hold. It came unlocked and I was able to get it on my cell phone provider's network without any problems or surprises."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Bought this phone the other day as a replacement for a Samsung On5 phone that only had 8GB memory but worked ok just slow. Just wanted to have something better with more memory and a unlocked version. This phone seems to have some great features which I'm still exploring. The display and camera is awesome! A little pricey but in the ballpark with other competitors brands/prices. Very happy so far.
B06Y14T5YW,Charles Beck,5,"My wife and I needed to update our phones; we both had the Samsung Galaxy S5. After reading reviews and assessing our usage and needs, we found the S8 to be the best choice. After receiving our phones, we were up and running thanks to our service provider's online ""chat"" feature. The chat attendants were knowledgeable, patient and immensely helpful. I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8 to others and Verizon Wireless."
B06Y14T5YW,Lou,3,"Beautiful phone, however if you use Page Plus this device will not work. I have bought 2 phone off amazon and 1 off Ebay trying to take the cheap rout, but I am going to have to just buy this particular phone off the Page Plus website. I hope this review helps fellow Page Plus users."
B06Y14T5YW,Justin D.,5,"Omg this is everything I want in a phone! It's super quick, battery lasts forever, lots of room, it really is unlocked. I took it to Verizon and it works just fine. Only I saved a couple hundred dollars and didn't get Verizon's bloatware."
B06Y14T5YW,Kaylah Kislan,5,"I purchased this unlocked galaxy s8 sold by Amazon and I couldn't be more pleased with the phone. Truly unlocked. The phone came with all of its accessories- charging adapter, headphones, etc. It arrived when it was expected(Thanks 2 day shipping) and with no issues at all!
As far as use, I love everything about this phone. Camera quality is great compared to the phone I was coming from. The phone fits perfectly in my small hands. Overall, could not ask for anything else!"
B06Y14T5YW,Guion Lucile,5,"I don't like that phones nowadays have to be huge but I guess that's what it is. I had to get a new one because my S5 kept breaking. This is one is really good though, I'm happy I went ahead and got it."
B06Y14T5YW,Papass,5,"Read reviews and various positive comment ... all are true and useful for decision making! One bit lower, keyboard only English .. that is unfortunate, should have a version with 2 languages and more with predictable and dictionary features available!"
B06Y14T5YW,D. Pimentel,5,"This device works perfectly as advertised. Don't let the naysayers prevent you from buying this based upon the false notion it won't work with Verizon, because all that was needed was entering the IMEI code, which is listed on its back, into the Verizon website to order the necessary and free SIM card."
B06Y14T5YW,Rosa,5,Perfect. I' m very happy with my new Samsung it's new. I love it.
B06Y14T5YW,justin pettiss,5,This is the nicest phone I've ever had. I was worried buying something this expensive from somewhere other than the manufacturer but it arrived on time and in the original box. Was a breeze setting up and the resolution is absolutely amazing
B06Y14T5YW,Mike N.,5,"I love every aspects of this phone.
Highest equality materials; camera, screen, processors, and everything.
Well implemented software based on the top class computing power runs this phone seamlessly in any situation.
Battery is well managed by optimization tools so that during idle time this phone seems to don't use any battery."
B06Y14T5YW,Jianna K.,4,I got this on black friday and had the deal. Since then it is okay. I however am a klutsy person so I dropped it myself. I didnt buy a screen protector because my brother whos a tech wiz said I dont need it but I now have a crack through the camera lense. Other than that I love this phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Pictorico,5,"Awesome phone! It's beautiful, technically advanced, responsive and did not bring too much bloatware. I'v always had Galaxy S phones and this is the best."
B06Y14T5YW,Danny,1,"I don't normally write reviews but I must say this was an extremely disappointing product. The seller clearly advertised this BRAND NEW phone as having a USA warranty and could be used in the US. The phone was bought internationally, making it unusable and not covered under Samsung warranty. Very unhappy and extremely annoyed at being lied to. Product was also not sealed as the ""sealing"" sticker used for the product box was missing as if the phone was switched from the correct device."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"I purchased this phone at the october 23 and I have in my hands now and is a incredible phone.
I've been a little bit worry because my purchase is a Verizon unblocked phone, you know for the CDMA theme but the CDMA the phone is both CDMA AND the GSM NETWORK so I only put it the metro pcs sim and the mtropcs girl do it her magic and work very well and fast. Of course I paid for the new SIM and $15 dollars to fee"
B06Y14T5YW,Greg Robinson,5,"The best phone at any price right now. I'm looking forward to next year when I may go for the Samsung Note. I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development. He's no Steve Jobs, not by a long shot... This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack. Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack. With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda. Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it. Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth headsets allow the companies to track you differently. Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing. I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits. Samsung did it, but these other companies can't? Got to be more to it."
B06Y14T5YW,Javier,5,Very awesome phone. I don't think I have nothing else to say. Good design.
B06Y14T5YW,diane,5,"I love this phone, so many extras, so much fun and great pics. I have been a Samsung fan for years fourth galaxy phone and each is more impressive than the last. This is out of the park. Between camera, bixby, and battery life phone is wonderful."
B06Y14T5YW,e123,4,"I was unable to register this product in my Samsung product web. It's IMEI or so number was not accepted, unlike order Samsung Galaxy phones from another supplier, why?"
B06Y14T5YW,VINCENT M MUSI,5,"I JUST RECEIVED MY UNLOCKED GALAXY S8 TODAY FROM AMAZON. WENT TO VERIZON AFTER WORK AND HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL GETTING IT ACTIVATED.. IT TOOK LESS TIME TO ACTIVATE THAN IT DID STANDING IN LINE . COST ME $10.00 FOR THE SIM CARD. I'VE READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS WHERE PEOPLE HAD A HARD TIME AT VERIZON..THAT WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE AT ALL ! IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS PHONE UNLOCKED I SAY DO IT !! AND I PURCHASED THE UNLOCKED VERSION, NOT THE VERIZON UNLOCKED AND NOT A PROBLEM ! HAPPY CUSTOMER AMAZON !"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"Item received on time. After a couple of days of use the speakers did not work anymore. The device has been restoring media for several days with a current recovery progress of 11% (73 MB out of 656 MB), the wireless charger stops working continuously and the Wi-Fi connection also stops working with no reason. I have been out of country for a month and for this reason return time was closed."
B06Y14T5YW,Matt Foster,5,"Seriously LOVE this phone. It is my companion, and I fall in love with it every time I take a picture in nature. I live in a small valley, and I've never been more able to capture the beauty of it than with this phone. If you are on the fence, get off and run (do not walk) to buy this phone. Don't pay over a grand on competition (cough cough ""X"") when this phone is absolutely INCREDIBLE at almost half the cost. I could go on and on... But seriously, I love this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"Great deal on a flagship phone without needing to worry about the carrier bloatware. I was pleasantly surprised that the ""used"" phone I purchased is basically brand new besides some fairly faint scratches on the screen. Had no issues powering the device on out of the box, and it even came with a complimentary case.

This is only receiving a star less because the USB C cable that shipped with it was broken on arrival. Not a big deal, but a bit of a headache when you need to charge the phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Jan,5,"I like the S8, replaces an S3. Lots to figure out, but not much difference. I have not figured out how to set message tone for contacts. Other than that all good."
B06Y14T5YW,Marce,5,I was skeptical ordering a phone online specially from a small company with few reviews. The phone was new no damage visible to the box. It works fine with At&t and I'm happy with my purchase
B06Y14T5YW,DYANNE WAGNER,5,"It was a gift for my husband, he loves it!!
I have the LG 30 and he has the S8 the 2 top phones of 2017. Out of the box, he had 8.0. REMEMBER FOLKS, FORBES
MAG. RATED THE S8 & THE LG 30 AS TOP ANDROIDS FOR 2017. HIS REVIEWS GO FAR BEYOND. THE APPEARANCE . I ALWAYS GO BY THEM.
WITH MY S6 ,OK I HAD 12 MODELS , THEN I GOTA GREAT ONE! BUT, IF YOU BUY FROM SAMSUNG, GREAT PHONE, SHORT ON CONSUMER SERVICE. KNOW YOUR FACTS N REASEARCH!!! DONT
WINE.BE HAPPY!ð"
B06Y14T5YW,Tyler R.,2,"3rd month with phone and its progressivly gotten worse. Phone does not come with all features of normal s8 plus such as wifi calling, as well as some camera features. It also drops random calls, as well as won't let people call you randomly. Spend your money elsewhere"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"The phone had all the qualities that you would look for in a basic phone, but being a total novice I did not recognized a major flaw. My phone will not transmit a message. I did not noticed until I took the phone to T-Mobile, and asked them why my friends were not receiving my messages. This part of my phone does not work. Where do I go from here?"
B06Y14T5YW,RENATA,5,"I love my new phone!! I was apprehensive about buying an unlocked phone but it was brand new out of the box, I took it down to my local Sprint store and they set it up for me, free of charge as well. I'm now trying to get my husband to upgrade his phone as well."
B06Y14T5YW,Luke,5,"This is a quality phone, its fast, it has expandavle storage and it was created this year and is one of the cheaper flagships and although I prefer Google assistant bixby does a good job at what it was designed to do. Bixby can download apps for you if you are to lazy to type and that is basically all I use it for, otherwise Google assistant all the way."
B06Y14T5YW,Joshua Aucker,1,I have Verizon and they said that this wasn't an Unlocked phone. I am returning this.
B06Y14T5YW,Araceli Bejarano,5,Works great was worried that it wouldn't but in posting this review on my new phone!!!
B06Y14T5YW,MurFam12,5,This phone is great. I was able to save money because the price is less than what straight talk wanted for full retail. Was able to activate on straight talk with no problems.
B06Y14T5YW,Gsyk59,5,"I just upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to this Galaxy S8+. What a nice phone. Love the bigger screen and the battery. Battery lasts forever. I choose this phone over the S9+ because it is the same size phone, has the same size battery but costs about $300 less than the S9+. Only difference is the S9 has the 2 lens camera on back and the S8 has the 1 lens camera. Besides that, everything else seems the same. Picture quality on this phone is still excellent."
B06Y14T5YW,B. Wright,5,"Love this phone. Not the biggest but after putting a Temdan ALL proof case on it, I wouldn't want the S8+. It would just big too big...and I'm 6'4"" with huge hands."
B06Y14T5YW,Heydez,2,MMS will not work. Talked to AT&T and they said its the phone. I called Samsung and they said I should call AT&T.
B06Y14T5YW,D. Gibson,1,I bought this phone because it was a US phone. Unfortunately this is an international phone and is not usable. This is the first item I have had to return from Amazon. Hope it goes smoothly because it was an expensive piece of worthless to me equipment.
B06Y14T5YW,Mark Fitzsimmons,4,"I moved from an iPhone 6 to the Samsung S8 because of the recurring battery issues. The first thing I noticed about the Samsung S8 is the significantly longer battery life. The phone is not as user-friendly as the iPhone, but that might be more a function of having been a longtime iPhone user (my learning curve). The phone looks great, comes with a lot of great apps and is relatively easy to set up. There are some quirks that will take some time to get used to, but that's probably true for any new phone. Overall it's a great phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Marilyn Winters,5,I love everything about this phone. Bixby is my favorite which is the equivalent of siri. By far the best phone I have owned or used.
B06Y14T5YW,Zane Hitchcox,1,"So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.

""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.

So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now."
B06Y14T5YW,Tahlia,2,Every day I have to restart the phone at once to be able to use it. It keeps advising that I have no network registered when I do....it is frustrating at times
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"The screen is a great size, it runs fast, its slick and sleek. And now Samsung has finally allowed you to disable the Bixby button! Texting is oddly very slow but I can live with that."
B06Y14T5YW,John T.,5,Too smart for me absolutely great phone
B06Y14T5YW,Julia,5,Perfect. Love this phone so so much.
B06Y14T5YW,Fidel A. Torrealba V,5,"If you have the money, go for it. High performances, great pictures, good battery life, and comes with some useful Samsung software on top of the native android.

The only drawback, is that battery optimization is so good, that prevent application like Strava from running properly by blocking its background access to resources.! So, if you are planning to use Strava, have a second thought. Still it deserves 5 stars."
B06Y14T5YW,bradburrito,5,Purchased this phone for my wife and she couldn't be happier. Happy wife happy life
B06Y14T5YW,Rose D.,5,"He loves it! Will get one for myself...hopefully, before my current phone has a ""seizure"" and stops working"
B06Y14T5YW,L.E.S.NYC,5,Great Phone! I went and turned it on at Metro PCS with out a hitch . I did not try to do the warranty yet but otherwise this is a great phone for the price
B06Y14T5YW,Sarah,1,"I chose this provider because I wanted an unlocked phone from a Samsung official provider that was advertised as being from the USA. I live overseas and it was important that I be able to use the phone in the USA and abroad. Not only was the phone not unlocked, it was also made or sourced? from Germany, so it was unable to be unlocked. Buyer beware! This is NOT a trustworthy source!"
B06Y14T5YW,Ricardo Rosales,5,"Amazing product!

the only downside that i can tell about this phone is the localiton of the fingerprint sensor."
B06Y14T5YW,Micah Nichols,5,I LIKE IT ! never had this new an fancy before LOL only thing I don't like is no voicemail notification. I don't know if its because it not a Verizon phone which is who I have as a carrier or what ? Also I had to go to a Verizon store to activate they will say it wont work for Verizon but if you keep on them or find a tech sales person who is willing to try an not just say no they can push it threw or whatever they do just takes a little doing on there part but it will work on Verizon
B06Y14T5YW,jen,5,"Fairly intuitive features, good size/weight, and thankfully Bixby can be turned off. (Disclaimer: I probably was easy to please since my previous phone was an S4.)"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,I really love this phone it's pretty fast great for some emulating gaming I may get it activated with Metro by tmobile got this as a upgrade from my S7 I will give it 9/10 base on the condition has a few scratches on screen but that's expected because it was used .
B06Y14T5YW,DanFourth,3,"Beware: While this is a nice phone, it does NOT allow Wifi calling on the Verizon network, which is essential for me. That's apparently something that's only available if you buy Verizon's version of the phone, which, ridiculously, costs $160 more. Otherwise, the phone is as advertised and setup was convenient. Unfortunately, I'm going to need to return the phone because the absence of the Wifi calling feature."
B06Y14T5YW,StoneHenge,4,Too many stupid initialization pop ups that keep happening as new things are opened and used. Too many things already turned on for notifications for evaluate businesses and apps. Otherwise it's great
B06Y14T5YW,Mee,5,"Love love love it! I replaced a Samsung J3 from AT&T with this this high end S8. The J3 just didn't have what it takes to operate the WIFI in my new apartment building ""fortress"". The Amazon price for this
unlocked S8 cannot be beat - $300 less than anywhere else! As directed by AT&T I only had to insert the Sim card from my J7 and it was good to go instantly! I couldn't be happier with my unlocked S8 at this spectacular Amazon Prime price!"
B06Y14T5YW,Nick,5,"Great price for a flagship phone, upgraded from Google Pixel and love the screen on this phone. Best phone I've ever owned."
B06Y14T5YW,Pietro Dolcimascolo,5,"Great phone, amazing picture quality and battery life. Smooth processor and operating system. Amazed."
B06Y14T5YW,bridgett,5,"I enjoy it, been almost a year of use now and still works really well despite drops, etc."
B06Y14T5YW,Nat,1,The one that was sent to me did not operate well and the camera was subpar
B06Y14T5YW,Matt reedy,5,"So far I am very please with this phone. Shipping, packaging, quality are all great."
B06Y14T5YW,Madison,5,"Absolutely loving my galaxy!!! It's fast, and very convenient. Beautiful display and great graphics."
B06Y14T5YW,mrpapercuts,1,"The phone stopped charging within a month, now Samsung won't fix it even though it's still under warranty and is saying i need to pay them $640 to get it fixed (wrote screen damaged which is not true the screen worked fine)"
B06Y14T5YW,DamianLC,5,Love my s8 best phone I've ever had hands down! They have awesome customer service when it comes to buying this phone from Amazon my first phone sent out to me had a camera and screen issue but after talking to Amazon about it I was sent a replacement right away.
B06Y14T5YW,Francisco Baeza,5,"Great product at a great price during Black Friday, and was able to use my Citi points.
It looks and feels small, but the display is amazing.
I also bought Maxboost Galaxy S8 Case mSnap and the ArmorSuit - Galaxy S8 MilitaryShield and both work perfect for the phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Emiy,5,"I had the s5 and this upgrade is making my life complete! I got this on cyber Monday so Im super happy with the price I paid! Delivery was on time with no delays, faster than expected. I have had the phone about 2 weeks now and I love it. My SIM card on my s5 was way too big, so I just went to the Verizon store and told them I upgraded - SIM card was $10 and I was outa there in 20 mins, they took care of setting it up too."
B06Y14T5YW,Rhett Reynolds,5,"S7 Edge screen broke so I picked this up and preferred the size/feel over the plus. What an awesome device, incredible how quickly we move on to the ""next best thing"" this phone is still A+! Download Nova Launcher and you have the finest phone on the market"
B06Y14T5YW,Mike H,1,"Im sure the S8 is a great phone, but I ordered from Amazon Warehouse ""like new"" and the back cover was not even glued on correctly and was already coming off during unboxing. It was a great price, but quality control is obviously lacking here. Returning immediately."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Got a new SIM card from my carrier and was instantly up and running. Very happy with the phone, face recognition is better than I expected. Phone is very fast. Battery life has been awesome."
B06Y14T5YW,Roger Hinman,5,Second unlocked S8+ that I have bought. This is an excellent product. Great security and plenty of speed and storage.
B06Y14T5YW,M. G. Tatum,5,"love this phone ! great storage , great pictures , great sound , quality build and feel, and i found it on Amazon at a great price !"
B06Y14T5YW,Jacob,5,"When I got this I was really afraid how it's going to be, but so far it's working great, really enjoying it,"
B06Y14T5YW,Theresa Hill,5,Great phone! Worked perfectly from the moment it was turned on. No issues connecting to Verizon at all. Came with needed accessories including the data switch connector and a connector to use my old charger.
B06Y14T5YW,Kyle Wynn,5,"HTC one, and ASUS zenfone 3 user. The quality of the phone, looks, apps, security iris scanner. Battery life functions features. Best phone I ever had. Fits perfect in hand if you like a good regular phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Kalilah A Enriquez,3,Great phone overall but I was disappointed because the heart rate sensor on mine doesn't work. This is a feature in S Health that I used often on my S6 Edge
B06Y14T5YW,Cynthia Astle,5,This phone replaced a Galaxy S-III. There are some differences to get used to and I wish voice mail was a bit more intuitive.
B06Y14T5YW,CantelopeHead,5,"Best phone I've ever owned. Screen is beautiful. Camera excellent. And yes, it had an FM antenna not requiring WiFi or mobile data to hear local FM stations. Samsung apps are excellent great improvements over stock Android."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,Very good battery life! Front-facing camera could be better though...
B06Y14T5YW,Denise Huerta,1,Phone wasnât even unlocked
B06Y14T5YW,Elodie,5,"I had Samsung and Iphone and I know now that it will be Samsung and only Samsung. Very good product, easy to use."
B06Y14T5YW,Jimmie J LeRoy Jr,5,As described and arrived quickly. It was exactly as described and works great. I use cricket and had no problem connecting myself.
B06Y14T5YW,Aries,5,"Great phone, just a bit pricey. I guess you do get what you pay for."
B06Y14T5YW,Alexis Fox,5,Switched from an iPhone to this and I couldn't be happier. The customization display alone is worth it because I do lots of photo editing and the space I have for everything is amazing! I feel like I'll never even be able to use all 64 GB
B06Y14T5YW,Erik Christian Stenquist,5,"Couldn't be more pleased. This phone has surpassed all my expectations. Well all except poor Bixby. That one was a disappointment. But the screen, oh THE SCREEN! Just won't quit! Love love love!"
B06Y14T5YW,PDox,4,Phone looks and works great! The only problem is that Boost Mobile could not activate it due to carrier technology incompatibility. This phone does NOT work with Boost. She had to switch carriers.
B06Y14T5YW,Joseph W H,5,Beautiful device. Fits a little smaller in hand vs previous Galaxy and runs just as smooth. Aesthetically pleasing and the slightly larger screen is gorgeous. All black themes look so nice with this. Would 10/10 buy again
B06Y14T5YW,Steve,5,The best phone available. Just wish Samsung would drop the Bixby stuff. Also Samsung does not believe in cutting edge Android so it is running an older version than my old phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Adam L. Horst,5,"Great phone, lots of features that going from a budget phone to something this advanced has kind of floored me on its capabilities and camera quality. Order from a trusted seller and you're golden, all I had to do was pop out my old sim card, do a quick transfer of settings and contacts and I was done without ever stepping in a phone store."
B06Y14T5YW,Chrysleanne,5,I did a major upgrade with this purchase. It is sleek and thin. The screen curves on the edges which was scary but after 3 days I'm used to it now. The battery life is top notch. Played music at work through it for 8 hours and it got down to 78 percent. The pictures are amazing and crystal clear. This is the best phone purchase I've made.
B06Y14T5YW,D. Welb,5,"I got an S8 after seeing it get top rankings in Consumer Reports

amazing phone, it's a beast, can do anything you throw at it.

anyone wondering if you get a ""real"" S8, yeah you do, I checked it with apps that see whether it's new or used, and it is factory new."
B06Y14T5YW,Mo,5,For me the phone is similar to my Galaxy S7 but the smart design of the infinite screen is the best use of space. I also like the freedom of being able to use another carrier when I'm ready.
B06Y14T5YW,Oscar B,5,Working as expected .. so far.
B06Y14T5YW,Onur SENTÃRK,5,"I live in Turkey. Bought this, sent it over to a friend in the US.
It works fine with my carrier here. The packing was new, everything came out of the package as expected (charger, earphones, etc)
Just a reminder, if you are going to use it somewhere else, do not forget to buy yourself a plug adapter, since the one that comes out of the box is the US plug.
Handsome phone.. loved it"
B06Y14T5YW,Colorado,1,"Great hardware but two things that make it terrible. Software especially phone dailer is terrible compared to stock android. You have to have a separate app just to check your voicemail with the S8 vs a Pixel where it is included with the dailer and a breeze to use. It may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time. Also that bixby thing is terrible. They won't let you turn it off without a Samsung account that they use to track you. It pops all the time but after a while you figure out how to get it to stop saying ""hello, this bixby"" and then you learn how to get it stopped right away. Once again a big waste of time but at least it becomes less of a pain. But really, why put up with any pain when this phone costs over $600? Skip it, keep your old phone if it still works or buy something else."
B06Y14T5YW,A Monkeys Uncle,5,Love this phone. I was a little unsure about the curved screen at first but it I actually love the look and feel of it now. Upgraded from an s5 and the difference is amazing.
B06Y14T5YW,Mary Wise,5,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it! It was easy to set up - he was able to transfer all his data, contacts, etc from his old phone very easily. The only thing we had to do was visit a Sprint store to get it properly activated with a new SIM card, but that was easy and free, even on the day after Christmas."
B06Y14T5YW,yuan,5,"Great product, fast, stylish. The only thing I complained is that the text on the phone edge is somewhat warped. We are using AT&T cellular service and the phone works well."
B06Y14T5YW,nightequinox,3,Neutral. Froze a lot. Had lag. Might be an individual issue. I did a lot of research about the phone and saw common complaints. I was really not happy with the purchase but deemed that it could have been an issue with the individual phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Virgil,5,Paid for a used damaged package Samsung 8 And received a Brand new Samsung 8 unused and untouched.I have absolute perfect 4GLTE service with cricket wireless Since I got this device .Best $400 I've ever spent
B06Y14T5YW,Melodie Joy,5,I could NOT be more happy. This is where I will buy all my devices from here on out.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Amazing phone, been using it for 6 months and has no lag whatsoever. Never crashed once. Dropped our multiple times with and without cover never broke or cracked."
B06Y14T5YW,softochreprincess,5,this phone is my new best friend and I dont need any human friends anymore because this little contraption is wonderful
B06Y14T5YW,John Campbell,5,Great phone. Still learning the Android way. Finely gave up on Windows 10 Mobile.
B06Y14T5YW,J.Franco,5,Excellent condition as described. Unlocked model so there's no bloatware. I'm happy with this purchase.
B06Y14T5YW,Mark D.,5,"This phone has met all my expectations with room to spare. Touch is very easy to use, great colors and screen clarity. The camera is great with an impressive zoom. Would reccomend this phone to all."
B06Y14T5YW,Kerrith H. King,5,A pleasure to use. Holds a charge noticeably longer and charges noticeably faster.
B06Y14T5YW,SAS EXEC,5,"This phone is great. Large screen, excellent camera, and a good value. Best phone I have ever owned."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Upgrade from a 6 year old S3 and the S8 works great. Sound quality is good and reception seems improved.
B06Y14T5YW,Emilio Carrillo Jr.,3,"Phone appears to be great. However, I'm missing the ear buds, and phone charger and cable . I would like amazon to send those missing items, so I can use the phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Daryl B.,5,Work great in us with t mobile. Just popped in my sim and it worked. Has 4glte and the fm radio feature is great.
B06Y14T5YW,cj,5,love the phone how fast it works had little problem registering with Samsung but all good now
B06Y14T5YW,diane l.,5,I love this Samsung galaxy S8 plus phone. I went through 4 Samsung galaxy Mega phones in the last year 1/2. They would freeze up and move slow. I thought I was saving money but in actually I wasn't.
B06Y14T5YW,User R,5,Bought as a gift for my elderly father. Works much better than the LG4 and without issue.
B06Y14T5YW,A. Chavez,5,Best phone I've ever owned very fast great screen and sound just awsome.
B06Y14T5YW,Gingerfer,5,Great phone. Great battery life. LOVE that it still has an earphone jack.
B06Y14T5YW,kg,5,Original S8+ .....good quality headphone akg... everything described in the box was there....Was a bit concerned with negative reviews but I had no problems
B06Y14T5YW,Louie the Looper,2,"Phone, new ,works ok- But It advertise W/US Warranty - nope not happening, when log on to Samsung tell you it not for USA distribution. False, advertisement. This is an unaccepable practice."
B06Y14T5YW,NPZ,5,"This is best experience of all the smart phones I have tried yet and I have tried all from iPhone 3s,Nokia Lumia till iphone 7 and many more in the mix."
B06Y14T5YW,Oscar,5,"This phone is amazing. Pretty much all I can say for now considering it's just my first week. And for those curious, yes , this can be activated on MetroPCS. The process took about 2 minutes."
B06Y14T5YW,Kevin,5,I used to have a windows phone now I have this I Am glad I upgraded
B06Y14T5YW,Justin A,5,"Quick delivery. Phone was as expected and no issues with it at all. Samsung makes great phones.

B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"Samsung Galaxy s8+ is a very good phone. My review is all about the description, it says unlocked, I tried to use it with boost Mobile and it didn't work, I try online, by phone, and in the store. Going to return it to Amazon"
B06Y14T5YW,steven le,1,That what receive in the mail .
B06Y14T5YW,Kindle Customer,5,Just the right size: not to large to hold easily and not too small to have to strain to see. All the bells and whistles I'll need for awhile!
B06Y14T5YW,Lucas,5,"The phone is amazing and the delivery was really fast!
The phone arrived in perfections conditions.
Galaxy 8 is a beautiful cell phone and the camera can take some gorgeous pictures.
I would definitely recommend it."

B06Y14T5YW,busymom,5,LOVE THIS PHONE SO MUCH. Got to me fast and was easy to set up.Price cheaper then other places.
B06Y14T5YW,Marilyn Winters,5,I love everything about this phone. Bixby is my favorite which is the equivalent of siri. By far the best phone I have owned or used.
B06Y14T5YW,Zane Hitchcox,1,"So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.

""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.

So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now."
B06Y14T5YW,Tahlia,2,Every day I have to restart the phone at once to be able to use it. It keeps advising that I have no network registered when I do....it is frustrating at times
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"The screen is a great size, it runs fast, its slick and sleek. And now Samsung has finally allowed you to disable the Bixby button! Texting is oddly very slow but I can live with that."
B06Y14T5YW,John T.,5,Too smart for me absolutely great phone
B06Y14T5YW,Julia,5,Perfect. Love this phone so so much.
B06Y14T5YW,Fidel A. Torrealba V,5,"If you have the money, go for it. High performances, great pictures, good battery life, and comes with some useful Samsung software on top of the native android.

The only drawback, is that battery optimization is so good, that prevent application like Strava from running properly by blocking its background access to resources.! So, if you are planning to use Strava, have a second thought. Still it deserves 5 stars."
B06Y14T5YW,bradburrito,5,Purchased this phone for my wife and she couldn't be happier. Happy wife happy life
B06Y14T5YW,MICHELLE,5,Love this phone! Everything I expected and more. And amazon is amazing!!! I had problems with the first one and they sent another one out quickly. The return was super easy. Glad I bought this phone from amazon.
B06Y14T5YW,seema sony,5,My daughter she got gift on her birthday she loves her phone .
B06Y14T5YW,Suanne B.,5,Just love it! Takes great pictures and with a straight talk sim card works great!
B06Y14T5YW,Hai N. Nguyen,5,I bought this for my son. He had Iphone before but he said this one is better.
B06Y14T5YW,Daniel Wolfe,5,Took a bit to get use to but its been amazing.
B06Y14T5YW,Karan,4,Does not have the original lamination and the packaging is a little different. i have bought bought 3 s8+ and a note 8 so I know.
B06Y14T5YW,Sherry,5,I am still learning from a 6 to an 8 now they have the 9 out geesh... picture quality if awesome
B06Y14T5YW,Alf33,5,Good deal. Super phone...and a great update from S4. Battery life is very nice.
B06Y14T5YW,bellsAmazon Customer,4,Nice phone. Switched from iPhone because it's a more open system and allows user to make choices but with that said it is not as intuitive as the iPhone. I also like Suri much better.
B06Y14T5YW,T. Edwards,5,Perfect condition and extremely happy with purchase. The wife loves it
B06Y14T5YW,Miguel Alvarez,1,r button wasnât working after a less than a week of usage.
B06Y14T5YW,Tom,5,Super good phone made the switch from apple just in time. Buying it off amazon will still save a few hundred bucks opposed to getting it on a plan through carrier because the carriers total price is higher. So if you want a new phone and can to pay up front save some money and get this one.
B06Y14T5YW,Arturo,5,I bought this phone 6months ago and it still works great! I have changed different service providers and have had no problems like I've had with proprietary phones from the companies.
B06Y14T5YW,J.R. Bryan,5,"So far, so good, this phone does so much more then I would have imagined, as well as things I never could imagine. Its way smarted then I am."
B06Y14T5YW,Pratik Agrawal,5,"Awesome phone!!!
Pros:
Amazing (super amazing) display
awesome aesthetics (the phone is very sleek)
lightweight
Cons:
Awkward position for a fingerprint sensor.
I heard screen breaks pretty easily (I ordered screen protector and a case for this phone, although my earlier phones didn't require one)"
B06Y14T5YW,Former computer socket design engineer,1,"This was hacked and charged to me, I'm deaf and don't use one!"
B06Y14T5YW,Lonnell H.,5,The improved battery life is a welcome change. I can find no issues with this phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Jee,5,"Don't be scared to buy this phone. This will work with Verizon. I went to a local store and the dumb sales girls gave me a dirty look and said it won't work. I asked her to still try. She typed some numbers and told me it's not working. So I just bought a sim card from them and called Verizon customer support. The lady that was on the phone got mine to work with in 10-15 mins.

So if you are worried that this might not work with Verizon, don't be scared. It works. Just buy a new sim card and call the customer support instead of going into a store."
B06Y14T5YW,Gladys O,1,"phone was not brand new as advertised even though I paid for a brand new phone, sim card tray was defective on arrival, I had to buy a new one, battery began to inflate after 3 months, cost me $150 to replace battery. Now, I cannot answer incoming calls or call someone except is is on speaker. It was a scam, I was sold a used defective phone"
B06Y14T5YW,notoriousew,4,Awesome phone except the bixby button.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,Been using for about 6months. I always like Samsung products in general. Its good
B06Y14T5YW,Greggy,5,Love the phone. No useless Verizon apps. Great price!
B06Y14T5YW,Force10JC,5,"Please know that my phone previous to this was a Droid Razr Max XT912. After owning this new Samsung Galaxy S8 for a couple weeks now, there really is no comparison to my old phone. It's almost like going from a black and white 13"" TV with rabbit ear antennas to a 39"" HD flat screen with high speed cable. I only mention this to offer perspective in the event some feel I have over fluffed this product in my review.

The phone arrived precisely as advertised. Neatly boxed with instructions, corded head-set, charger with USB adapter fittings, and Sim/SD card remover tool. Upon removal from the box I could find no flaws or blemishes. It started right up and had a 50% charge on the battery. I was immediately able to connect it to my high speed home wifi. Afterwards, I just browsed a bit on the internet to get a feel for it and immediately noticed that it was insanely faster than my previous phone but the biggest glaring difference was the clarity and crispness of the display.

Not wanting to tempt fate, I forced myself to stop playing with it long enough to get it in a protector case and apply a glass protector to the face. Even with the glass protector, there was no noticeable difference in the display. The sound was very sharp as well.

I played around with it a bit more but then had to run over to the Verizon store to get them to put a SIM card in it since I already had a service plan with them. Once I got there, it literally took 5 minutes for a Verizon representative to find my account and put a new SIM card in the phone. After that it was a simple restart and I was full connected. After I returned home I was able to download all of my previous content from the Verizon cloud using my high speed wifi. After that it was business as usual except now it was faster, cleaner, sharper, and just all-around better than that old Droid Razr Max.

I admit though that I can't bring myself to ditch Google voice for Bixby. I have heard from many that Bixby doesn't compare so I haven't tried it. If there is an issue with the phone it is that I sometimes accidently enable Bixby with an inadvertent swipe in the wrong direction or tap of the button on the bottom left side. I will eventually try it out an update this review later.

After having the phone a couple of weeks now, I am still extremely please with this phone. I've had no performance issues whatsoever. Navigating through the net, apps, settings, etc. is quite painless. Photos are very clear even with my unsteady hands. I will update this review with anything I feel is worthy later. Good or bad. Right now I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for one."
B06Y14T5YW,ymd,5,No issues and takes even nicer photos than my last phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Patricia,5,"Like it, still learning how to make use of all the options."
B06Y14T5YW,Sarah,5,Product came like new with no issues! Easily activated at the Verizon store. I'll update this review later with more details about the phone itself.
B06Y14T5YW,Krista Hayes,5,"After 3 years I had to upgrade from an S6 and the S8 is great. Love all the newer features, unlock with face, and endless customization settings. Picture/sound all great."
B06Y14T5YW,Carol Harris,5,Great price and I love my Samsung!! I will purchase online again!
B06Y14T5YW,Andy,3,"Great Phone, fast, Good battery life.
However my hand will touch the edges when being use.
For the price it was ok."
B06Y14T5YW,Kristine Sue Heeg,5,Works great and everything that I was looking for
B06Y14T5YW,kgb,4,Cannot get Verizon voice mail or Family Base to work on this phone. Verizon says there is no way to add these services! Wish this had been clear in the description before I purchased. I have found NO VOICE MAIL APP that will work on this phone!
B06Y14T5YW,S. Beck,5,I ordered two phones. Product delivered as advertised and on time. I had no problem activating them to my service provider.
B06Y14T5YW,Liz R.,5,I love this phone. It takes great pictures.
B06Y14T5YW,bbew32,5,Love the size and picture quality. Do not like the Bixby key that that you are unable to disabled unless you create a Samsung account
B06Y14T5YW,sam zhang,5,Good enough function and performance for the price you paid.
B06Y14T5YW,Cheryl Terry,5,"I love this phone, it is so nice and easy to use. Perfect screen size , I just love it"

B06Y14T5YW,Garilyn Franci,5,"Easy to operate, a little to big to carry in my pocket. Love the finger print scanner to unlock phone and other secure applications"
B06Y14T5YW,T.V,1,Worst phone ever. Samsung is worst service. Do not buy this/Samsung products. Software updates ruin the phone and due to purchasing via Amazon the service isn't good. It's US Warranty phone but doesn't cover the same as a store bought or direct Samsung bought. Bought it 3 months ago and still suffering with a non functional phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Ace Ess,3,"The phone is good, but the charger stopped working after some months!"

B06Y14T5YW,Aries,5,"Great phone, just a bit pricey. I guess you do get what you pay for."
B06Y14T5YW,Alexis Fox,5,Switched from an iPhone to this and I couldn't be happier. The customization display alone is worth it because I do lots of photo editing and the space I have for everything is amazing! I feel like I'll never even be able to use all 64 GB
B06Y14T5YW,Erik Christian Stenquist,5,"Couldn't be more pleased. This phone has surpassed all my expectations. Well all except poor Bixby. That one was a disappointment. But the screen, oh THE SCREEN! Just won't quit! Love love love!"
B06Y14T5YW,PDox,4,Phone looks and works great! The only problem is that Boost Mobile could not activate it due to carrier technology incompatibility. This phone does NOT work with Boost. She had to switch carriers.
B06Y14T5YW,Joseph W H,5,Beautiful device. Fits a little smaller in hand vs previous Galaxy and runs just as smooth. Aesthetically pleasing and the slightly larger screen is gorgeous. All black themes look so nice with this. Would 10/10 buy again
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"Great screen , lots more memory than my old phone, very fast processor. Love it!"
B06Y14T5YW,Saurabh Maiti,5,Great Battery compared to previous versions. Sound it send to different speakers/headphones vary.
B06Y14T5YW,Shane Ferrick,5,"It works. I got it for Sprint. I went to the Sprint store because they needed to use a different SIM card, but it was done for free."
B06Y14T5YW,Donna Bishop,5,"I love this phone so much! Best picture quality I've ever had, and loving the wireless charger. The setup is easy to use and I'm enjoying the Samsung benefits"
B06Y14T5YW,Marilla Williams,5,Great quality for a great price. Very satisfied with my purcahse
B06Y14T5YW,cody,4,Easily the best android device released in 2017. A few software quirks and slow updates keep it from 5 stars.
B06Y14T5YW,David Schrader,5,"Phone works on Verizon, girl in the store was surprised. Great phone!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,everythings was fine. Its a good seller.

B06Y14T5YW,kerdisha,5,Perfect...... I was kind of sceptical about it because of the bad comments but thank goodness I didn't take them on and I ordered it.
B06Y14T5YW,Tim Jirrels,5,Great phone. Switched from iOS to Android and love it. This phone has all the specs of an iphone plus more. The display is absolutely amazing. Can't go wrong with the galaxy line of phones.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Great product for a great price!
B06Y14T5YW,Aracely Hernandez,5,"I purchased this phone for my wife as a Christmas gift, she is absolutely loving it! It works perfectly, and has amazing features; I'm honestly a little bit jealous, haha.

B06Y14T5YW,kim,5,Really nice phone i have dropped twice without cover while i was waiting for my cover and has had no damage. Plus really nice camara default down fault censor botton is net to camara but i will get use to it
B06Y14T5YW,Fernanda Nakamura,5,"Fast, good looking, good size, long battery, good sound, great camera, huge storage, never brakes. Didn't activated Bixby, however."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Pros:
- gorgeous display ( seriously you will fall in love with this bezeless beauty)
- So many helpful and useful features that I never knew I wanted/needed
- Insane battery life
- Unlimited customization options
- More storage than you'll ever need, plus sd slot in case you somehow need more
- The list goes on and on

Cons: (Small things but worth noting)
- Dedicated ""Bixby"" button is annoying if accidentally pressed
- Slick (can be fixed with skin or case)
- Fingerprint sensor is in kind of a weird spot (especially for left-handed users)

All in all every second of using this phone had been an absolute pleasure!"
B06Y14T5YW,Cuz I'm A Nerd,3,"Great looking new phone, however my model was apparently special edition and could NOT be activated to my boost service"
B06Y14T5YW,Doug Horner,5,"You'll probably have to activate it yourself because Verizon personnel seem to be ignorant about what to do with these. Luckily it is very easy to do. Love, love, love this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Terry S.,1,"This phone was packaged as new, but could not be registered to our CDMA carrier because it remained in contract with Verizon. Completely unusable to us."
B06Y14T5YW,charlesb,5,No bloatware. Allot of memory for more stuff. Not slow at all. Excellent way to transfer your stuff from other phone. Love it. I'm in IT support.
B06Y14T5YW,John,4,"Works fine, accurate description, no complaints!"

B06Y14T5YW,Austin D.,5,"Everything is amazing about this phone. Camera, Android Oreo update, and features. Very similar to the Galaxy s9. Unfortunately I had to return the phone due to it not being compatible with my phone carrier. I would recommend purchasing but make sure it is compatible with your carrier before buying."
B06Y14T5YW,Celeste Barreto,5,The best phone I have ever used... great battery life... beautiful screen just love my s8 plus.... only thing is have to keep it fragile as the body is all beautiful glass.. rest everything is deluce

B06Y14T5YW,Wayne Dziubinski,5,My Galaxy S3 was getting 'tired' and slow. Bought this S8 the same week that Samsung announced the S9 and got a heck of a deal on Amazon as retailers wanted to clear their inventories of S8's. VERY nice phone with lots of features I'm still learning about
B06Y14T5YW,Judith,3,some features I don't like (Bixby button too easily activated)

B06Y14T5YW,Peter,5,Works perfect
B06Y14T5YW,PApsDad,5,"I have read a lot on this phone and the reviews do not give it justice, on an unlock phone I had no problem going through Verizon to get a SIM's card (my Galaxy Note 4 had a larger card. They did have to go to the 800 service to acknowledge the phone but it was up and running in no time. I do recommend a LifeProof case (Fre) it makes it water proof for those who do not want to scratch the screen it's warranty is great. This phone is fast and I was able to transfer all of my apps with Samsung smart switch app easy as pie. If any cons show up I will update this review."

B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"You wonder why I chose a 1-star rating? Well, well well...one day after getting it, turning it on, installing some apps from my old phone, getting a new sim card, and finally using it...I encountered an unrecoverable black screen of death. I tried every button combination I could find, and nothing worked.I watched the black-screen happen too...and it was charged. Now I'm up at 3am writing a review for something I now need a refund of."
B06Y14T5YW,Maheswar Vayugandla,5,Great Phone. Purchased from Amazon and using it from 2 weeks with no issues. I was able to use the phone with my desired carrier and able to register the phone successfully on Samsung website.

B06Y14T5YW,Madhumitha C Reddy,5,Excellent phone. Should have switched from my iPhone long time back.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,In screen burn on AMOLED was mentioned on product description. What was mentioned was full functionality but where the burn in is located doesn't always registrator. Will not being buying again from this supplier.

B06Y14T5YW,AmdBtr,3,The curved edges make it very hard for screen protectors to be installed!!
B06Y14T5YW,Seasoned Seamtress,1,"Samsung S8 should be named the Kim Kardashian selfie phone. This phone came with bloatware that cannot be turn off. Especially irritating is the automatic selfie application that kicks in frequently when you're getting ready to capture an important camera shot. There seems to be no solution to turning off the selfie mode application. If there is, please let me know. Not worth the money.."

B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Great
B06Y14T5YW,Mr. Tropical,5,"Hope I can cut through all the confusion posted here about Verizon compatibility. THIS MODEL DOES INDEED WORK ON VERIZON'S NETWORK. When I received the phone, I charged it to 100%, but did NOT turn it on. I then took it to a Verizon store. After a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, Verizon has been ""refusing to activate unlocked phones"" not purchased through them. However, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a SIM card and activated my new S8. Be persistent!

Awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too! Everything is working great. It is nice to own a phone without all the bloatware pre-installed."
B06Y14T5YW,Amy Zheng,3,too small for men hand.

B06Y14T5YW,Spencer,5,I've been loving the phone. Haven't had an issue yet.
B06Y14T5YW,W. Howington,3,"First off, from a hardware viewpoint this is an amazing handset. Stunning screen, sleek lines, all the sensors you would ever need, and some of the richest blacks I have seen from an AMOLED screen. Then ... Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won't let you disable. I literally JUST wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless I updated to a new Samsung Themes market where they try and sell you themes. I just want to change the wallpaper for pete's sake!

And the Bixby key? So many people don't want your Bixby key, plus Bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen. So Samsung adds the option to disable the Bixby key ... ONLY if you jump through all the hoops, creating a Samsung account, and letting them into every aspect of your phone. Nonsense. Just another data mining exercise. Then there is the Oreo update. I pay a premium for an Unlocked, from Samsung, handset ... then Verizon and T-mobile handsets get the update first. Really Samsung?? You're so far behind that the telcoms are beating you on major OS updates? A 200.00 Xaomi MI is a recognized Android One phone and gets the newest stuff immediately, but my 700.00 Samsung is months late? Seriously? If that is the case, then offer me a 50.00 USD plan to nix the special software nonsense and give me a stock Android experience. No Bixby, no 300 Samsung apps that I'll never use, and no locking my phone down to what YOU want me to do in an effort to mine my software.

This will honestly be my last Samsung phone ... if I wanted a locked down experience I'd buy an iPhone. There is a very good reason why companies like Oneplus, Xaomi and Essential are getting a chunk of the market share, they are giving the customer what they want. A quality handset that isn't hobbled by software and apps they don't want and can't disable.

At this point, I plan to see what the Oreo experience brings (if they ever get the freaking thing released) and unless they give us some control over the Bixby button and the option to use Google Assistant like it was designed, I'll sell this junk and buy a Oneplus 6. At least then I won't be controlled by a company, being told what I can and cannot do on a device that I bought and paid for. Frankly, there should be a law that Unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn't able to be disabled. I bought it, it's mine, don't tell me how to use it."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,I upgraded from a galaxy mega 2 to the galaxy S8 plus. And this phone is amazing. Amazon got it here in less than 48 hours and the price was right! Thanks Amazon

B06Y14T5YW,Jonathan,5,Best phone I've ever owned!
B06Y14T5YW,James C.,3,"The screen, camera, and overall build are phenomenal.

The Samsung version of Android is complete crap. The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious.

One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it.

If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it."

B06Y14T5YW,Scott Johnson,1,"Yah it's a cool phone where the screen goes around the edge of the phone and the camera is nice, but do you like to use Snapchat or the internet? Do you like to download apps then go on wifi? Well with this phone you can't do any of those things. Don't believe me? Google it there are plenty of forums that say there are no fixes for these problems. A more recent problem I've discovered is if you're listening to music the music will just stop playing until you unplug and replug the headphones in."
B06Y14T5YW,Johnny,5,New like I ordered but was tmobile not unlocked
B06Y14T5YW,Martin,5,I like the phone but the side button for bixy is kinda annoying I don't know how to use

B06Y14T5YW,Felicia Wright,2,"Unfortunately this phone, when activated with Verizon Wireless, is not capable of utilizing the Advanced Calling Features. This includes video calling and is very disappointing for me. I have another S8 work phone purchased from Verizon and the advanced calling works well. Verizon technicians have attempted to resolve and thus far have been unsuccessful. I would have rather paid additional money and had all the features available to me. The phone works fine otherwise, but this issue leaves me very disappointed with this purchase."
B06Y14T5YW,Sandeep,3,"I received the phone with open packaging. There was no seal on the phone and protective thin film on the phone packaging was also missing.
It seems like I received the phone returned by someone else."

B06Y14T5YW,M. Powers,5,"Verizon employee at corporate store stated the phone was not compatible when I brought it in for activation and they scanned the model code on the back. However, when they tried taking the SIM card from my Droid Razr Maxx and plugged it in, it worked like a charm on Verizon network. Have been using it for days and love it. Strongly recommend a case for protection."

B06Y14T5YW,Yulia,1,"Hi
I was buying clean phone ,
But I got previous verizon phone .
The phone is not compatible with T-Mobile.
When I returned the phone I needed also to pay for return .
In general
I wasted my time and also my money.
Very unhappy."
B06Y14T5YW,Simon Park,3,"I have been a IPhone user for some years but got feed up with the prices Apple charges. so I went with Samsung, The camera is very good the screen quality is great. the reason I only give it 3 stars is the edge screen is very easy to touch and easily changes things just by holding the phone.A few things that bug me might have to do with user control. For example having different sounds for different apps,Facebook,messanger,emails and so on does not seem to work or at least I have not made it happen. At the moment I seem to get a ring or ding but then when I go to check my phone I have nothing showing I have missed a message. Again this could be me so if I can figure this phone out I will happily update my review."

B06Y14T5YW,Tanmay Pandhe,5,Its awesome.
B06Y14T5YW,Buyer of Things,3,"This is a great phone. It does most of what it's supposed to and is a huge upgrade from my S6. Took one star away since it advertises use of the fingerprint scanner as a means to take pictures with the front facing camera. It doesn't work. I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely.

Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method). Still happy with my choice, but 3 stars seems appropriate."

B06Y14T5YW,Thi51Guy,5,"Bought this used from HTownGadgets and I'm very very happy with it.

The shipping was faster than expected, and the phone is in better condition than expected.

Everything was transferred easily from my Galaxy S5, and I had no problem with setup through AT&T. Phone is smooth and just what I wanted from the Galaxy S8.

The only thing really making this phone differ from a new one is the battery life. It's still miles above what I was getting on my S5, but it does die faster than it would if it was new (which is to be expected).

B06Y14T5YW,Carlos,5,"Fantastic phone. I haven't own a Galaxy phone since the S3. I went to iPhone and now I'm back on Galaxy and oh boy this phone is great. There are so many features on this phone that it would take me hours to explain them all in detail. They are great. From wireless charging, fast charging, the Iris scanner, and the gorgeous display. The screen has Gorilla Glass 5 and it's not easy to ruin with scratches. Be careful with buying screen protectors though with a case because thanks to the edges, cases will lift up the screen protectors from the bottom so you will need to find screen protectors that are case compatible. That was only problem I suppose that i've had so far. Otherwise, the phone is amazing and you won't be disappointed."

B06Y14T5YW,JAMAL c.,4,ok so far
B06Y14T5YW,Amy,1,"This phone has great capabilities and sleek design. Even though I purchased the Otterbox screen protector, I couldn't put it on and have the phone still work. As a result, when my phone was accidentally knocked off a stand that was about 18 inches off the floor, the screen cracked. Now I'm getting flashing lights and I will have to replace the screen for $230. I've owned the phone for less than 4 months and it is already almost useless because of the crack that keeps spreading and the flashing light. This phone is extremely fragile and for the price, definitely not worth it."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,There is nothing I can complain about.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed.

Cons
1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed)
2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried.
3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen)
4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement.
5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future.

Pros - (most other flagships are equal here)
1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining.
2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps.
3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices.
4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too.

In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display. I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.

Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,
1. I can get a flat display again
2. Take the buttons off the screen.
3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Great phone, great deal!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,AtilaM,5,I'm happy with my new cell phone
B06Y14T5YW,Julian the Apostate,1,"This was the worst purchase I can recall making. Run, don't walk, away from this thing. The Android platform is what it is, and if you're looking in this space you are already OK with it vis a vis the IPhone. The real problem is the casing. It is absurdly delicate, and the screen is so configured that it presents a fragile curved glass edge rather than a hard plastic rim. While this feature no doubt increases screen capacity, it means that there is a very high likelihood you will break the screen with ordinary use. To this day I'm not sure how I broke mine. Once you do that, you are in a world of pain. You can't get screens from Samsung as an end user, and if you go through an approved repair facility you are in for a wait of a month or so, and a total cost to repair of roughly half of what you paid for the phone. Meanwhile, you don't have a phone. Handy. If I could go back in time and pay money to avoid making the mistake of getting this thing, I would gladly do it. As it stands, I am probably going to write it off and get an IPhone, from which I mistakenly switched in the first place."
B06Y14T5YW,Michael A Meade,5,"Update: New phone has arrived and is working great. Five starts for Amazon customer service, 4 stars for the phone(the first one was defective but if not for that, would be five stars)

Like the phone while its working, seems to be quick and the pictures seem really nice, I'm unfortunately one of the ones that have been affected by the constant restarting problem. Two stars for now since Amazon customer service is replacing it, once the new one gets here and it doesnt have the restarting problem(restarts at random 15-20 times a day) I'll update the score/review."
B06Y14T5YW,Oscar,5,the best phone I ever had.
B06Y14T5YW,Hunter Bolte,4,"It really is a beautiful phone, and probably in the best family of phones out there.

The Good:
It looks amazing on the back and the screen. The curved display is very nice and only adds to the looks of the phone. The camera is epic and surprises me at every corner. The processing power is of course epic. Being able to record your heartrate, stress level and blood O2 level is nice.

The Bad:
For some reason you cannot change the notification sound, which is simply dumb. And you also cannot change what is on your lock screen, such as removing the clock, which is restricting.

What I recommend is that if you want a new-ish phone, and don't want to play an absurd amount of money, watch the price of this phone until it is around 470$ and then buy it."

B06Y14T5YW,Upper Left Coast,4,"Nice size, getting used to it's function. Just a bit different from my Windows phone, which was very easy to use, just very buggie after the recent OS update. Nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. Imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. Google got it right with their Pixel 2. Aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the S8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. READ the reviews for cases and accessories. Some really suck."

B06Y14T5YW,Zac,5,Recently switched from and iPhone 7 to the s8+. Bought from this merchant and I am very very pleased with the phone. It came it today and there was not 1 single scratch anywhere on the phone. It looks brand new! Would highly recommend this merchant!
B06Y14T5YW,X. Keels,5,"I really love this phone. Best phone ever, hands down. Very well made and constructed"
B06Y14T5YW,MI.KO,1,"1. I was using it fine. One day failed to start. 2. Sent in for repair on 8/18/18. 3. Just got it back on 8/31/18. 4. Samsung did not fix it. The letter came with the phone said simply, ""unable to fix"" 5. Called Samsung. Was on hold for 32 min. After several transfers, I was told there was a liquid damage. 6. How can there be a liquid damage when it never went near water? 7. Isn't Samsung Galaxy S8 water resistant to begin with? 8. It took Samsung over 10 days to determine that there is a water damage? 9. I have had many Samsung products in the past. I have to confess it will take a lot for me to consider Samsung again."
B06Y14T5YW,newz junkie,1,"Received this phone 3 days ago, and finally got the SIM card from VZN. Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts. Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out. 2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts.

Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is:
-The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment. Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone.
Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera. Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around.

So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner. If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere.

I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time). Returning this POS."
B06Y14T5YW,Mel,1,Slowest phone on wifi I have EVER used! It's not the wifi either because my husband's Galaxy s6 edge runs on the wifi in our house perfectly. EVERY other phone is fine. This one is so slow I give up and stop using it. I hate it. Everything else about this phone is great.
B06Y14T5YW,Simon,3,"Here is the thing, the phone works fine and I am really happy with the S8. However, when it arrived there was no seal on the box, and after I completed the install I noticed that it was already associated with another email account. The original protective stickers were attached, so it seems more like it was returned by the previous owner, but it is really inappropriate to sell a used phone as new."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Boss!!!
B06Y14T5YW,D. Ellis,5,"I love it. It's a decent step up from my previous Galaxy (S6 Edge Plus). The placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe (next to the camera lens... really?) but the awesome retina scanner makes up for it. I've read some say the retina scanner ""takes too long"", but mine unlocks consistently in under a second.

This is a deceptively tough phone, but you'll want a case as it's pretty darn sleek."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,Receive a box with the ear phone and a little black thing.. Phone was not in the package.. Disappointed
B06Y14T5YW,Zack,3,"For some reason even after I do the initial setup on this phone, webpages will default to Chinese for a moment and websites that use location won't be able to verify my location. All of my settings are set to the US, GPS is always on and I still have these issues. I feel since Amazon lets a lot of knockoffs in their store that this could be one of them. Still preforms decent, aside from that, but very skeptical."
B06Y14T5YW,Silvana Longaretti,1,The phone was sold to me as 'new' but it experienced Black Screen of Death from which I was not able to recover immediately after installing.
B06Y14T5YW,Mike,5,Why was I so loyal to the iPhone for so long? The Galaxy makes the iPhone look like a toy that you would give to a small child to keep them busy. I love this phone... Every aspect of it blows Apple away... I even went to the Apple store to check out the iPhone X - side by side the Galaxy still looks 10 times better.. I love it. Customization... Removable memory. The best phone on the planet.
B06Y14T5YW,Jezzy's Mom,3,Samsung and Google are competing on my phone on whose software to use. I LOVED my S5 so easy to use but now every little thing is a chore. I have to decide to use Samsung or Google software for everything! I wish I had known Samsung decided on this version to become more of a software company and push more than the last few phones to dominate over Google. The phone itself is beautiful.
B06Y14T5YW,M. Anderson,1,"I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed.

The positives:

1. The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging.
2. The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers.
3. The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege.
4. The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones.

The negatives:

1. No hard button on the front. I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button. I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you. It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place. That tactile feedback is missing on this phone. Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN. That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen. That's just stupid.

2. No user replaceable battery. This is simply inexcusable. I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary. There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user. It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover. Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery. I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery.

3. Oddly sized: This phone is too tall and too narrow. As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well.

4. Oddly shaped: The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets. Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image. In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges. It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped.

5. Bixby Button: Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri. There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button. Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button. But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account. Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button. Again, this is stupid. If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it. Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so.

In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead."
B06Y14T5YW,Natafoo,2,"The phone itself is fine. But because it's an unlocked phone, Verizon does not allow wifi calling. I have no service a work. And will not notify you if there is voicemail in your inbox. Instead you have to call your voicemail every day to make sure you didn't miss anything. Driving me CRAZY. So I say it's not worth it, and to go get your locked phone from your service provider provider."
B06Y14T5YW,JLL,3,"This phone is not fully featured like the phones sold by the wireless companies here in the U.S. It's usable. however, if you want all the bells and whistles, this isn't the phone. If you are happy with less, this phone fine. It wasn't until set up, missing features were noticed. An example, a landscape option for viewing or texting."
B06Y14T5YW,Just a Mom,1,"KNOWN ISSUES WITH TEXTING - read the Samsung forums before buying this phone. I sent my 2 month old phone in for repair when it stopped sending texts after a security update, and it was supposedly repaired but is still not working! Tech support and Sales pointed fingers at one another and have given me the runaround and refused a refund. Hard to believe Samsung hasn't improved their customer support after the S7 debacle. So far I've wasted hundreds of dollars on a paperweight and hours of my time on the phone with Samsung. Buy a reliable but inexpensive Moto G5 plus instead if you require texting capabilities on your phone!"
B06Y14T5YW,Spencer,1,"There is NO IR Blaster!!!! Seriously, why this hardware was not included in the S8 is beyond me. Rediculous! This hardware has been included in cellphones for YEARSSS and has been included in Samsung Galaxy cellphones since the S4!!! Smh. This was not a feature I thought I needed to research. I have utilized the IR blaster in all my previous cellphones to control electronics at work and at home, TVs and Air Conditions mostly, and I am incredibly disappointed to find out, after buying an S8, that it is not built into this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,J.,1,"This is my first ever written review, I was so dissatisfied I was compelled to write. I feel completely scammed and mislead by mention of the Warranty. I went to register my S8+ product with Samsung and was rejected. I attempted to register using the S/N then IMEI. REJECTED BOTH. I would have been much more satisfied with a Chinese phone for a much cheaper price with ZERO Warranty. I purchased this phone ONLY for the promise of some form of warranty. WRONG. NOTHING. Where does one go now?"
B06Y14T5YW,John,1,"Would give 0 if I could! Received phone, all it does is reboot constantly, before I was able to even set it up! Cannot get past wifi screen without it rebooting. Samsung is of no help. Reading online, this issue has existed for 8 months and they are still shipping defective phones without a fix. I will be returning this POS, and will get an iPhone instead. Shame on you Samsung!"
B06Y14T5YW,BrianShows,5,"It's a nice phone only problem I have is the HD Voice, WiFi Calling, and VoLTE(Voice over LTE) (the feature that allows you to use data and Voice at the same time doesn't work) but I love it I'm hoping this will change when I receive my replacement unit but I love it! And I love Amazon! They have really impressed me! Kudos to Samsung and Amazon!"
B06Y14T5YW,Brian,4,Does a perfect cell phone even exist? This phone has some little annoying things about it. Nothing too major I can think of right now. One is the ugly emojis. I liked the ones on my old Droid way better.

B06Y14T5YW,Ninako,4,"The Galaxy itself is fantastic. I love the picture quality, which is most important to me. Apps and customization are also fantastic. Another really important feature to me, as a data hoarder, is the SD card slot.

B06Y14T5YW,hunter27,2,So many bugs on my phone.Everytime I lock the home bar below it unlocks itself after a few days.Besides that this is the first galaxy I've had that's tripping balls in the software for many things.
B06Y14T5YW,Mostafa,2,"The ""fast charger"" charges very slow. My old S6 charges faster than this. Also the headphone quality is very low. It cuts off if you move it a certain way. Other than that the phone works very well."
B06Y14T5YW,@242,5,"I love this phhone.
It works perfectly on both my local service provider here in the bahamas."
B06Y14T5YW,DiamondPilot,3,"Despite reviews, the camera is not very good. Specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the HDR feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to ""real"" HDR where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.

When shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. When shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the HDR mode on.

My 2014 iPhone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real HDR that works well.

I even tried a 3rd party true HDR camera app. But, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. Basically, the camera's hardware just doesn't have the range to do it.

Also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether I use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. Streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.

I am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iPhones. In fact, my iPhone 4S has a preferable camera in some ways because it does HDR properly.

The 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iPhone 6 plus. There is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. While it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.

And the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 Apple model. This is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.

And, the S8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. I couldn't get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.

Lastly, while the OLED screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. I found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.

The phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than I expected. The front facing camera the best I've yet seen. The cellular reception is slightly better than my old phone - i will get 1 bar in some places where I used to get ""no service.""

Good phone all in all, but the camera flaws are a dealbreaker for me."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,Was sent a defective device that only worked for a few months. So disappointed in this product especially with how expensive it was. Wont be buying any Samsung products ever again.

I only had service and availability to use my calls, text, internet and google maps about 20-25% of the 9 day road trip i was just on. That's HORRIBLE. My boyfriend only lost service a couple times when we were in the middle of a national forest (where you expect not to have service). I haven't even used this phone for a year."
B06Y14T5YW,akshay bharat shah,1,"bought it 3 months before, suddenly phone stopped working. There is this famous black screen issue with samsung galaxy s8,
think before making purchase"
B06Y14T5YW,Curtis,5,"Love the phone! Currently in Europe and works flawlessly with Orange. When I get back to the states I'll have an updated review for my provider there. Came in box with charger, headphones SIM card pusher out thingy, and adaptors for micro usb connections."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"This is really a great phone, there's not 1 thing I don't like!"
B06Y14T5YW,Eugene J.,1,I loved the phone but after 3 months of use I have now the black screen of death. I tried everything online to repair it but nothing worked I felt like i had been had. I had to go back to my old iphone 6 plus horrible purchase.
B06Y14T5YW,jeff leopold,4,Yes works with Verizon wireless!
B06Y14T5YW,alex,1,"Big mistake you cannot connect to Verizon, Sprint, or Boost. The phone is unlocked but does not work with certain carriers which really make the phone pointless making you switch companies just to get the phone to work. Are we allowed to return this to amazon??!! US Version my ass!!"
B06Y14T5YW,dj,3,Too much junk on the phone
B06Y14T5YW,Aaron G.,1,"The telephone was supposed to be brand new but came with a syndrome of glitches. I can't move the apps around on the screen, it freezes like a four-year-old device and fails to work like a new Samsung should. I very much regret buying this."
B06Y14T5YW,McKinley,5,You can't go wrong!
B06Y14T5YW,Jose Armando Zamudio Barrera,1,"Well, screen cracked with just one week and a half old. Just one fall. Unable to use it anymore. I feel disappointed and angry about how cellphone business has become. Sell fragile devices and charge a fortune for a replacement. Around $300, because basically the phone is a single unit, so they have to change almost everything, even the battery (because of their exploding batteries history, they must replace it) You get what you pay for? doesn't apply here."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Just as described!
B06Y14T5YW,MoMo,1,"I have used androids for many years now. I was not impressed with this phone at all. Visual Voicemail would not work, talk to text never worked and I would have to constantly reboot to get it to work only to have it go out after a couple messages. Would not work with call recorder or other voice recorder. It would record some messages and some messages it would not. all of the Samsung bloatware was just way too much as well. Simply not impressed."
B06Y14T5YW,Mike,5,Returned it because it doesn't have wifi calling and that's the only reason I bought it. It's a great phone just spend the extra money at the carrier's store and wifi calling works.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Love my new phone. It is taking me a while to learn to navigate everything on it.
B06Y14T5YW,vanessa,1,The phone was used not new like they advertise and it didn't work on my Sprint account
B06Y14T5YW,JB,1,if you a want Access Basic Visual Voicemail thru verizon don't get this phone cuz you wont get any notifications
B06Y14T5YW,DennisVS,4,"Great phone, amazing display. Sometimes Iâve lags, but without influence on performance."
B06Y14T5YW,Mike,5,"Great product,but my older one Sam. 5 one picked whi fi a lot, this needs a much stronger signl, darn!"
B06Y14T5YW,Nance,2,"I purchased this because it was a US unlocked phone and could be used in the US and abroad. I have Verizon as a service and although the phone wotks, it has issues because it is made for Sorint service."
B06Y14T5YW,Bill Wade,1,When you spend almost $700. for a phone you should be able to expect to get what you ordered. Phone was not received unlocked. Got transferred several times and whoever I spoke to was unable to help. ( Spoke very poor English and they may as well have been on the moon the connection was so poor.) Next time I'll go to the AT&T store and pay more but I'll get what I pay for. As soon as I return this phone that's where I'm going and get me a phone. What a waste of time.
B06Y14T5YW,Brandon,2,Came with a stuck pixel in the left-center of the screen. It's extremely annoying and i've requested a replacement.
B06Y14T5YW,doesitreally matter?,4,Just bought this as a graduation gift. I expect it will be good as I have one of my own.
B06Y14T5YW,S.H.,5,"Love Samsung products! This is my 3rd android from Samsung, and each upgrade just keeps getting better. Good price, too!"
B06Y14T5YW,Danny,1,"At my house Version is the only carrier I had any luck with signal strength. A must have so you don't drop calls or text. I never had any problems with my Samsung S4. When I got this new S8+ I really liked this phone . I hated paying that much for a phone but I keep them a long time . The huge problem I'm having with the S8+is the reception sucks. One to two bars if I'm lucky and it constantly drops calls and fails to send text. I really like this phone so bit the bullet and purchased a cell phone extender antenna for version . Another $130 added and a real pain to install. After all this it's not better if anything it's worse. IS THIS PHONE WORTH IT ? Srue .....That is if you don't mind running out in the middle of the street when it's snowing
just to make a call. Yes I'm being sarcastic and yes this phone is a joke!"
B06Y14T5YW,euroxin,4,"The phone is amazing rather for some rattling that happens when you shake it. The headphones broke shortly after a day of use which is bad specially for $100 headphones, didn't do anything to them, just normal use and they broke."
B06Y14T5YW,ccdobes,5,My husband got this for himself and took it to the Verizon store and had them sit it up.
B06Y14T5YW,JLem,1,"Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling.

The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""

I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call.

I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future."
B06Y14T5YW,William A,1,stop now!
B06Y14T5YW,Lesley,2,"Phone had scraches on it. The phone and the items in the s8 box were loose, no packaging to keep the cords, ear buds, etc from scratching the phone."

B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,Charging problems within 2weeks of use. Frustrating to say the least.
B06Y14T5YW,P. Lee,5,The phone is good and I got a 120 down. I would like to buy one more for my other daughters.

B06Y14T5YW,Movie Watcher,5,"This, made in Vietnam, model replaced my beloved, well served s4. Like the s4, the s8 represented big changes in cell phone tech. At $750 last year, $500 this year is a bargain. So far so good. Connected to Net10 in minutes."
B06Y14T5YW,michigan,5,I did not buy for myself. Getting early presents done.
B06Y14T5YW,Kevin H.,1,"device was defective, would returened it if i didnt throw away the package it came in. Would not recommend buying used. Should of went with my gut. Very angry"
B06Y14T5YW,ranger,5,Shipping was dismal. But the phone was as advertised and we'll boxed with all the proper items. Would definitely buy this again.
B06Y14T5YW,Customer,5,Worker with Verizon only 12mp camera should have more
B06Y14T5YW,Miguel W,5,I was about to get the Samsung S8 Note if it was cheaper but I got this instead. Tons of features and just an overall satisfaction with the aesthetics
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Good
B06Y14T5YW,Folk Master,5,This is the best and most beautiful phone I've had. Hands down a sight of beauty.

Yes I purchased as Used GOOD but this was less than good and for $550, that's still a lot of money. Very disappointed. It states original packaging but may be damaged, did not say missing parts."
B06Y14T5YW,David perez,4,Great phone looks amazing just the camera still isn't the very best I thought you can see everything clear that's obviously a lie because I can't
B06Y14T5YW,Alberto,1,I got a phone without charger? What happened?
B06Y14T5YW,Jorge hernandez,1,I purchased the unlocked version of the galaxy s8 plus. When the item arrived instead of it being the s8+ they somehow crammed a galaxy s7 edge in the galaxy s8 edge box. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
B06Y14T5YW,Jake W,5,Excellent phone with incredible battery and it's extremely fast. It comes without all of the carrier bloatware and you still get 90% of all the features. Worked perfectly by just inserting my Verizon sim card from previous phone without having to go into the store.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,It's a good thing to use
B06Y14T5YW,Devon,4,over priced smart phone it is what it says it is.. works great

B06Y14T5YW,kate,5,Very nice ðð½
B06Y14T5YW,KEH,2,What I like the most is the overall phone and all that it offers. I gave it two stars because it lacks the critical functionality of Wi-Fi calling. If this unlocked phone had Wi-Fi calling the I would have given it 5 stars.

Fell out of my pocket while sitting in a chair and the screen is shattered. Will never buy another Samsung product, even though my home is filled with them.

Edit: I've been having fun destroying this POS phone since the first break. It's now virtually impossible to read the screen and the sad part is how simple it was to get it to this point. A couple of ""accidental"" drops and the screen is completely trashed! Almost worth the price of the phone for the pleasure of reducing it to what it really is,,, garbage."
B06Y14T5YW,Vandhana Kalyanaraman,1,Got a damaged product. The bixby button was broken. Very disappointed. Returned it immediately.
B06Y14T5YW,SHB,1,"This is the last time I buy a Samsung phone. I was an avid user of the Galaxy S6, and I loved it, so much that I still have it and I use it as a replacement phone sometimes.

B06Y14T5YW,BrokeMaterialist,4,"I enjoy the S8 - it's sleek, got a large screen, and large numbers for my fat fingers to type on. I'm still a terrible texter, but at least I'm LESS terrible on this slightly wider screen. Bixby does get annoying - lord knows I yell at it every time I accidentally hit the Bixby button on the side, but I do love this phone."

B06Y14T5YW,RickGods,1,this phone doesnt work! some day just die and thats it!
B06Y14T5YW,Matt Magiera,1,"I have many Samsung products, and am happy with all of them, but I am not happy that this phone requires not just one, but two proprietary pieces in order to charge it properly, or one just to hook it up to another device. It does not have a Micro USB connection, it has an adapter that you need to use just to hook it up to a Micro USB cord. If you plug the USB end into any normal charger, or even a USB port on a computer, the phone takes FOREVER to charge (25% charge over 8 hours). You need to plug the cord into Samsung's ""adaptive fast charger"" in order for it to charge in a reasonable amount of time. The whole reason I buy Android instead of iPhone is because I don't want to have proprietary software, hardware or peripherals, I want to buy things that work across multiple devices. I have Micro USB cords everywhere, at home, in my car, at work, one stashed in my luggage in case I forget to pack one on vacation... now, they are all useless to charge this phone unless I happen to have not one, but both of the proprietary parts needed to charge the thing. Unless, of course, I pay them just to have extras so that I can conveniently charge my phone anywhere that I am. It really seems like Samsung is trying to separate themselves from all other Android products by having their own charging devices, and they even have their own Apps and a Browser. All of this I can avoid if I choose, except the charger part.

I, like others, have most everything set up through Google, but Samsung wants to force you to use their Apps and software, like Bixby, their version of a personal assistant. And there is no way to replace Bixby, you can turn it off, but the home key is forever tied to this app. I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android.

The phone does not have a way to double tap a notification to open it; you need to unlock the phone, then open your notification. I've researched this online, and others have the same complaint and no way to turn on that functionality."
B06Y14T5YW,lliliam,5,It's good
B06Y14T5YW,Ms Black,5,I love it! Thank you.

B06Y14T5YW,Sinoy Peters,5,It's all I expected and more. Excellent buy!
B06Y14T5YW,Jessica L James,2,Not compatible with Virgin mobile.
B06Y14T5YW,Louwho,3,"I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs.
They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me.

The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that ""take me home"" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out.

Two major complaints:

The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly.
Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers.

The screen. While the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would. It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case.

Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer."
B06Y14T5YW,Benny s.,5,Great product. Bought it used was scared at first that it won't look satisfying but when it arrived I was amazed that there wasent a scratch on this thing. Thank you so much
B06Y14T5YW,GPorras,5,"Great product, fast shipping."
B06Y14T5YW,janice399,5,I had a perfectly fine usable samsung 5. This samsung 8 is really nice. Panic over elctronic price increases caused by the idiot con mans tariffs inspired my spending. Phone is wonderful though and i will be fine with it until 2020. My samsung 5 phone makes my granddaughter happy because she hated her memoryless apple phone. Samsung makes great phones not cheating on the memory needs to use a phone like apple does.
B06Y14T5YW,Dylan,2,Love the s8 phone itself. I had destroyed my first one and bought this one to replace it. I have Verizon wireless as my carrier. So i got this unlocked one. You loose some Verizon features like visual voice mails that I did not realize upon buying. But now after a month of use the Wi-Fi stopped work. Shows it's connected until you try and load a webpage or use an app the Wi-Fi crashes and has to restart and connect. Will continue to do so and the page will not load till you turn Wi-Fi off. Leaving me pretty dissatisfied with a 1 month old phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Coedy,1,This phone is great except for the fact that the screen scratches incredibly easily. Just going in and out of my pocket the phone shows a multitude of scratch marks running up both edges of the face and randomly across the front. All I can say is that gorilla glass 5 is definitely not where it's at. If the screen didn't scratch so easily I would definitely recommend this phone but because of it I would definitely wait for something else.
B06Y14T5YW,K,1,The camera is great but the phone itself....negative. The glass on this phone is very fragile. Even in a case this phone is fragile. Most cases cannot protect the infinity screen. Visit Samungs website and go to the community forum and look for broken screens. I wish I had before my purchase. I shattered the back and it is costing me $70 to repair. And of course if there is physical damage it voids the warranty. So use super thin glass and then sit back and collect the repair money. I guess they had to make up for the Note 7 somehow.
B06Y14T5YW,rajesh k,5,All good.
B06Y14T5YW,Jeffrey Bleyl,1,"I know 5 people worth the S8 plus... Between the 5 of us we've had 6 (mine twice now) broken screens. I'm very disappointed with how fragile this phone is. Unless you get a cast that fully encases the phone and takes away the edge functionality, the phone will remain very susceptible to breakage. Other than the screen breaking twice in two months... I love it!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,Shipping on time was horrible. Other than that phone is really good.
B06Y14T5YW,Daniel,5,Great
B06Y14T5YW,Sandra,5,works great..great product love it.
B06Y14T5YW,Edward B. White,1,I requested two phones and am having problem correcting issue
B06Y14T5YW,David Hutcherson,1,"Pro: the screen is better than my iPhone 7 in sunlight.

Con: The main reason this is getting 1 star is because the iPhone locks up all the time. Web browsing itâs lockup time. Pokemon Go itâs lock down time. Gmail, lock city. I quick google search and youâll find this is a somewhat common problem."
B06Y14T5YW,Joyce,1,"Liked the edge to edge screen. But hated the Bixby all. The Bixby kept turning on day and night waking me up. So I traded it in for another phone even though I lost money on the deal, I don't get woken all night long!!!!!!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Cheese Mac Deluxe,1,"The features are alright, but nothing amazing. The Bixby button is just in the way and almost wholly useless. No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen.

I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER."
B06Y14T5YW,Alejandro Alvarado,5,Nice phone

B06Y14T5YW,Sy,4,Have a good application
B06Y14T5YW,Isaac G.,5,Great phone!
B06Y14T5YW,Meriah L. Crawford,4,"Good phone. Nice camera and the screen is good. I hate the wrap-around screen, though. Does nothing for me as a feature, and it makes it hard to get an effective case. My screen protector doesn't work well with the case, either. Definitely going to get something with a flat screen next time I get a phone. Sad, too, because I've really liked my Samsung phones, otherwise. Really like the alarm app."
B06Y14T5YW,Soleda,5,Was wrapped excellently and everything same so neat
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Love it. Way better than a iphone. And cheaper too
B06Y14T5YW,Yuanzhao Zhang,5,Perfect
B06Y14T5YW,Rohit Panemanglor,5,Very good. Still checking out
B06Y14T5YW,LEONE,1,If there's a negative zero i will choose that for this item.I trusted Amazon LLC to be selling efficient devices and I was wrong.It's hardly 3 months since I purchased this item and its not working.i could hardly hear people I am talking to on the phone so i had to use a speaker to hear them.so you can't afford to have a private conversation.I emailed amazon about the issue and because its way pass the return period they didn't help.Warning to those purchasing this item think a million times don't waste your money.Think where its safer to buy cellphones.I believe in Karma what goes around will come around.
B06Y14T5YW,Alex cervantes,5,Amazing phone I love it
B06Y14T5YW,Jason Wiltjer,5,Perfect phone

B06Y14T5YW,Tan,1,Phone came with broken screen.
B06Y14T5YW,soiling hung,5,Excelent
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Its ok
B06Y14T5YW,HYOSANG S.,1,"They sold it as US version but I receive as international unlock version(UAE) - not US warranty covered.
They even gave false information to the Amazon agent when she asked for a production origin."
B06Y14T5YW,Robert Fine,1,"The phone is fine. Exactly what Samsung says it is. Here's what makes it awful. Carriers will not offer coverage for full service area to an unlocked phone not purchased through them. The charges for service are the same, but the service area is limited, making an independent purchase a bad decision. Carriers say it is a chip issue. That's a lie. It is a very easy thing to provide complete coverage for all customers regardless of their phones."
B06Y14T5YW,Ken B.,2,I got this phone to because iPhone 7 plus unlocked had gotten slow after ios 11. This phone is nice but i use At&t and i just found out that when At&t checks your phone on the network they disable wifi calling and edge calling. I found out when my phone started dropping calls at the office about a month and a half after buying it. I didn't see anything about this issue when i bought the phone and now it's too late to return the phone. One more reason to leave At&t!!! Bad job Amazon!!!
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,Pulled out of package. Followed instructions to the letter. All I got was the below. I watched every YouTube video I could find about this problem and couldn't find anything helpful. The phone is a lemon. Reset phone. Charged for 1.5 hours. Reset again and again. Do not recommend.
B06Y14T5YW,Patricia,2,"Beautiful phone. The best part is the aesthetic design. It's pretty fast until you use it for a couple months...Then it starts to freeze, Instagram works like CRAP on ANDROID, Literally crap. Crashes every day at least a couple times. They have so much to work on honestly...
My next phone will be an iPhone NO DOUBT."

The video is a three (3.5) month review review of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus smartphone. We take a look at the design, screen, Touch Wiz, OS, camera, video and audio playback and more. I've been using this as my daily driver and did my best to share my experience.

The short version, if you don't want to watch the entire video - love it. One of the best looking phones out there with an awesome screen, camera, and overall performance. Plus it's water resistant and has tons of features."
B06Y14T5YW,Tommy,5,Works with Verizon and AT&T.. Tried both sim cards. No issues. More than likely will work with international sim cards. Upgraded from pixel XL plus.
B06Y14T5YW,Poiveng,3,"I don't normally write review but Im abit disappointed that I feel like Im getting an Open Box item while I purchased the NEW condition item. There is no plastic wrap around the phone, it does look used; the package didn't deliver on time and there is no bubble bag to protect the item during delivery. Anyway, after I finish setup everything on the phone; I pulled out the headphone that comes with it to test - the volume adjustment is messed up. it doesn't work correctly. the lower button didn't work at all. I would have return this item if I didn't spend 3 - 4 hours setting up and messing around with it. I paid the full price and expecting a brand new phone."
B06Y14T5YW,irishdjg,1,Phone malfunctioned in less than 6 months.
B06Y14T5YW,Linhelmikuu,5,Upgrade from iP6 to ss8 plus now. Very incredible production. It works with GSM carrier. Fast shipping and good customer service. 5 stars!
B06Y14T5YW,Brenda Berenyi,2,"Overall OK, but after several techs could not get it to send any texts I had to returned it."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,I got this phone in August and it already has screen burn in! I use my phone like an average user. Wtf?!
B06Y14T5YW,hameed loghavi,1,"Initially, loved the phone and user-friendly set-up. Sleek design and great photo and sound quality. However, I don't know what happened, but the phone just died on me abruptly. Never submerged it in water, besides light dampening from getting caught in the rain, moisture that other Samsung phones that I have owned that do not claim to have any water-resistance withstood. Had a top of the line phone case from day 1 with no hard falls within last 1-2 months. Bought this phone new, however, it is not covered by any warranty as I am not in the USA. VERY DISAPPOINTED...BUYER BEWARE!"
B06Y14T5YW,Malia,5,"Awesome phone but if it gets dropped in just the wrong spot, part of the screen will crack."
B06Y14T5YW,Kindle Customer,2,I don't know how it functions. I didn't even turn it on. I bought it because of the hype about how big the screen was but when I saw it was smaller than my cheap phone I sent it back.
B06Y14T5YW,Martyna,1,after less then a week the whole back is cracked from dropping it two feet.. why would they make a phone made entirely of glass??????
B06Y14T5YW,matt edmunds,3,"True that it's was unlocked , what wasn't stated was the fact it was a sprint unlocked phone. Loaded with tons of useless sprint bloat ware. Need to root to get rid of all if it. But it works and it's a galaxy s8"
B06Y14T5YW,flying pig,4,It's awesome
B06Y14T5YW,Jims Advocate,1,"Just an average phone. The selling point being that it's an ""edge"" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. Gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. And the screen protector helps but because of the ""Edge"" it leaves the sides exposed. Now the case will cover it as I said, however it will also slowly peel the Screen protector off. And believe me you are gonna need that case. All the protection you can get. Had a foot drop, not only do I have a cracked screen but an actual hole. Waterproof selling point out the window. With such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. Had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently, drains more quickly now. Damn ridiculous. (Update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. They become corrupted) I'm done with this phone, should of given LG a chance."
B06Y14T5YW,Throneless,4,i bought 2 at once. one came with the upper corner not displaying anything. the other is laggyon the upper half of the screen.
B06Y14T5YW,Mr.Engineer,1,Bixby Button...
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,buyer be ware they don't disclose that this unlocked version will not work with some of the Verizon apps I spent 2 hours on the phone with Verizon tech support before they figured out it was a universal phone that didn't have all the capabilities to utilize Verizon apps I will never buy another phone from here it was an expencive lesson learned
B06Y14T5YW,Akash Krishnan,1,Recieved all accesories EXCEPT the actual phone itself. Extremely furiated. Requested replacement and hopefully an issue with Amazon and not Samsung...
B06Y14T5YW,Ren,1,"Unlocked S8 will not fully work on ATT / Verizon. These features are blocked: HD Voice, video calling, volte, and wifi calling features"
B06Y14T5YW,Anna,1,I've only had this phone for 5 months and the charging port doesn't work half the time and the battery dies in hours.
B06Y14T5YW,X_RAYT3_X,4,Amazing phone but I order the cricket sim card kit with it and didn't receive it. I only got the phone
B06Y14T5YW,Maria Noel Moreira,1,"2 months and fail, problems with the motherboard. Services here in Uruguay told me that the phone is irreparable."
B06Y14T5YW,Silver Lioness,3,DOES NOT WORK WITH BOOST MOBILE. DO NOT PURCHASE OF YOU ARE A BOOST CUSTOMER YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE IT.
B06Y14T5YW,Eric offermann,5,Device arrived in great condition and all was set up perfectly.
B06Y14T5YW,Andrew L,3,"Good phone, but the difficulty associated with rooting and the issues with the seller force me to give it a three."
B06Y14T5YW,Debora,1,"Doesn't work good with metro
Super slow even when I connect to Wi-Fi"
B06Y14T5YW,Deborah Onwuka,5,No issues so far
B06Y14T5YW,Kennedy Curley,1,Good chance you break the screen even with a case on.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,My phone stop working i would like to know what to do
B06Y14T5YW,Mazher,1,Screen shattered within 4 months of purchase
B06Y14T5YW,Gabe,2,Not charging
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,K
B06Y14T5YW,Martin R.,5,"Fingerprint reader is not that Big of an issue people, its an amazing phone stop reading useless reviews and get it."
B06Y14T5YW,Terry Carmon,2,Battery life is very short. Will be returning to the manufacturer.
B06Y14T5YW,Mohamed Rajwani,4,As per your instructions: I returned galaxy S8 on 2/27/2018 your label # 420569089304420502100016205514 thru USPS. Shouldn't you have received the item by now ? Thank you.
B06Y14T5YW,Nicolas,2,"i was at the cinema, it fell from a 2ft height and the screen is shattered"
B06Y14T5YW,agjg1111,4,phone battery is quickly discharged. I am using minimum apps but still discharging faster than I expected when bought this phone
B06Y14T5YW,Nino,5,Nice
B06Y14T5YW,Guy in Ohio,4,Going from the iPhone 6s to this phone. Overall l ike everything about this phone other than the camera. The camera is just slightly better the the 6s.
B06Y14T5YW,HENDER ALBERTO MERCADO MOLINA,5,Thank you. All be ok.
B06Y14T5YW,Kingsley H.,5,Out of this World Excellent
B06Y14T5YW,Darth Chalupa,4,"Fairly certain this phone was opened before reaching me. There was no film on it, ear buds were missing, SIM card release pin was missing, and phone was completely dead. It seems like a new phone so I'm sticking with it, but it I think someone took it out of the box, and used it for a time. It explains all of those things. Especially the pin, which should be in a box with the documentation. All the reading material as there, the sheet with the pin on it was missing."
B06Y14T5YW,Ramon Alfonso,5,Best cellphone ever
B06Y14T5YW,Vincent,4,"Great phone, screw bixby."
B06Y14T5YW,Quintin carvalho,5,Cherry
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"It DOPE,IT REALLY DIFFERENT"
B06Y14T5YW,Mrs. Ware,1,I don't know what kind of operating system this was suppose to be but it WAS NOT legit or anything else Samsung makes. I have an S8 and was buying one for my husband so I knew exactly what it was suppose to look like. It was much larger than my phone so I checked the model number and it was for an S8+. The only good thing about this transaction was my prompt refund.
B06Y14T5YW,Massachusetts Mom,1,Be aware that phone does not come with sim card. I bought this phone for my son. We purchased a sim card and attempted to activate online with dismal results through Sprint. When we brought the phone to the Sprint store their sim card also did not work so we had to return the phone. It was very frustrating.
B06Y14T5YW,Evergreen books,1,"I am a long time Galaxy user. My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3. But this S8 annoys me to no end. They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone. If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone. But I didn't.

Battery: I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now. I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying. That's bad enough. But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones. iPhone users constantly complain about it. So what does Samsung do? Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery. So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature? And don't tell me for waterproofing. I don't care. You should be able to figure that out.

All-Glass Case: Are you kidding me? If you look at the phone wrong, it will break. And it's unbelievably slippery. Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back. People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass. Of course it's going to break.

Proprietary charging port: The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0. That was genius, seriously. The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it. In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers. So, what does Samsung do? Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented. What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst. And that's even worse than Apple. iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable. In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection.

Infinity Display: Samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"". Okay, one question. Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market? Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" Obviously. So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone. I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool? In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE. No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.

In other words -- form over function. Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway. Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy."

B06Y14T5YW,ALEX Larsen,1,"MY PHONE WAS LOCKED TO TMOBILE. TRIED IN VAIN TO GET THE ""UNLOCK"" APP TO WORK. CALLED TMOBILE AND ALSO MY CARRIER. NO GO. NOT FACTORY UNLOCKED"
B06Y14T5YW,Agenor Marrero,4,Very Fast ....but the battery needs to be more ./...
B06Y14T5YW,Benjamin,2,hello i bought the Samsung galaxy but when the phone detects moisture it doesnât charge the battery. How can I fix it?
B06Y14T5YW,T Stanley,4,"Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be? Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience.

I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases. It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads.

ABOUT ME
I have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010). I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios. I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad. About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to.
My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it). I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next.

PHONE DESIGN
Big Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions. I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great.
Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand. The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues.
Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc.
Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there.
Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOL
Con - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement.
Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button.
PERFORMANCE/BATTERY
Pro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios. I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here.
Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone.
Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house).
Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either.
DURABILITY
Big Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have.
Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so. I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con.
Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover.
SCREEN
Pro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life.
Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience.
Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it.
Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life.
Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone.
CAMERA
Pro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone.
Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class. I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone. In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone. In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance. My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens.
MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose. I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone.
STORAGE
Pro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards. None of that bulls**t Apple gouging.
PORTS/BLUETOOTH
Pro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway.
Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones.
Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me. When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind.
AUTHENTICATION/SECURITY
Pro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con.
Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps.
Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone.
Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model.
Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock.
Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows.
CUSTOMIZATION
Pro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing.
Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size.
Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better.
Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all.
Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message.
Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click. There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took.
Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment.
Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading.
FUNCTIONS
Pro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down.
Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc.
Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call.
Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also). In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment.
Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes.
Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it.
Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage. I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS.
Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con.
Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box.
Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take.
APPS
Pro - Multiple app stores to download products.
Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them.
Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit.
Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps.
Con - Most free apps have ads.
Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase.
UNTESTED
NA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet.

And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:

Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great. And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads.

Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first. A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings. When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front.

Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily.

By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there.

If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon > Display > Home screen > Home screen layout. I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once.

You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use.

The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen. Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now.

The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner & the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later.

The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore. I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other. I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general.

Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums.

If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all.

Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app.
Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) & stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily.
Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency. In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe. If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you.

If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores. I'd run that at this time.

Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores.
Select what displays on your always on display.
Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit.

Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut.

Other Suggestions:
Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night.
Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep.
Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool.

Note:
You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide. Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it.

After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock.
After a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you.

Some apps that I'm using:
Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker)
Downloaded & changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried)
Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this)
Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw)
Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsers
Chat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews)
Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"It wasn't for Verizon phones they said it is for GSM carriers only, not CDMA, it will not work with Verizon. It will work with any global GSM mobile service provider such as T-mobile, ATT, etc. So either I have to switch cell users or return the phone. I haven't decided yet."
B06Y14T5YW,Coleman,5,Phone works great but having problems with the sim card. Says the carrier is sprint but I cant use TextNow (who is a branch of sprint.) Only buy if youre in for some carrier problems.
B06Y14T5YW,phil,2,"Very disappointing battery life just like my old Galaxy S5. Why can't Samsung make the charger port micro usb like everyone else on the planet (except Crapple, of course)? At least they do provide an adapter with the phone which is easily lost. Sin cards are not backwards compatible with old Galaxy S models which cost me an extra $25 for a new sim card to make this phone operational."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"Not headphones arrived, what happen??"
B06Y14T5YW,Klid Saraci,2,"the phone in itself is fine. i bought this with a trade in phone so supposedly i was getting $125 for the old phone. well, a month later, samsung sales came back to say sorry, your item does not qualify for trade in so we charging you 125 dollars extra. i asked to return the s8 here as clearly this was now beyond my budget. well, you wish. they said i had only 15 days after the purchase day to return it so i am stuck now with an over priced item. i am still reporting Samsung to the Federal Trade Commission to try to resolve this issue (after all, how was i supposed to return within 15 days when they rejected the item a month later, clearly the 15 days should apply to the moment the buyer has all the final costs charged). anyways beware of the dirty tricks that samsung plays with the customer. if you come to rely on their support, you may as well be on your own."
B06Y14T5YW,Adeyemoh Mohammed,1,Phone not powering. If I could give it a no star I would have...
B06Y14T5YW,Emily,1,"Black screen on arrival. Black screen. Charge works, the ""accessibility"" voice talks. But no screen at all. So disappointed!"
B06Y14T5YW,kyle,4,"overall after having this device for a little while it is a decent device clean video playback and great camera however the few minor issues keeping this from being a higher review the back glass is very brittle the screen is decent as for durability and great for playback my review would be a 4 star except for the fact that once i downloaded the update that was ready to be installed out of the box (i waited a month before installing so i could see what all was impacted by it) i have noticed a slight decline in battery life and complete loss of the microphone in calls unless i have speakerphone on or an external headset i will update this post if and when a new update comes around to fix that problem.
finally would i recommend this phone? yes i would as long as you keep a headset as part of your daily routine or chose to not install the updates.
Updated rating up to 4 stars as the December update has fixed all problems with the microphone and no longer requireing a head set to use as a phone"
B06Y14T5YW,Candace T,5,Absolutely in LOVE with this phone!
B06Y14T5YW,A P,5,on time and as described. Samsung Galaxy. Enough said...

B06Y14T5YW,Sally Sue,1,"It's been a month and I already regret the purchase. My screen cracked from a 2 foot fall, and with a protective case on it. I've never seen a phone this fragile."
B06Y14T5YW,Cate Murphy,1,"This phone has been way below expectation. This my third galaxy and this one already has to be sent back for repair. I've had it 2 weeks and to send it for repair. Will require almost 2 weeks.
I'm a business owner so really???? Perhaps friends are right...should have gone to an
I phone 8."
B06Y14T5YW,shirley washington,2,This is the worst phone you can buy a used phone samsung galaxys8 drop call and can't dail out just a headache I wish I could return it but I guess got bite the bullet
B06Y14T5YW,SF,1,"If Customer Service is important, STAY AWAY. The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house."
B06Y14T5YW,Nomadh,3,"There is a lot of great about this phone and that's why it's so maddening that samsung seems to go out of their way to want to irritate you and cripple it. I just had my greatest of all time S5 crap out. It was getting unreliable after 4 years and anker stopped making its amazing Godzilla battery for it. From its hay day the only thing it needed an upgrade on was its camera and be touch bigger. It was fast enough, a good size expandable memory and number 1 it could have an expanded battery.
WHY DID SAMSUNG TAKE AWAY THE REMOVABLE BATTERY FEATURE! Me and everyone I know think this is beyond stupid. To the point of not trusting the company at all. Like a car company that has en engine that can run on its own solar panel but makes the car where it can only have square wheels. Why do something ao stupid. I read the reviews for years where the idiot press commented about the ""cheap feeling"" plastic back. And mabe samsung took it to heart. Plastic is light, flexable , removable and can bounce a bit when dropped or can be replaceable. I with the screen could be plastic too.
So what to they do. Make the back glass too? So smart. Let's take my expensive portable electronics and make it more breakable, heavy and slippery!!!! WTH? I cant even shop for a case bafore it falls out of my pocket from 2.5 ft high and dents the charging port and cracks the back glass.
Glass? Why use glass? Everyone is going to put it in a case anyway and now doubly so. So why even bother with glass? And why cripple the battery capability. I'll be getting a battery case for mine and now I'll have to manage 2 batteries as they charge and discharge each other and wear each other both out.
Next is the form factor. Are we making the std form factor for 9 yr old girls now? Is that the new marketing sweet spot? Make the phone bigger but also less useful at the same time. What aspect ratio is this thing? Samsung, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
3rd. Rounded screen edges. Show me the customer who said ""wow good phone but can we distort the edges more and make it so I accidentally press commands while I hold it.""
4th is Bixby. Yes we needed Google now to extend into the apps more and get more granular so why not build on Google now? Because the basic Bixby sucks. It can't get a command right. And even after correcting it 4 times still can't recognise my town name. But they added a whole special extra button for that junk pile. Take away the home button but add a special bixby button, Thanks.
Now to just wait for the inevitable moment where I need to do a battery pull for a reboot.

Competitors take note. Make a rugged expandable, practical smart phone and you will collect a very loyal market segment. Give us a 2 or 4 or even a 6X sized battery. Let us switch between. How about an internal micro sd and an external to pop in and out. How about a charging port and an HDMI or dual combos for when the first charging port wears out. We dont care that its octo core or has trillion by bazillion screen rez. Just make a phone good enough, useful enough and tough enough to be useful everyday."
B06Y14T5YW,jacqueline williams,1,I bought this phone not 6 months ago and the motherboard went out. Can't be fixed! Now I see there's only a 30 day return? What a ripoff! I want my money back!!!
B06Y14T5YW,Jerilyn,1,"The phone we received was a counterfeit. If you have doubts if it is a fake, do some research. When I researched, I found things to try and confirm if it is a true Samsung phone or a knockoff. I did some things like, tap on the back a see if it is plastic or glass and look at the size of the bevel of the phone. Buyer beware!"
B06Y14T5YW,Javier G.,1,Bought for my wife for christmas was delayed for 2 days then when i recieved it i opeened it there was no phone inside only a charger amd owners manual
B06Y14T5YW,Raul,1,
B06Y14T5YW,Nicholas J. Yunker,3,"Excellent phone. The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:

1) No replaceable battery. If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset. Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost).
2) Bixby...just plain annoying! The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.
3) Curved glass. While this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying. If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone. Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate.

Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else."
B06Y14T5YW,Doughmay,5,"Samsung Galaxy S8 2018 Review

Introduction

The Samsung Galaxy S8. A device that has ushered in a new era of design in Samsungâs mobile division. Now, Samsungâs âBest smartphone everâ is a year old. So, How does it hold up in 2018?
Iâm going to preface this piece by saying that I havenât bought a flagship since 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6S in 16GB. Since 2015 smartphones have changed A LOT. Bezels in flagships have become a passÃ© thing. And releasing a flagship with bezels in 2018 seems more of a taboo than a design flaw. Bezels in a 2018 flagship are considered unacceptable by most critics. And in some ways I can see why but weâll talk about that later. For now letâs do a basic overview of this device.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 was released in early 2017 with a QUALCOMM snapdragon 835 SOC, an Adreno 540 Graphics chip, 4 Gigabytes of RAM, and 64GBâs of storage. Compared to other 2017 flagships, these specs arenât anything special, however one thing separates from the rest. The design of the phone. The curved back, and curved display with a marginally thin side lip, makes for a phone that molds into your hand. The glass front and back also makes the device very slippery in the hands. Which for me, isnât a good thing. While itâs aesthetic is beautiful, I need a case on this thing to give me the grip I like. On the bottom of the device we see USB-C, a admittedly small bottom firing speaker, and surprise, a headphone jack. On the sides youâll find a power button as well as the volume rocker and bixby button. On the top youâll find a sim + micro sd card slot. And on the rear youâll find a fingerprint sensor on the right of the 13 megapixel camera lens, and flash + heartrate monitor. But letâs go back to the headphone jack for a second. As I mentioned earlier my phone has been the iPhone 6S for about two years now, and headphone jacks for me are STILL a must have. My 3.5mm earpods work fine, so why replace them? Iâm glad the S8 kept the headphone jack, itâs a breath of fresh air in a market where less is apparently more. And, in some respects the S8 nails what âLess is moreâ means. With this philosophy being most prominent in the display.

The Screen
The Screen of the Galaxy s8 is a beautiful Quad HD AMOLED panel with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio that takes up most of the front side of the phone, and this is a good thing. No longer do we see large bezels that do nothing for the device. In a way the display is not only more beautiful but also more utilitarian. The more screen real estate makes for a more satisfying experience in some apps, allowing one to be fully immersed in the content. While not every app is optimized for this screen ratio, a decent number of apps are, and the ones that arenât optimized are easy to make them look nice and fill the display. The panel itself has Vivid and bright colors that arenât as saturated as Samsung displays usually are, they are a little truer to life. The curved glass makes a return from the S7 Edge, a welcome inclusion to not only the design but the functionality. The edge tab, while not for everyone has made my experience with the device very interesting. Itâs customization is awesome allowing you to choose what information to show, so your never flipping through any useless panels. The edge lighting on the display is also helpful for notifications. The Viewing angles in the display are also very good. Colors are nice and smooth in a wide variety of viewing angles, and the very bright capability of the display also helps viewing angle quite a bit to mitigate reflection from lights and the sun, so no matter what angle your viewing the display from youâll almost always get a good clear picture from the phone. Overall, this phone has one of the best and brightest displays around, even today in 2018. So, how does Samsung utilize these features in Software?

The OS
The Galaxy S8 originally shipped with android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung Experience 8.0, but now Android 8.0 Oreo is available for this device and with it brings Samsung Experience 9.0 to the table. We see a return of all the features from Nougat, with some little added features in Oreo, that without much investigation could go unnoticed. But, these features are very helpful to the user experience over stock android. The Launcher is intuitive and very customizable which is something I enjoy out of the box! The setup process is very easy to get through, it felt very iPhone like, which is a very good thing. The ability to change the button layout is also a very nice touch that allows the user to change it to their liking, this feature is not available on stock android, but it is present here which is all the much appreciated! The facial unlock, while not iPhone X level Is much more intuitive than it used to be, it is also for the most part pretty fast and accurate, the software also makes it very easy to register a face. Google Assistant and Samsung Bixby is baked right into android. Google assistant is my preferred assistant just because of my previous usage history. Bixby is the new-comer to the digital assistant game. While itâs good, itâs not great. Some things it doesnât understand yet, and overall to me it seems like a half-baked effort. But thatâs not to say it isnât getting better so my opinion might change as Samsung updates Bixby over time. Side note to Bixby, The Bixby button as mentioned in the overview is a button located under the volume rocker, it is mapped n default to launch Bixby by default, which is annoying. It can be remapped to launch something else using a third-party app, but other than that the button is quite useless in the software experience. If you are switching from iPhone to Samsung, the software may be a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it is quite nice, although Samsungâs emoji are quite weird compared to the iPhone and some emojis donât show up at all or are completely different than the iPhone counterpart. If you are switching from another device or android phone, the interface might be a little heavy to say than what youâre used to, so tread with caution if you love stock android. While the software brings many new features it also lacks consistent security patches. You will get a security patch every 2 â 3 months, but itâs not as consistent as I would like. Security is important to me, and I donât like the idea that Iâm not on the latest and greatest security patch, however if you can look over this, as itâs quite nitpicky than youâll probably love the Samsung software on your phone.

The Camera
In 2018 smartphones have become the go-to camera for most casual smartphone users. We expect our cameras to take good pictures of us, our family, our children, our adventures in life. And to put it simply, the rear camera is AMAZING! It still does very well in 2018 against other flagships. Itâs quick auto mode allows amazing shots to be taken without any input from the user. The integrated pro mode also allows the inner photographer inside stretch its legs, with ISO and shutter speed controls just to name a few being present. There are other rear camera modes that will help in certain scenarios but often auto and pro mode will be plenty for taking pictures. The rear camera will give you shots that are Instagram worthy. The front facing camera is more mediocre. It takes OK, selfies and the automatic face enhancing features can sometimes make oneâs face look plastic. But once face filters have been turned off, in good lighting the front camera can produce some good selfies, not AW inspiring ones but, decent ones nether the less. Video recording is of course present, and the rear camera is optically stabilized so shooting smooth and stunning video is no problem. 4K recording is also here, but it can be shaky and isnât as sharp as I would like for 4K. The front camera also has video but It is not stabilized so video from this selfie cam can be shaky. Also please note, if you are a heavy snapchat user, this camera does not play nice with snapchat due to the lack of optimization from snap inc. So photos look noticeably worse than what the normal camera app would take, I would highly suggest sticking with the stock camera for most picture taking needs.

The Tradeoffs
This phone despite all of itâs great highlight features has some flaw you want to consider. The fingerprint sensor can be hard to find due to itâs close proximity to the camera. The Speaker isnât that loud and can easily be muffled by your hand depending on how you hold it. The phone also is very easy to drop, and Gorilla glass 5 while great, wonât always save you from an accidental drop. So always have some sort of extra grip on the device to protect it. In stressful tasks it can also get hot and drain the battery, so try not to push it too hard all the time.

Overall
This phone in 2018 is an amazing device still. Consider it if the S9 or note 8 are too expensive. This is as close youâll get to a modern phone that is also fast and very sleek! Despite it being a year old, itâs age isnât showing at all! I love it!

B06Y14T5YW,Ian Chrisman,1,"Product was a lemon, within a week out of the box developed touchscreen problems. Contacted samsung technical support and was told the only recourse I had was to ship the device out to some nebulous repair facility for approximately 1 month. Was acknowledged as a defect yet would still not exchange device for a functional unit without a 1 month turnaround.

I have used galaxy devices from S3-S6 and after this will never purchase another samsung electronic of any variety."
B06Y14T5YW,Enigma,2,"I bought my Galaxy S8 directly through the Verizon store, but I need to vent here on Amazon to warn others about he Galaxy S8 and even the new Galaxy S9's that are coming out very soon... Overall, the Galaxy S8 is a great flagship phone, it's fast, and offers amazing features. The biggest downfall, and why I'm likely to return it and grab a Pixel 2 phone, is a severe lack of good-quality aftermarket phone accessories that properly protect the phone. I'm used to going out and buying an Otterbox Defender, or a LifeProof for FULL phone and screen protection, and being happy about it. Unfortunately, if you look up the reviews for the Lifeproof or the Otterbox for the Galaxy S8, you will see just how much of a difficult time the aftermarket accessories providers have had with trying to FULL protect this Galaxy S8 phone because of its curved screen.

Because of the curved screen on this phone, it is VERY hard to find ANYONE who makes a fantastic all-around screen protector or case for the Galaxy S8. Sure many people SELL cases and screen protectors for this S8 phone, but if you actually read most of the reviews on the aftermarket protective devices for the Galaxy S8, you'll see that the curved screen causes all kinds of issues such as killing the functionality of using the heart-rate sensor, or fingerprint reader, or the touch screen not working properly or as well as it should because of a curved screen protector goes on top of it. The curved screen on these Samsung phones, in my own humble opinion, is a terrible fad that needs to go away. It reminds me of when Samsung and others were also trying to push their hardest to sell curved LCD/LED TV's after the 3D-TV push to the American market failed due to impatient TV manufacturers waiting for 3D and curved screens to take-hold.

When I bought my Galaxy S7 I purposely opted for the NON-curved screen because I was on the fence back then too. Now that Samsung has completely forced everyone into an ""all-or-none"" scenario where I can only buy a regular-sized curved screen, or a bigger-sized curved screen. After having tried this Galaxy S8 for a week now, buying the Otterbox and Spigen screen protector along with some tempered glass protectors that kept popping off because they only stay secured to the curved screen via a thin glue that is applied ONLY around the edges of the glass screen protector, and then trying the Lifeproof Fre case, and then trying the Ghostek waterproof case...I've just about lost my mind. The curved screen on this phone has NO good product that I can find where there is not a gap between the screen protector and the phones actual screen, making lots of texting and typing a major pain. The cases all seem to hinder functionality of fingerprint and heart-beat sensors and mess with the front AND back camera lighting a little, and they muffle speaker phone calls a bit... I could live with all the downsides EXCEPT for the touchscreen issues. If you cant touch the phone properly and make accurate presses, then the phone is useless and fails in its biggest goal as being a smart phone. Add insult to injury, every case I've tried still still leaves the curved area of the LCD screen unprotected (otherwise you wouldnt be able to use tabs or the curved screen functions)...but because these cases never properly protect the edge of the curved screen, it means that there is always a possibly of dropping your Galaxy S8 and it lands at such an angle where the edge of the curved screen hits first, and this will easily cause a broken or cracked screen. Look at the reviews for various Galaxy S8 cases and screen protectors on Amazon photos, and you'll see many broken-hearted people who thought their phone would be safe from a 4-foot drop onto the floor.

These curved screens need to go away. Until I can get a FLAT-SCREENED phone with no dumb curves from Samsung (flat screens make it easier to get third-party accessory support for protective cases that actually work properly) then I'm done with Samsung after this recent headache. It's too bad too, because I've been a loyal Galaxy user since the Galaxy S2, and I've owned the S3, S4, S5, S6, AND S7 and was always very happy with the case and screen protector options that I could buy in the past. With this Galaxy S8, I'm almost certain it will end up broken with the S8 cases and screen protectors that are currently available on the market. Therefore, the Galaxy S8 goes back to the store and I'll have to buy a different Android phone. Samsung, please cater to all of your customers while keeping phone protection in mind. I'm sure that Samsung loves broken phones while selling replacements with all of the accidental warranty services out these days...but I dont want to buy a $700 to $1000 phone only to have crappy physical protection for it due to a silly curved screen. A curved screen isn't worth the potential losses and breakages to me.

Seriously, what the heck."
B06Y14T5YW,Courtney H,1,"I feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem.

I will not be buying a Samsung product again."
B06Y14T5YW,Arsslan B.,1,It gets stuck. Have to force restart frequently.
B06Y14T5YW,Danielle V.,4,"UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures.

When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)....

And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price.

So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed.
I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere.

If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read. Maybe Amazon will get it, too?"
B06Y14T5YW,Jonathan Dagnillo,5,"I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out. I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them. I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage. It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off. The UI was cartoony and had weird colors. Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me.

The feel:

The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels. It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass. It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium. It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble. With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.

While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand. While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive. Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now. They work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.

The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.

As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case. I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be. It's delicate. The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests. The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion. The volume keys are too clicky. The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop. A case solves all of these problems. Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone. I personally went with the Spigen Rugged ArmorÂ Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, SpigenÂ® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609Â case, which I highly recommend. There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.

Software:

For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly. I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen). But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable. A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did. I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much. You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it.

I like the way Samsung has set up their apps. They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features. Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor. My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file. The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures. But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use. Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.

There is still bloat though. Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me. It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment. I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone. You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others. It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants.

To be honest I didn't even try Bixby. Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant. Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that. The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.

The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts. This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with. There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen. That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.

Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by. My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it. The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen. I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment. I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way. I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay. As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.

Hardware:

Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader. I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler. It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc. Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera. However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone. Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.

Battery life so far has been great. This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life. My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors. This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone. I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime. The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.

I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon. I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead. This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.

Call quality has been wonderful. The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing. I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder. The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way. I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode.

The screen almost needs its own catagory. As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED. I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good. The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed. But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect. The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with. The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with. You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly. As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear. Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it. The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides. The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked. The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain.

The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone. I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality. In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice. In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful. Colors are great and they've very clear. Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second. Low light shots were a mixed bag, though. The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring. This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better. Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed. However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it.

Summary:

I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers.

Overall I love this phone. There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy. I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance. It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend it."
B06Y14T5YW,Mike S,1,"I bought my unlocked US version S8 from Best Buy about six months ago and it has progressively been randomly restarting more often and even with the US version, Samsung's customer service is atrocious. It'll restart in the middle of phone calls, while I'm driving with Google Maps open, or while it's just sitting there with the lock screen on.

I keep the phone up to date, the apps up to date, tried deleting all my apps, cleared the system cache, used safe mode for a few days, removed the SD card for a few days, and nothing has worked. It wasn't that big of an issue for the first 2 months, although I can't say how often it restarted because it does so randomly without notification (sometimes I'll pull it out of my pocket and it'll be rebooting), but I noticed it restarting about once a week. Now, however, it's so unreliable that I make sure I know where I'm driving before I leave the house because odds are it'll reboot, no matter how short the drive is, and last night it restarted 3 times during a ten minute conversation with my boss. It's just a piece of junk.

What's worse is Best Buy's warranty is only 14 days and Samsung's 1-year warranty has some serious strings attached that I'm sure they intended to make it a last-ditch-effort. After a long chat session with Samsung they gave me a packing slip that was only good for 2 days, I even had to procure my own box and packing material, and they told me the turnaround time would be about 3 weeks, primarily so they can cheapskate the domestic shipping. Then, they'll either fix the phone or send me a refurbished one that hopefully had its kinks worked out (otherwise rinse, repeat), and that's only if they determine the phone is a factory defect. If they determine I was somehow responsible then I'd have to pay the full price for repairs and shipping, and where they draw the line at acceptable wear and tear is anyone's guess, but presumably it's not going to be biased in my favor, especially based on how they've conducted themselves so far. Super convenient, right? So those of you upset about not having a Samsung warranty, trust me, you're not missing much.

The best solution I've found is that some Best Buy stores are Samsung Authorized Service Providers, so they can do the repairs in-house. The bad news is that these repair centers are only in like 10 states and most aren't in major cities, however, there's a huge concentration of stores in the Dallas area. Luckily I'm an airline pilot and I can fly for free, so I'm going to fly halfway across the country next week to get my phone fixed, but I realize that's not an option for most people. Hopefully the trip will be worth it. I can understand Samsung having such bad customer service if the phone was dropped, the screen was cracked, etc, but for factory issues that don't become apparent right away, you'd think it'd be better than trying to get a refund on a Hotwire hotel. especially for a company that sells so many electronics. I mean, electronics are sensitive and the best break before they get to the consumer, but if their business model is to make it so frustrating to get them to stand by their warranty that you just go out and buy someone else's product, no wonder their stock tanked this year. I, for one, am staying away from Samsung until they have a change in corporate culture."
B06Y14T5YW,FG,1,"This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it."
B06Y14T5YW,Clovis Niyukuri,1,Hellooo My screen phone was broken.could you help me please for repair

B06Y14T5YW,Razmataz,5,"So many other reviewers have posted exemplary write-ups detailing the features, benefits, photos of the S8. I won't even try to compare. All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with ""guest guy"") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha's performance in that regard. (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.) I bought. I haven't looked back. The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks).

Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can't hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8 copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone.

I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use. The S8 now uses minimal power while I'm out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day.

A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8. Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers' expectations.

Unlock methods: fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN. (I've used face, fingerprint, pattern.) Fingerprint wasn't working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018).

I'm a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can't imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go. The S8 has surprised me with its incredibly large viewable area, while still maintaining a manageably slim and narrow carrying profile, the perfect fusion of function, beauty and utility, in my opinion.

Read some of the other reviews, see it for yourself, and allow yourself to believe that there truly can be such an exceptional piece of engineering.

So far, it's been a joy ride."
B06Y14T5YW,Kim,1,Piece of junk! Have to shut phone off to get notifications. Not good for my business.
B06Y14T5YW,Stine Olaug Eiken,5,"My boyfriend J, loves his new phone, its a phone he likes he said after using it for some hours."
B06Y14T5YW,Collin Alberts,3,"Honest review: (CONS FIRST)
1. Not durable and hard to protect screen.
If you are active and work out etc. and tend to drop your phone every once in awhile this phone is not for you. I dropped from 2 feet or so and the glass shattered because it landed face down. If you don't believe me look at what reviews say online. Furthermore, the glass scratches very easy. Like if you have a tiny metal button on your Jean's by your pocket or sometimes drop your keys in with your phone. The second part of this is that I tried purchasing a screen protector but the cheap film ones just don't work, you need an expensive glass one that has a special adhesive which may cost an extra 50-100 dollars and ruins the sensitivity and beauty of the screen.
2. The phone can be annoyingly complex
Note: This is just my preference. I enjoy simplicity and ease of use because I'm a rather busy person and I just want things to work. I got rather annoyed when I went to volume down and there were 6 volume bars for media, ringtone, system, Bixby, etc. and the phones recognition when changing apps is not smooth. Example: I volume down in app and media volume goes down, then I close app and volume down, it will still volume down media for a couple seconds, and because there is no silence bar it takes longer to silence your phone.
Second,
There are other annoying things like getting back in to end a call if your looking at other things while talking etc. Just use the phone in a store before you buy it.
Also, I couldn't tell you how difficult it was to purchase things in the Google play store, it took me a long time. I wished it synced with samsung pay.
3. The edge of the screen is constantly being
accidentally activated by the palm of my hand. I eventually turned it off.
4. I just feel there is less security with apps. When I download them they literally always want access to everything!

I have always owned apple phones but I decided to switch after reading tons of good reviews about this phone on consumer reports. Apple's latest scandal of slowing down old phones upset me as well.

PROS:
1. The screen is amazing. I just went back to iphone 8 and I still look back at my S8 screen thinking how much better it is.
2. The camera is great.
3. Amazing battery life.
4. Everything in terms of hardware seems tip top.

At the end of the day a cracked screen is 200 plus to replace as of 4/18. While the hard hardware is great, it's just to fragile and impracticable for the everyday user. If you get this phone please get a good case that protects the front. Hope this helps!"
B06Y14T5YW,Codyk,5,BUY A CASE!!! If you read the bad reviews they all hate the phone because they said it is slippery and fragile!! My only advise is to buy a $20 case and the protection plan! Totally worth it! I bought mine a month ago and it is the best piece of technology I have ever owned. I am a HUGE Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. I recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. It has Bixby on it and she can do ANYTHING... I often use her feature to remind me where I parked or turn the lights off!!! Amazing technology and great phone!!!
B06Y14T5YW,AGMEX,5,"After being an iPhone user for several years, I decided to go back to Samsung again.
I can assure you that this is the best smartphone I have owned.
There is no comparison with IPhone.
Pictures come out bright and vibrant.
Flexibility is great to adjust to one's personal preferences
Having a microSD is a great option

No regrets. Get this one"
B06Y14T5YW,J. Stutzman,1,"2 things about this phone really frustrates me. Since the moment I got it out of the box, no matter how many setting I adjusted, the displays blacks out after 10 seconds. Plus each time I remove the pictures to a safe place to save memory, these pictures return to the phone. Now I understand there are software features at play, but I should be turning these on. This should not be occurring out of the box. Now I got a ton of duplicates stored on my computer harddrive and pics that won't delete on my phone. The other issue I hate is the screen is not protected well by every case I have looked at. I'm told it's a curved screen feature, but why would I want this feature! The screen won't scratch if I set down upside down on a table but if it falls on a rock, it's over. I really hate this."
B06Y14T5YW,Joseph G. Flynn,2,"Actually loved the phone but ""hate"" Samsung customer support.

Before you buy, do a quick search for ""Samsung Galaxy 8 USB Port Moisture Detected"". You'll find hundreds of listings.

The closest my Samsung had ever been to water was sitting in the kitchen (and beyond that, supposedly the phone is water resistant).

The USB Port Moisture Detected warning pops up continuously and prevents the phone from being charged via the USB port UNLESS you turn it off, turn it back on, insert the plug when then Samsung name comes on. Samsung referred me to an authorized center who told me that it's a known problem with the software and that it'll be fixed in an upcoming release. So for the past month, I've been dealing with the constant issue.

Enough .......... got rid of it through the Amazon trade in plan and ""upgraded"" to a new Nokia 6.1.

Never another Samsung product .for me ...... ever."
B06Y14T5YW,David B,3,"For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line. I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it's a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones. Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got. The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box. While I'm sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung's quality control. Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved. If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung's online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:

1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen. Now the bad: The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone. Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse. When watching full screen videos, you will always have a distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen. This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch. Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this. The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen. And when you do find one, you'll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot. (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)

2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great. I haven't had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly.

3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had. It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day. That's from 7:30am to around 11pm. I'd estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day. I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that's the world we live in now. Based on how batteries degrade over time, I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own.

4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well. I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful. If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it. But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it.

5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd. If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy. I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem. With the case on it, my finger is immediately able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner. As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive.

6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions. I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone. This is better than my experience with google now. The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though. It hasn't been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button.

7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong. Most of the review sites praise this phone for ""feeling premium"" and having a great design. I'm sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is. If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is. Both the front and back are glass. Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn't mean premium. What my brain knows when it's holding glass is that it's holding something fragile. I'm an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop. The curved screen makes it worse, as it's significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass. Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone. This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it. If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone. I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back.

8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn't have the guts to check, so I'll have to take their word for it.

Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features. The problem is, there aren't that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android. I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone. The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I'd love to have a phone I don't have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I'd like. The S8 is a nice size. Given the other options out there, I don't regret my s8 purchase, but I don't love the phone, and I'm not confident that I wouldn't have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6."
B06Y14T5YW,janna k.,5,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!

Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone. In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Homeâ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.

This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use! One other function they did away with - because of the âHomeâ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot. Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!

The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.

When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Iâve been HOOKED! I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds itâs low-light capabilities of it's predecessors! In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in âCameraâ). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) âFoodiesâ, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased! Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!

Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets! As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities. I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my âTalk and Surfâ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so itâs a toss up!

As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee. Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung. It was worth it and havenât gone back!"
B06Y14T5YW,The BW,5,"This is an amazing phone. I bought it outright and had it unlocked immediately on a CDMA plan. Took a trip and my carrier wasn't anywhere in the area. Found a local store that said only one was. He sold me a pay as you go SIM, which allowed me to do texting, but I blocked all the rest, and it worked perfectly. Just as promised by Samsung, it is broadcast band independent!"
B06Y14T5YW,Kindle Customer,2,"Screen is EXTREMELY fragile. Featuewise and style, this phone has everything. But the screen cracks from simple drops. In my case it went from my lap, bounced off my foot and flat on the floor. Picked up and had multiple fractures throughout the screen. The local repair shop wanted $400 just to repair it! Sorry Samsung. Build a beautiful full featured phone that can take at least a little drop! I would not recommend this unless you are willing to shell out extra for a good extended warranty. From what I've learned, its not ""IF"" the screen will crack its a matter of ""WHEN""."
B06Y14T5YW,Johnathan T. Lombardo,2,"This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance.

However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made. I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person. You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile. The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily. Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic. Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.

The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket. I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out. I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones. I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket.

My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact. The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least. Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)... However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.

Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long. My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired. One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed. The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own.

Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line"
B06Y14T5YW,Francis Paul R. Valdes,1,Package arrived today with the s8+ BOX and all (charger etc) BUT NO PHONE. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Payed this much for just a box! THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING OR END UP HAVING A BAD TIME. Hoping for a replacement or at least a refund because I purchased a phone NOT JUST A BOX.
B06Y14T5YW,Intelligentguy,4,"I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review. When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!

Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect! but... Just Great!"
B06Y14T5YW,Denise Ishibashi,1,The round aged glass is horrible! It is very nice but a nightmare in trying to keep the glass protected and using a phone case . Because its round age the glass protectors keep popping off. This is a lot to pay for a phone and have a good case to protect it!!

I did a mistake to buy this expensive cellphone..."
B06Y14T5YW,Zvolts,4,"Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do.

But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated.

Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design.

Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasnât announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch?

Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner!

I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - Iâm all over that Galaxy Note 8!

Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features arenât things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+. With the Galaxy S8+, I think I have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if I have to put up with Android's goofiness."
B06Y14T5YW,A. Kruh,5,"I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.

1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional.

2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now.

3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1"" screen. This one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has.

4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive.

5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):
5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.
5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.
5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily.
5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.
5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells.

6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now."
B06Y14T5YW,Tj,2,"Didn't work for me. I took this phone to too different Metro PCS locations and they both said the same thing, no signal and activation won't go through."
B06Y14T5YW,Kevin R,5,"I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon). My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans. When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone. I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number. But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number! Easy, peasy. No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada. It just worked! So, how do I like the new S8? Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early. Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook. It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down. Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7. At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded. Sorta like PC's. About the only thing Samsung and Apple can do, IMHO, is to compete on the basis of price. Tis inevitable. Look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops."
B06Y14T5YW,secondbushome,5,"It may not be the flagship Galaxy S phone anymore but this phone is still a work of art. I've owned mine for 6 months going and it still feels like using a brand new phone. This is partly thanks to the recent Android Oreo update (FINALLY!) though Nougat was still running strong up to before the update with just a few noticeable lags. Throughout the 6 months, I was expecting some major drop-off in performance as a lot of users say Samsung phones do over time. I didn't really experience this. Maybe during the next 6 months? Who knows, but the phone is still amazingly smooth and feels like a high-power piece of tech, despite being surpassed by the Note 8 and S9 series. It's not flagship but it is still top-tier, especially compared to mid-range phones that it is creeping into the price range.

BATTERY LIFE: It has been very good, but not amazing, but it survives medium-heavy use with a few ticks of power left at the end of the work day. I normally go home with 20-40% left in the late afternoon, depending on use. I've seen it make it to the end of the night without a top-up charge with medium to light use. It is dependable for a full day of use though not more than that. You will definitely want to charge it at bedtime. I don't ever use Power Saver mode though that is an option if need be and don't really tinker with the battery settings. In conclusion, it is fine with its default settings and you don't have to constantly monitor and change settings to save the phone. The battery only really takes a beating when you use Youtube or play games non-stop. In that case, it will last a few hours.

PERFORMANCE: I am an average user. I use average apps like Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Youtube, some games here and there. With Nougat, performance was as expected for a flagship with some stuttering on apps that use the Internet. For example, scrolling down video and news feeds, you get some stutter but nothing you would think the phone froze. One annoying thing is a lag that occurs after you tap an icon to open an app. After you tap an icon, sometimes it would take a full second for the phone to respond, making you think the tap didn't register and as you are about to tap again, the app finally opens and runs smooth. This lag seems to be specific to Samsung phones and seems to be caused when you force-close apps. When you try to open the app again, it takes longer to load back up. I recently found out you aren't supposed to force-close apps so this can be avoided by not force-closing apps. As of the Oreo update, I haven't noticed this lag anymore. The UI has gotten ridiculously smooth since the update. Oreo has made a major difference in refreshing the phone's performance. It almost feels like running stock Android. Almost...

DISPLAY: This is the best aspect of this phone. I love staring at the phone screen. Regardless of how much older this phone gets compared to new models, the display will always make the phone look sexy. I pick my wallpapers with care because it lends such a strong attribute to the phone experience with this display. Colorful images with a black background really makes things pop and almost look 3D. It is so heavily immersive you forget you're looking at a screen. HD pictures come to life (not literally of course). The blacks are true blacks which really makes a difference. If there is anything special about the phone, it is the viewing experience which is a major selling point because that is something you experience every time you use the phone. This display turns me into a drooling fanboy. The Infinity Display might turn some people off but I love it. It adds dimension to what is on the screen as you see it falling off the edges rather than being cut off at a bezel, so you get the illusion the image keeps going on forever. It's an unique touch that is exclusive to Samsung though it is best to see it in person to know whether you like it or not. Yes, it does create some added glare on the screen in bright light, but the trade-off is something special.

Another thing to point out, the oleo-phobic coating actually works well at repelling fingerprints and feels really nice. It has this soft but smooth gliding feel to it that I haven't experienced with another phone. You fingers feel at home with the touch display. It is not 100% at repelling fingerprints, especially with dirty or greasy fingers, but it gets the job done well. Especially when you compare it to the back glass, which is a ridiculous fingerprint magnet. Use a phone case because the back glass will always look hideous with fingerprints.

...

OVERALL: I might cover more aspects in the future but will leave it there for now. Yes, the phone has some flaws (audio, fragility of being all-glass, the fingerprint sensor is actually quite bad for me, some issues with the camera, lack of software updates though we did finally get Oreo, did I mention the audio?, etc.) but the full package is something great, especially as it moves into mid-range territory. I give it 5 stars NOT because it is a perfect phone but because its features strongly overcome its flaws and leave you with a lasting impression that will keep you looking forward to what Samsung has in store next."
B06Y14T5YW,BookGirlVlP,1,"I recently traded in my galaxy S6 for this galaxy S8+. I am just going to say the 6 was way better!! The talk-to-text feature is horrible, the preemptive text is a joke - on the rare occasion it actually gets the words right AND spelled correctly, it capitalizes all the words it is trying to correct or thinking you may want to say next - even if it is the middle of a sentence!! Then there is Bixby, which, well, just no. It is all bad. Then there is the cutting edge camera in this phone which is really just ok unless you want to zoom in and, no matter, the lightin, you may as well forget it. I definitely miss all the things about my Galaxy S6. Buying this S8+ was a huge mistake. The only good feature on this phone is the size of the screen. I love the Galaxy phones, but this particular model is just a huge fail! I would definitely recommend skipping this model for an earlier one or hopefully the next one that cpmes out will but a lot better. Veey unhappy with this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,BRANDEN,5,"I can not say enough about this phone. It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me.

This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet.

The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio).

At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone.

The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo.

I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem.

The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!

Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time.

With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice.

As you can tell I love this phone. Probably my favorite peice of tech since I got my iPad Pro 9.7. Definitely by this. If you don't get a V30, Note 8 or iPhone X instead if that's your thing.

Easiest 5/5 rating I have ever given."
B06Y14T5YW,fofo,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is stunning from every angle. Itâs easily the best Android phone I have ever held.

The best display on the market currently.
Great software experience.
The camera works in every light and takes the best pictures.
Reliable hardware and wonderful design, very fast.
It feels great in the hand.

Setup takes about few minutes then you get a software update, mine is unlocked and works great with Verizon.

Bixby works OK as an assistant but you can always use Google assistant and it works great.

It is an engineering masterpiece, outstanding performance and the finest big smartphone that you can buy currently.

it comes with high end headphones."
B06Y14T5YW,im,1,"Samsung has lost its credibility for a great phone.

It is mediocre and less than decent at this point. Phone hasn't even been owned for a year. The Battery is already drained and dead.

The screen cracked on the very first drop it took with a case.

This phone is meant to be broken.

DO NOT BUY IT. Go with an LG. Save the money. Anything but an iPhone or Samsung at this point."
B06Y14T5YW,Kristina M. Boyle,1,"4/19/2018 Important update: I finally found a hands free app that works, its called ""Call To Bluetooth"". So now I can make phone calls and launch music hands free. I still don't know why this isn't standard on every phone.
03/29/2018 Had it for 5 weeks. Went from a Motorola to this because my company no longer provides Motorolas. I use it for work, and forgive me sounding ageist, but I'm not of the generation who spends their lives staring at their phones. I use a bluetooth head set so that I can listen in noisy environments like construct sites and mechanical rooms, that works well, but you can forget about hands free operation. Everything I've tried requires that I withdraw the phone from its belt clip, unlock it, then use the voice commands, totally defeating the purpose of hands free. So if I'm driving I have to handle the phone. Not safe. My Motorola also had a motion activated camera, so if I""m standing on a ladder all I had to do was draw the phone, twist it and the camera came on. Now I have to unlock it first, again more attention to the phone, not as safe. I've tried 3 different hands free apps and none of them have overcome this. I did find a 'shake on' flashlight app that works so when I""m doing above ceiling inspections I don't have to look at the phone for that. When I read reviews on this before getting it all they want to talk about is the curved screen. Really? No one over the age of twelve should be captivated by this trinket. I did find out how to turn off the edge touch so I quit invoking bixby every time I handled the thing. And that's another thing, Bixby is just a powerful marketing tool for Samsung. It tracks everything you do and targets ads to you. I have been a loyal Samsung fan for years, still have a Samsung flat screen and DVD that are going on 10 years old and work as well as they did on day one, so I'm guessing the mechanics of the phone will be great, but these features make the S8 less useful for me. Bixby is an insult and I don't care if every other phone in world does something similar its still an affront.
ps: This Amazon account is in my wife's name in case anybody cares."
B06Y14T5YW,Harry Sachs,3,"The phone has too many gimmicks. The curved edges do nothing but make the phone more difficult to use. For example, when larger hands hold the phone they usually have a bit of skin on the curved edge effectively rendering the screen unable to select anything.

Also, the software buttons can be frustrating.

Overall, this is the best phone I've had but the features designed to make the phone look cool actually make it worse."
B06Y14T5YW,David E. Hall,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is one of the largest phones in the market yet it is hard to believe how slim it is. The Infinity Display makes for a huge beautiful screen, which is great for multi-tasking, watching videos and editing pictures, without the distraction of buttons. The size can be a drawback as it is hard to use only one hand unless you activate the one-handed mode. The increased battery size gets me through the day, better than previous models. Having used the fingerprint authentication on my phone for several years, I was a bit disappointed in the placement of the S8âs scanner. It is hard to reach, requires me to pick up my phone and I keep smudging my camera. However, I switched over to the iris scanner and it is amazingly fast. I wear glasses and it has worked with them in various lighting conditions with only an occasional adjustment. Some additional features are included with the camera, such as masks and stickers, similar to other social photo apps, and one unique feature is using Bixby search. Though it is not 100% accurate, it does a decent job of finding similar objects just by the picture. It is actually kind of humorous to see what other things it comes up with, like my buddies dog was identified as a Labrador retriever, horse and cattle. He does seem as big as a horse or cow though. Bixby is an interesting feature that is Samsungâs attempt at competing with Appleâs Siri and improving on their own S-Voice. With the dedicated button you can avoid the usual opening commands of âHey â¦â or âOK â¦â and go straight into what you need. You can still use the voice command of âHi Bixbyâ to get things done if you choose to, but I prefer to just hold the button and start dictating. Bixby does all of the usual commands to help you easily send messages, place calls, set timers and reminders. You can also get Samsung Reward points by using Bixby and gaining experience points. This includes just playing around with Bixby and asking some ridiculous questions like ârap for me.â In return your earned points can get you gift cards or chances to win prizes. Bixby will also read off the time, weather and news highlights aloud for your alarms, a nice touch when waking up in the morning."
B06Y14T5YW,frabjousday,5,"I found the opportunity to test the Galaxy S8+ fully expecting to have mediocre reactions to it. After a few weeks, I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good.

The biggest issue I had with samsung phones is the cumbersome overlay and bloatware that seemed to bring the phone to a grinding halt. My previous experience with the Note 4 wasn't lost on me. It worked well at first but lag made it a chore to use. It's only been a few weeks but I've noticed no lag. Apps open zippily; the camera is quick to use. No longer does it seem like there are a million useless apps to clog things up. The new Touchwiz interface seems much more sleek and the Samsung software actually useful. Whichever apps you don't like, you can simply disable. In fact, I find notifications that the phone has disabled unused apps running in the background very reassuring.

The display is beautiful. Stunning image quality. I love watching videos on it. Yes, samsung tends to oversaturate images but you can choose to turn this down. Blue light display helps at night to reduce strain on my eyes. Edge-to-edge infinity screen with minimal bezels makes this a beauty to look at, and I receive many compliments on it.

Picture quality is great on the camera. Low-light is OK, but day-and-night over my previous iPhone 6. I miss the dual-lens available on the Note 8, but for a single lens, this is great.

Battery life is excellent. I use it pretty heavily for music, chat and web browsing through the day and I never run low. If I need a charge, fast-charge gives me a lot of juice with just 10-15 minutes plugged in.

Cons:
Bixby isn't great. It doesn't seem to wake up half the time with voice commands. While it's not necessarily bad, it offers no real advantages in my daily use to Google Assistant, which conveniently is also available on this device.

Fingerprint scanner. Takes getting used to but with a case, is much more easy to find. Not a deal-breaker by any means.

Speaker is terrible. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the phone which is easy to accidentally cover up. I use headphones most of the time, however, and as this is now one of the few phones that still has a headphone jack, is no problem.

This is by far the best phone I've had, and I'm glad I went with this over the iPhone X which is going for nearly double the price."
B06Y14T5YW,Russell,5,"I have 2 of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend. They both are flawless in performance and features. I see some reviews complain on here about features that can be easily disabled.... which makes no sense... one if you dont like a feature it can be disabled ( bixby, always on display) but why pay $500+ for a phone to not get the most out of it.

Pros:
1. Battery life is amazing, i can have this game playing a game for hours with brightness and graphics all the way up and then look at my battery life, and it still be 50%
2. charge time is better, with the provided charger, and pugin it takes less than 2 hours to charge 0-75%.
3. Bixby... although many dislike her, this is the best attempted AI ever provided. It learns what apps i use and what times i sleep. always watching but a Great mobile AI... want to say the first I believe. (yeah siri isn't AI, it doesn't learn based on past inputs as bixby does.)"
B06Y14T5YW,Joe Bartlett,1,"-Bottom line, this phone is a piece of junk for the price.
-I can't delete pictures anymore... I've tried to delete the same picture 6 times now and it keeps showing up when I go back to my gallery.
-Everyday I have at least one update of a new glitch, flaw, or problem with this phone.... this is my most updated review because of how terrible this phone is.
-New text message notifications do not go away. I've opened the message twice and closed it and it's still telling me the message is new...
-Received a notification today that I've never seen before. The app ""SYSTEM"" was causing problems and needed to be closed... don't I need the system app?
-Power button does not function, it takes at least 2-3 presses to get it to recognize the press.
-Screen was heavily tinted red right out of the box, I needed to adjust the color settings to turn the red completely off.
-""Person is typing..."" text box is right on top of the most recent text so you cannot read it.
-FINALLY, they gave an option to disable the Bixby button, now I just have a completely useless button on my phone. Maybe it could be remapped to be a fully functional power button since my phone doesn't have one?
-Pictures sent via text message take 5+ minutes to send, fail, and then resend in a minute.
-Battery life is getting worse with every update, I used to be able to use my phone over a 48 hour period without charging. Now I have to charge it every 24 hours or less.
-Automatic brightness that adjusts to your patterns is a nice feature. However, in sunlight it defaults to max brightness and you cannot change it. Compared to the S7 this phone is nowhere near as bright. I frequently have problems seeing the screen at max brightness, blacks blend together and any dark movies are unwatchable.
-Audio is acceptable, you can't expect much from a single speaker on the bottom right of the phone... Volume levels are poor. Any background noise beyond a fan will make it difficult if not impossible to hear dialogue in a movie at max volume.
-Auto rotate works when it wants to, never when you want it to.
-Word prediction and swyping on this phone is as bad if not worse than previous Galaxy models. I think it is worse because I'm getting strings of letters that are not even English. I never lift my finger off, and swipe very common words, and end up with gibberish. Some examples: planning changes to pls no do, sending changes to section, doing changes to don, what changes to Wyatt, checking to cur king, stay to starry, anything to abutting, constantly to com subtly, maybe to mary be, keep to Leo, on to oob, something to sobering, today to fist, someone to sombrero get..."
B06Y14T5YW,janna k.,5,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!

Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone. In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Homeâ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.

This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use! One other function they did away with - because of the âHomeâ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot. Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!

The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.

When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Iâve been HOOKED! I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds itâs low-light capabilities of it's predecessors! In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in âCameraâ). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) âFoodiesâ, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased! Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!

Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets! As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities. I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my âTalk and Surfâ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so itâs a toss up!

As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee. Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung. It was worth it and havenât gone back!"
B06Y14T5YW,Nick C,1,"Far too fragile for everyday use. I dropped this from 2-3 feet up (hand at my side), with a case, and the curved glass corner cracked. Samsung of course makes a fortune selling replacement screens, though I'm going to buy another brand phone instead. Durability should be much, much higher at this price point for a device that's taken with you wherever you go. Independent tests confirm poor durability here."
B06Y14T5YW,Epiphany,2,"Phone works great but extremely disappointed in the design. In this case front glass replacement. Doesn't matter if you have insurance or not it's gonna cost you 150 to 300 dollars. I consider this a design flaw but Samsung is pleading otherwise.

I dropped my phone only six to eight inches off the ground and cracked the front screen. I've had other phones like the note 3 and 5 and were dropped from higher places and screen fine. I'm just fortunate enough to have my touch screen still working for now.

I'd rate this phone better if it was designed to easily replace the screen."
B06Y14T5YW,x6729c,5,"I had iphone 6+ and changed to the S8. I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesnât have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc.
The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen.
The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest.
The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me.
It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also.
When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory.
The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I donât know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I donât use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to.
I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you wonât be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices.
The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music.
I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS canât do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS.
As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+.
I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course.
To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones Iâve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also."
B06Y14T5YW,BB,5,"Pretty good looking and impressive phone. I definitely like it much better than the iPhone 6 that I had. I've had it for 2 1/2 months and so far so good. But Samsung is notorious for their phones doing good for the first 6 months and then crapping out because of their software updates. We'll see. I did go for the Sprint 12 month Forever Galaxy Plan so I don't have to wait every two years to upgrade.

The interface is much more intuitive than the iPhone 6. Gorgeous 5.8"" edge to edge Infinity screen. I like how you can crop the screen on YouTube videos. They do need to patch the software to allow users to keep that feature on at all times. Annoying not having that option. Great speakerphone. Loud and clear!

Overall, probably the best smartphone on the market right now. As of this post, Apple just announced their new iPhone X. I remember when Samsung was playing catch-up with Apple, now it's the opposite. The iPhone X seems like a copy of the GS8. Front and back glass. 5.8"" curved screen. Probably the same 18.5 by 9.0 ratio screen as well. I don't think most people care for those fat and wide phones, I know I don't. The GS8 is narrow and comfortable in your hand, still sporting a huge screen size for a smartphone.

I was watching Fox News when the iPhone X was announced and these people, who by the way all seem to be on the Apple bandwagon, were cheerfully saying and bragging about the X's face recognition, like this was some new technology. The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn't have.

Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X's feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face? What class! Apple can keep their NSA iPhone X! I know I know, we have the same problem with Google Android phones as well. Oh well, what can we do? I need my smartphone for work. :-("
B06Y14T5YW,boarhog,2,"Excellent hardware but the Samsung software could have been written better by a sophomore computer science major.

The Samsung Bloatware should be uninstallable by the end user. This is my first Samsung phone and probably my last. I bought two because after being an Android purist with Nexus and HTC devices, I figured I would give them a try. I am really disappointed with the Galaxy Software and store. I love Google photos but the camera app keeps forcing the Samsung app on me. I gave it a two star for the software and lack of ability to uninstall most of it. You can disable some apps but they are usually back at reboot. Even with all of my Google app store credits from survey rewards, this will probably push me over the edge to go to iPhone. Samsung, please get your crap together and fix this software abomination."
B06Y14T5YW,TX gadget nut,4,"I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology. One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone. Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides. I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying. I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else. The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button. The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.

I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me. its cool but I think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.

The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones. Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix. I'm having a little buyers remorse right now. Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay. Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow. 5 - 7 business day estimated turn around. The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price. Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off.

Update on the repair: it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days. THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact. Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.

Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier.. Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think. Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,4,"Definitely a noticeable improvement in speed from the S7; it seems snappier. Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Even though the physical home key is gone, there is still a satisfying tactile ""click"" for feedback if you press down on the location of the home key. You also can lightly touch the home key and it will respond, like the back and menu keys.

The size is nice. The screen is narrow enough that I can reach across the entire screen with my smaller hands, and it is tall/long enough to allow more of a webpage to be read on the screen at one time.

Bixby seems like another S voice knockoff that doesn't quite do things as well as Google Voice. There are some youtube videos showing cool tricks you can do with Bixby that can't be done with the other voice apps, but they seem like tricks rather than useful tools. I ended up disabling Bixby, and there are some low-cost apps available to help you do that. The placement of the Bixby button so close to the volume buttons actually ends up with a lot of accidental Bixby pop-ups when you are trying to adjust the volume.

The camera is awesome. It starts up quickly and the autofocus is fast. There is plenty of on-board memory for photos and video. One somewhat hidden feature in the Edge is the Animation portion of the Smart Select. You can select an area of the screen while a video is playing and create a GIF. Perfect for making a reaction GIF."
B06Y14T5YW,Sebastian Infante,1,"BAD PRODUCT NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AGAIN
â¢ Only allow me use it 2 days.
â¢ No International warrantee so I lost my money
â¢ Common problem with this model

Only works fine 2 days and suddenly white strip appear on right third on entire screen, couple ours after that (following samsung support) made a factory reset and few our after that, screen go black in a middle of a whatsapp message and never turn on again.
INTERNATIONAL WARRANTEE INEXISTENT (so international buyers don't even think about buy samsung products like i do)
Amazon support was great, but only and exclusively with limitation only for US main territory and if you think pour guy bad luck, don't think that, the problem on this model is high.
I share with you this comment like think to make with my more than 15k followers on social networks, I NEVER BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN, my last item was gear 360 and guess what?, no work with Samsung Phone's (only with S6 S7 S8) extensively on other post,I said ""my bad"" to don't be more literate about product, only read about 15 hrs with reviews with another products, and because that and exclusively to use this camera buy a S8,
If you have heard about battery explosion on 7 version I'm thinking ""this thing"" was remembered like a S8 minor problem."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,I guess the phone would be a lot better if I could actually hear the person with whom I was speaking. VERY UNHAPPY!!!
B06Y14T5YW,eksine,4,"I bought my S8 phone somewhere else, but the #1 issue with this phone is that it is the most fragile phone in existence. A 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. They might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is FIXABLE! Go to ebay and search for galaxy s8 screen replacement. Make sure it is NOT just a glass screen protector. It should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. Basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. The kit comes with new glue. Search youtube for how to videos. You will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. If you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. The kit is only $25 on ebay, I don't know what shops charge. You can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone"
B06Y14T5YW,Steve S,5,"These manufacturers are charging way too much money for cell phones these days. A man is supposed to spend 3 months salary on an Engagement ring to ask his lady to marry him, not 3 months salary on a phone.

Joking aside I've been an android user since the beginning of the smart phone era. Before this S8 I had an S5 and it was a very nice transition.

This phone works and works well. I love that it's water proof and when it gets dirty I just hold it on under running water and scrub if with hand soap. The naked phone is a bit slippery so I highly recommend the otter box defender case.

I bought this phone on sale during Prime Day which gave a nice $200 discount plus they threw in a few free toys. The package included the wireless charging pad which I use everyday but would never pay extra for. It's really not necessary. And it came with the VR goggles which I still haven't taken out of the box. I know the goggles need the naked phone and I keep my phone in the otter box case so I'll never use the goggles. If it was an option I honestly would have preferred a heavier discount on the phone and they could have kept the wireless pad and goggles."
B06Y14T5YW,Nick,3,"Great phone for the most part. Broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. Also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. GET A CASE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! Also, I wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"I have owned cell phones since the 90's. I had never broken a screen, and never really had any complaints about any phone throughout this time until the S8. Within 2 days of owning it the screen cracked. I bought another one and within two months the screen cracked while in my pocket. Not only that but the phone is so choppy and sluggish. It has everything laid out in a way that makes constant miss hits. So while you are trying to open one ap, a different ap opens, and then you have to wait 4 or 5 seconds for the ap to fully open, close it, and try again. I wish I would have kept my S6. I speak the words at least 5 times a week....""I hate this phone"" It is the worst phone I have ever owned. Yes, it has a great camera."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"Just after 1 year both front and rear camera failed. Hardware failure, and guess what! the cameras are integrated into the M.B. which makes this a cost prohibitive repair. This fine flagship of a phone has also decided to randomly die with a totally drained battery in less than 8hrs. without any open apps or even using the phone. This was my first experience with a Samsung flagship phone. (I was an iphone user previously, owned every new Apple flagship phone up to the iPhone 7 without a single issue.) This will be my last as well. The feeling I get from Samsung is: Tough luck you should have bought an extended warranty! Nice."
B06Y14T5YW,Jesica Ne,4,I have 2 weeks with it and Yesterday fell down and it Is brocken now ð¤§ð ð¹
B06Y14T5YW,Budgetbee,5,"Samsung has created a wonderful upgrade to the S7. First of all, the 8+ has an increased screen size with superior clarity. The resolution is by far the best that I've seen on a smartphone. Also, the camera is very easy to maneuver with great quality pictures. There are many options to use to get creative. Next, the internal storage is quite adequate and double the S7's. My favorite feature is the battery life. Prior phones seemed to need charging constantly. The 8+ holds a charge very well and requires minimal charging. Since I am often ""on the go"", this feature is invaluable! Finally, the processor is far superior. I immediately noticed a difference when using the S8+. However, I would be remiss not to mention a couple of points that have been difficult to become accustomed to with this phone. The S8+ does not have a physical Home button - which I miss because I am a creature of habit. Also, I am constantly hitting the Bixby button when I am attempting to reach the volume buttons. The positioning of the buttons has been a bit challenging. With all of the positive upgrades, I would definitely recommend this smartphone."
B06Y14T5YW,Matthew,5,"I have not seen a smart phone camera yet that compares to the s8 main camera. It is without a doubt the best camera in a smart phone i've ever seen to date. The pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my $5000 camera i use for professional photography. It blows away apple in my opinion, Yes apple has some decent phones but ISO is not quite a computer if you ask me they can't be plugged into any PC without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don't know your installing on your PC and can damage some pc's.
It also installs some other apps you don't know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the PC if its not an apple.
Any android can be plugged into any PC without a problem with no software to clog up your PC. The processor is killer,
4 gig of ram! And I was sold on the camera immediately. Being in a dark room or outside at night the pictures are crystal clear and can be adjusted with the pro setting it can take some time to figure out if you are not a photographer but still very user friendly.The battery is OK but if you don't have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick. But this can be controlled, Power battery is my most recommended app killer that keeps apps closed and keeps tabson the battery. It really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in. I can't wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price? the s8 and s9 at least for a while. I give the s8 5 stars!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,ElectroTom,2,"Bought this phone from Best Buy June of 2017. Started to play a solitare game for a few hours a day. Now I notice that the parts the AMOLED display are burned in. I thought that burn in went away with Plasma TVs and the old CRT monitors of years past, but Samsung has re-introduced the problem.

I like the phone otherwise, but I know this screen burn in issue will really annoy me. Samsung should be ashamed of themselves ffor using a display type that easily burns in.

Before you buy, Google AMOLED Display and Burn in and you will get all the dope on this serious issue."
B06Y14T5YW,Jstehly,2,"This phone is Shiney out the box, and I've had it for about a year now. I'm counting the days until my contract with Verizon is up and I can properly throw this phone in a lake. Out the box it's exciting and new woo! Fast forward a bit, charger won't stay in port, screen cracks? Oh forget about getting it quickly replaced. You need to make an insurance claim to replace ENTIRE PHONE. and pay the price. Even with insurance it is not cheap. Tons of useless bloat ware, Bixby is a waste of a dedicated button that turns on allllll the time accidentally. Carefully examine other options before committing to this phone. I hate it and will ditch this phone as soon as I can."
B06Y14T5YW,Larry,2,"A great phone ruined by a dedicated Bixby button that can't be disabled. Bixby is Samsung's attempt to force their Siri-like solution on the world. I hit this button several times a day and everyone around me is forced to listen to this stupid BRRIING sound while I try to kill the app. Other reviewers talk about how easy it is to disable it. You cannot disable it.

Again a great phone, but for me no amount of other features can make up for forcing me to deal with Bixby every day."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"This is a mostly good phone with lots of positives. It has a great screen, good speakers for calls and playing music, and the touch interface is very responsive. I even like the curved, edge-to-edge display. However, Samsung seems to be emerging as the king of bloat and has loaded the phone with Samsung's redundant software that adds zero value other than to make Suman feel they are Apple. Bixby is just terrible. In fact, it was still in beta when the phone was released. It offers nothing over Google Assistant or Cortana and yet Samsung added a dedicated button for it and one keeps getting promoted to set it up which I will not do again. Samsung Pay is completely unnecessary. The list goes on but Samsung had a great phone going until the software team got involved and junked it up."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"Extremely fragile. After only 6 days of use it fell from my hand to the table (about 5 inches) and the screen cracked, part of the screen went green and stopped working. What about the ""gorilla glass""?? What kind of ""gorilla glass"" can't resist to a 5 inch fall? Samsung has charged me 430 dollars (in Brazil) to Fix the damn thing.
DON'T BUY IT!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Chuck Thomas,1,"Had the S7 Edge and loved it. S8 plus? home button. Or should I say lack of a home button. Now it's on the screen and way to easy to touch. Once again in an attempt to make something great even better they screwed part of it up. The screen chips extremely easy, even with protector. Got my S8 Plus at Best Buy, they recomended the screen protector, installed it and said its bullet proof now. 1 drop from about 18 inches. Screen protector shattered and fell off plus chipped the screen. Best buys response. Not our problem. Would be an excellent phone if not for the home button and extremely brittle screen."
B06Y14T5YW,bj Galaday,3,"I bought at AT&T store at a much higher price; that's a whole 'nuther story! Pros: Good camera, fast processor, sufficient memory, sharp display, that's it. Cons. It should be said I prematurely retired my perfectly good Samsung Mega (pre-Notes). So this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small. The wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case. Speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile. The aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling Russia, by accident. Don't buy this stuff in AT&T store either. It'll cost 5x! Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete. New Note isn't any better in size either; I liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more. You can still get the I-6S+ which comes close. Really miss my old phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Wei-Yun Chen,1,"After I got this phone, I used it less than 10 mins later the screen was froze and didn't response to any actions. I couldn't turn it off. The device keeps on for 4hrs (only thing good is the battery last long time?!) and was super hot the whole time. It finally shouted off after the battery runs out. This is my first purchase Samsung product and VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I don't understand why a new device stop working in the very first day!
I contacted to Samsung costumer service and it is horrible horrible horrible. I emailed them several times and NEVER got responds (Their website said they will reply within 24 hrs, never happened!!)"
B06Y14T5YW,vonronge,3,"I hate Bixby, and so will you. Don't buy this. Buy literally any other phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Kindle Customer,2,"Have been a Galaxy user since the S3. In my opinion this is the worst one yet. Here is why:

Built in bixby hard button and constant notifications. (If you press it when youre trying to snooze your alarm, you will have to completely unlock phone to shut it off.)

Battery life is worse than the S7.

Finger print scanner is on the back of phone and not readily accessible.

Pros:
Nice big screen with great picture quality.

Can accommodate faster wifi speeds.

Good quality video and pictures and great in low light settings.

All in all probably the worst Galaxy phone Ive owned. Most of the Pros are not very far above what the S7 offers and the 7 was not as finicky. This phone has honestly made me consider getting an Iphone when my upgrade comes back around."
B06Y14T5YW,Guy Bloomfield,3,"Pros:
* Battery life is great. I got a full day off of one charge with regular use.
* Screen is bright and vibrant
* Camera is great

Cons:
* Curved edges to the phone make it slippery and slightly distort the image. They make the phone pretty to look at it when it's off but that's no that point.
* Fingerprint sensor on the back is hard to reach. Plus, it's right next to the camera lens so you smudge up the lens trying to read your finger.
* Comes bundled with Samung's Bixby AI assistant that you can't uninstall. It's triggered off of a button on the side that is only used for Bixby.

Moved to this from a Note 4 and I miss my old Note. It was easier to hold and non-rounded edges gave it more usable screen space."
B06Y14T5YW,Will,3,"The hardware is fantastic. Tested waterproof after floating in my kayak for an afternoon. Has a memory card slot and a headphone jack. It's fast. I get 50Mbps up and down from my cabin in the woods (Donner Summit on T-Mo). Amazing.

The display is high resolution but I accidentally touch the sides which interrupts UX with false clicks. Side touch feature is already disabled but no help. My display has shattered in two places in four months even with a case on.

The software is an abomination. Every single change Samsung has made from stock Android is for the worse. There's an extra hardware button which would be perfect for ""take a picture right now"" but Samsung hard codes the f'er to pull up it's impossibly slow and useless Bixby AI. The whole Bixby thing should be thrown out. If I press that button that means I've missed taking a picture and it's upsetting.

F Samsung"
B06Y14T5YW,Jesse Klaes,4,"Operating System: If youâre a Samsung user, or even if youâve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+. This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up. This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it.

User Interface: This phone also has very friendly user interface. You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with.

Battery Life: The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsungâs in the past. Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life. There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better. One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the âalways on displayâ, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life.

Water Resistant: This is a great feature to have on a phone. You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places. You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone.

Fast Charging: You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible. Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use. With this charger your phone will be charged in no time.

Bixby: The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and itâs supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone. This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free. The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off."
B06Y14T5YW,RK,3,"I just replaced the Galaxy S5 with a Galaxy S8. The screen is beautiful, camera takes amazing photos, better battery performance, and improved signal strength. However I think the texting feature has taken a step back overall but worst of all, the voice-to-text feature is atrociously poor, constantly misspelling words (like 'clubutt' instead of Columbus), despite repeated attempts of speaking slowly and clearly. Also when texting the auto-suggestion and auto-correction feature routinely provides incorrect options."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"Will not support wifi calling (or other Advanced Calling features) on Verizon. I was able to install the Verizon sim and get the phone working without problems but features are missing, with WiFi calling being a big one. Verizon says they are aware of this with Samsung S8 unlocked phones and there is nothing they can do as all features are enabled on their end. Samsung has not responded to my queries so they don't get any points for customer service.

Other things to be aware of: It really is slippery so you need a case, but be aware that the case really won't protect the phone screen because it will be designed not to cover the infinity edges. It really is too big for your pockets. Cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days.

Other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine. I would not buy it again but if you must, get one from your communications carrier, not an unlocked version."
B06Y14T5YW,plumber,2,"Overall very durable except many small problems.

Pros, takes amazing pictures, 4k video. Screen hd quality is great.

Cons, Screen burned in after just 4 months. Battery life is terrible about 20% by 3pm, bixby is useless and keeps re enabling itself after every update, lack of free Samsung app store apps, moisture detection port false alerts therefore cannot charge with power off, the sound from the speakers is very weak.

It's been an ok phone over the last year or so but I will not buy another Samsung device."
B06Y14T5YW,thomas wilson,5,This is the best phone out there and why would you carry an $800 phone in your pocket?? Especially without a glass screen protector?? That's a bad call and there are products out there that strengthen the glass. Why people choose to put them in there pocket is beyond me and I want to protect my big investment. I have an otter box case and screen protector on mine. I work construction and have had no problems with it. So quit complaining and protect your 800 buck phone. Duhhh
B06Y14T5YW,Harley M.,1,"Absolutely the worse phone I have ever owned. Battery life is sub standard. Purchased a screen cover, but the phone has a mind of its own, and the rounded edges make it next to useless to type or navigate, even when the screen is super clean. The phone looks large, but keyboards and apps appear small, and hard to use, due to the curvature of the screen, and the Bixby program that cannot be removed? is the most irritating application known to mankind. I will not be fooled again, never another Samsung product."
B06Y14T5YW,Xteam,5,"I'm rating 5 stars to counteract the carrier shills who tell you not to buy this phone. They are wrong. Anybody who tells you not to buy this because of ""updates"" is a fool. The Unlocked phone is literally the best version, because it works everywhere, and you will never be stuck on a carrier with it. You pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. You won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price. Buy once, cry once, as they say.

Not only that, but you get the phone as Samsung intended, with all features (Samsung Cloud, Caller ID, Device Maintenance) intact and zero carrier meddling."
B06Y14T5YW,Dr. Duke Fantastic,3,"Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful.

The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display."
B06Y14T5YW,Pooja,1,"The phone has so many problems like poor network connectivity which causes frequent call drops, call and text lag, wifi and Bluetooth connectivity issues. The seller says the phone is new but after so many issues I am not sure; its more likely that this is a bad refurbished model of the phone. I bought it as a gift and I feel so bad for the person i gifted it to as this turned out to be worst than his 5-yr old phone with a shattered screen! :("
B06Y14T5YW,thepurplehat,5,"Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Unlocked Phone - International Version (Midnight Black)I love the Galaxy S8! This is a huge deal for me to write a post of the following caliber because I'm not a tech geek or even someone who is very giving in terms of technology satisfaction, but the S8 warrants it. For a long time (possibly for some too long for some), I was quite content using my outdated, but excellent S3. Based on my research, not only was the S8 the most current, but many reviews suggested it was one of the best phones since the S3 and it is. By now you've heard most of the great features, but now you get to hear it from a 50-something female. Let's start with the look. It's just a beautiful phone. It feels good in my fairly large hands, and I feel like I get more because the picture bleeds to the sides. Speaking of getting more, I like the larger size. As much as I loved my S3, over the years I did begin to long for a larger phone, instead of deferring to my Surface tablet. When I purchased my S8, I was tempted to get the Plus, but as it turns out, I don't need it. The best feature for me hands down is the life of the battery and the super fast charger. Do you remember how quickly the S3 used up the battery life? Yes, I know this is very old news for the thousands who upgrade their phone every year, but for the few thousand in my age group who hold on to technology devices for comfortability, I think you'll find this information helpful. With the S8, you will be able to leave your portable charger home because you won't need to use every few hours. My S8 is everything! I've even started going to 1-1 personal Samsung training so that I can optimize use of my phone. OK young, middle-agers: buy it, then write about it!"
B06Y14T5YW,Julio V. Brache,5,"I was trying to decide between the Iphone X or the Samsung 8 Plus. Waited for the X to come out to compre, butt after going to my nearest Apple Store and playing around for a while I decided on the S8 for several reasons: first screen size..second memory expansion...and third ...photo quality...night pictures come out like a pro! you may even take a picture with voice command on the S8. Also transfering data from your old phone was very simple with Samsung connect.
Last but not least..price..you would have to pay $300 more for the X !
I had the S8 for one day and is a great phone!"
B06Y14T5YW,BDelicious,1,"Someone hacked into my account and purchased this phone, therefore I don't have a review..."
B06Y14T5YW,Victoria Boone,4,"BIXBY IS TERRIBLE! Every time I pull my phone out she says ""there are two ways you can find me."" There is no way to turn Bixby off, only silence her. This has driven me insane. Also, the screen protectors seem to pop off super easy on this phone. Mine came off the first week. Great camera, typical Samsung Galaxy, upgraded with all the bells and whistles."
B06Y14T5YW,Roadog66,3,"While it's very fast with a great screen, it can be a real pain at times. Apps pop up that I didn't call up. Bixby is just a pain and tries to interfere. It's small footprint is an illusion since the screen cracks easily so you must protect it with an Otter Box or some other armored case. It's hard to determine what's good about the phone since the carrier has a say in what comes with it. The best part is the camera, just great. At times I want to return to my old Motorola (Lenovo) Plus 4, big screen and battery life."
B06Y14T5YW,Andre_A,5,"As the new year approached, one of my goals was to try something different. I though, what better way to start off the new year than switch over to the Samsung Galaxy S8? As a Apple IOS user for over 10 years, I found the switch difficult and challenging, however, almost 2 weeks into using the Galaxy S8, I don't want to go back! I am very happy with the decision I've made to try out this device.

What I really liked about the Galaxy S8:

-Customizable: There is so much more customization I can do with the Galaxy S8 where I couldn't or was limited to do with other phones.

-The Infinity Display: When configured correctly, the S8 has a phenomenal colorful infinity display.

-Headphone Jack: As competitor brands are shift away from the headphone jack, I'm grateful Samsung decided to leave the headphone jack in the S8. The headphone jack becomes useful when I accidentally forget to charge my wireless headphones.

-Iris Scan: I enjoy the Iris scan as it is more accurate and reliable than the face recognition. No matter how many times I set up the face recognition, the device couldn't recognize my face. The iris scanner is more reliable with a faster response time.

-Finger Print Scanner: Though many Samsung users argue the finger print scanner is placed awkwardly in the back, I, a person w/ long fingers, enjoy it as I can easily reach the fingerprint scanner with one hand.

-Camera- When configured to the highest resolution i, in my opinion, the photos and videos on the S8 look phenomenal.

-Fast Charging- The S8 charges extremely fast! I purchased a wireless charger that also allows me to charge the S8!

Google Assistant- Real MVP- I use it everyday!

Cons:

Unfortunately, since the Galaxy S8's aspect ratio, l experience black bars around the screen. Though there is a option to fit the movie/video in the whole screen, it reduces the quality of the video.

The speaker on the galaxy S8 is very low compared to other devices. It's difficult watching a video or clip out in public.

Recommendations:
Purchase a screen protector to protect this beautiful 5.8 inch AMOLED Infinity Display Screen!
Purchase a case! Due to the phones glossy glass exterior, it's likely to get slippery and covered with finger prints. I use the OtterBox Commuter Series that I purchased through Amazon!
Customize your phone to your personality! Make it fun and interesting!
I'm constantly learning new features on the phone and I have so much more to learn!"
B06Y14T5YW,Miltspoon,4,"The phone,like most Samsung phones, works very well. It is very well built and great looking phone. However, I do not like the curved screen very well. Why I gave it 4 stars not five. Everything about this phone is great except the curved screen. I replaced an LG V20 and this phone is equal to it except for the screen. But I like the phone and think it is very nice. The camera is so nice and it shoots great video. It works well with my S3 tablet too. The only other thing I really do not like id Bixby. I wish it would just go away."
B06Y14T5YW,Jose R.,5,"I have had this phone since the day it came out. I am a poor college student but my phone that I had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. I waited to review this device because I wanted to run it through nursing clinical before I have it a good review.

1). This phone is a very practical size. It has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. The Super Amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.

2). Software and Performance: So we all know Samsung has had its software issues in the past. It is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. On top of that, still being on 7.0 Nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. They are improved versions of Android with much better battery optimizations. As far as Samsung Experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of Touchwiz. It is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. With that being said it still has stutter issues. Not lag but stutter. No lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. But it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. The Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of ram do enough however to power through everything. I have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. It has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. This phone does not fail me. I also game frequently and this device blows through it.

3). Camera: People and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. Hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. It is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. I use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. Clear as day even in dark conditions. Just a great great camera overall.

4)Battery: This has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. Some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. I personally get good battery life but not stellar. I keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what I paid for, and I get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. I wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. I have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.

5). Overall: This device is a solid overall package. I think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. A lot of people will be wondering if the Galaxy S8 should be dumped for the Not 8. I would say no. I would personally wait for the S9 or in my case the Note 9. This phone is basically a smaller Note 8 with a single rear camera and no S pen. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket the Note has nothing outrageous to offer in comparison."
B06Y14T5YW,DP,3,"I have galaxy s8 through Verizon. I liked the quality of craftsmanship, performance, and the slick appearance of the phone. However, its screen cracks so easily even with case put on. So be careful when you holding the phone to make sure you don't drop it. Otherwise, it will cost you for repair."
B06Y14T5YW,Jacob,3,"Okay so to start off Samsung made an incredibly beautiful device however next time they should spend more time working and the hardware functionality.

Software
My phone before the Samsung s8 was the nexus 6p. Needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of Samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. Touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part I found most annoying was Samsung's very own so, Bixby. Samsung even gave Bixby it's own button to access it but I found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. When I would use an ai it would always be Google assistant it seemed more practical than Bixby. Needless to say Bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.

Battery
The battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen. When default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery I would get around 4 hours of screen on time. When I changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness I was able to get through a whole day. The standby time on this phone is also great. My phone would have around 10% battery life before I went to sleep and when I would wake up it's only be at 8%.

Camera
Unlike most manufacturers Samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing. This is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). The back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iPhone 7. The selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause Samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie cam

Hardware
This is the area where I just did not have a good experience with this phone. For starters the fingerprint reader. I'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is. I had to same the same finger twice and I still can't unlock it on the first try. I am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint. The charging port was another issue I was having. Samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. I use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. I tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge. The other bad part of their hardware is that Bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.

Design
Overall the best part of this phone is the design. Samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match. The edge display just makes the display experience all the better."
B06Y14T5YW,Elle,2,"Very fast and feature-filled phone. Hardware delivers as promised and easily outshines iPhone. However, my phone screen cracked while I was in an airplane. The phone was not dropped or struck; it just started cracking from the bottom right corner while I was playing a game. The crack spread across the screen and was quite unsightly, but the phone was functional.

I contacted Samsung who offered for me to mail in the phone (for free) and they would examine the phone and see if there was any fault in the manufacturing. For $225 they would replace the screen if the cause was not found to be due to an underlying defect.

Well they just charged me and fixed the phone. I never heard anything or was given any sort of report in regards to whether or not this was a known manufacturing issue. I find that strange given their recent history with abnormal functioning phones.

The phone was shipped to me as promise by UPS but Samsung did not insure the package nor did they require a signature on delivery for this 850 dollar product. Alas, the package was swiped from my doorstep. I followed Samsung's instructions and filed with UPS and Samsung about the incident. One week later UPS concluded the package was delivered accurately (duh, I knew that). So Samsung REFILED with UPS stating it was stolen. I was reassured that this was the normal sequence of events (Odd?). Anyways, I'm now on week three without a phone that I didn't exactly consent to being repaired and definitely did not consent to be shipped uninsured and without signature on delivery. Everyone at Samsung has stayed on script and has been perfectly cordial, but their policies are not helpful in minimizing the inconvenience their defective product has cost me (time off from work, inability to perform work functions without a smart phone, etc...).

To conclude, an okay product without the company support to make it as awesome as it could be. Oh yeah, and a company with a track record of failing devices who still fails to perform thorough root-cause analyses on their products. At least with my n of 1.

Note: 2 stars because, prior to the phone randomly breaking, it was a solid product."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"Normally I would have given 5 stars because the phone works very well.
Samsung did an extremely LOUSY JOB with the fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint scanner is totally unusable for someone with somewhat larger hands. And I am not a big guy. Imagine a Caucasian man who does manual work. It will never work. The fingerprint scanner is made for children or women with very little hands.
The face recognition is also unreliable. Much less so, but still unreliable.
So, Samsung, someone did a very bad job here....."
B06Y14T5YW,Michael Andaloro,4,"Amazing phone. I bought mine from Costco, but I have not had any issues with my Galaxy. The 64 GB of storage is more than enough for my apps, photos and music. The battery life is exceptional and the fast charging adapter that comes with all Galaxy phones is amazing for quickly getting some juice while you are in a rush. Wireless charging is amazing in that I only need to set my phone down and it will begin charging. I switched from the iPhone 7 Plus and I do not see myself going back to Apple anytime soon."
B06Y14T5YW,cw,1,"Entirely too fragile, screen broke after phone dropped two feet in a case. First time I have ever cracked a screen and I have dropped other galaxy and Apple phones further with zero damage. Repairs are almost as much as a new phone, ridiculous....looking at several owner forums it seems to be a design flaw"
B06Y14T5YW,Petros Bezirganyan,2,"Let me start by saying that i owned almost all the Samsung Galaxy phones starting from s2, and i am a big Samsung fan. However the recent crop of Galaxy phones is left to be desired when it comes to the form factor and the screen. The biggest issue is with the AMOLED screen, which is oversaturated and suffers from back light shimmer especially around text. It suffers from poor white balance and contrast, as well as from Blu light bleeding around the curved edges. The font is noticably less sharp than on Apple's retina displays, and whites are almost gray... Very bad rendition of AMOLED technology, IMHO...
Second biggest problem with the latest Galaxy lineup is the elongated form factor which is very hard to use with one hand, as well as view content in landscape mode. Not all applications support the ultra wide screen format, and the contents looks odd in a very short but wide viewing area...

Also not insignificant the fact that the phone is literally very slick, and can easily slip out ones hands. The galaxy back cover of the case feels fragile, and the phone simply requires a case to have any semblance of durability. It is literally superslick and fragile... Huge design problem...and this is not to mention that especially in black it is a fingerprint magnet...

It is a shame, sine the phone is really a good performer and has a good battery life... and I really love Samsung's latest rendition of it's TouchWiz Android experience...

I bought this phone unlocked from BestBuy thinking I would fall in love with it, but unfortunately I had to return it on the third day at a penalty. I do not recommend this phone, especially at its current high price point..."
B06Y14T5YW,Parafume Toilette,1,"Weakest screen I've had on a phone. I had a Note7 and the screen was indestructible. When I brought it back to the store during the recall, after they refunded me they started throwing the phone to see how much force it could take before breaking. The store employees were tossing it high in the air and it would fall on their hardwood floor unscathed. They eventually got it to break after many, many throws but it withstood SO MUCH before finally shattering. I assumed the S8+ would have the same gorilla glass as the Note7. Nope! In fact, the S8+ has one of the most fragile screens out of any recently released phone. Look it up. Mine fell out of my pocket about 1.5 ft and shattered, also damaging the LCD itself. Additionally, I recently got an ""offer"" from Samsung as a Note7 owner to trade my phone in for a Note8-- they offered me ""up to $450"" for a phone that I paid significantly more for. This will probably be my last Samsung phone after my recent experiences with their products."
B06Y14T5YW,David Rhodes,5,"This phone lives up to my expectations. One nice thing Samsung did was include multiple USB cable type adapters to make the transition to USB C less painful for those who have micro USB cables. Setup was easy, and with a T Mobile SIM from my less than flattering G6, booted right up and started working with the network. Build quality seems to be good.
Bixby is interesting, and works about as well as Google's voice activation, if not slightly better, it at least tells you when it can't do something, and has a nice tutorial when you first swipe to its screen on the phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Saidso17,1,"This phone is amazing but has one massive flaw. The edge to edge screen, while it looks and performs amazingly is the downfall of this device. You will break this phone.

You could put a case on it to protect the glass edges. However, the case will only be effective if it is also covering the edges of the screen that your phone will fall on when you drop it. So if the only way to realistically use this phone without having to replace it every time you drop it is to cover the main feature, the edge to edge screen with a case. So what is the point of the phone? Save your heartache with cracked screans and invest in any of the competitors that won't shatter on the first drop."
B06Y14T5YW,Duchess,5,"This is my very first Smartphone and I love it so far. Just for calling, texting, checking emails and taking photos, it's terrific, but that's all I have sampled so far. From what I understand from my other, more ""tech-savvy"" smartphone-owing pros, this is great. Will advise if anything changes after i've had it for more than one month, but I don't foresee that happening. Just love it. OH- I specifically got an unblocked phone so I could shop around (I'm in Florida). I decided on Verizon, but they were unable to make this phone compatible with their system. Something about CDMA vs. GSM."
B06Y14T5YW,Hector,1,"Problems with the phone within two weeks, terrible experience with Samsung in Warranty repair who sent the phone whithout the simcard tray and 20 days later still not here. If your product stop working consider this advice, Samsung Warranty Services is terrible. My Phone is 4 month old and thanks to them i got to enjoy it for 10 days. I don't know when I'm going to be able to used again."
B06Y14T5YW,Jeffrey C,5,"My wife upgraded from a fairly old phone (the Nexus 5), so this was a huge leap to the next generation for sure! The photos it takes completely rivals any other phone I've seen (including my S7!) and not to mention it even seems sharper than my friends' iPhone pics. The phone, albeit on the large side, has an absolutely GORGEOUS screen and makes browsing and interacting an absolute pleasure every time it is fired up. Only drawback is that it's very difficult for one handed operations, but I'm not going to ding the number of stars for that because my wife knew what she was getting herself signed up for when purchasing such a large phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,"I bought this phone unlocked from another source. I was a Nexus phone user and was happily into my Nexus 5x usage for 1.5 years and it went into a bootloop (a known issue). I had to have a phone immediately so bought an S8.

Pros;
- Beautiful design, screen is awesome
- I like how Samsung shows battery percent and data up/download in the status bar
- Battery life seems pretty good
- MicroSD card capability
Cons:
- Screen design (curve) means much easier to break/damage, even with a case
- Bixby button is easy to hit, a pain. Samsung has prevented owners from remapping it.
- Volume buttons above Bixby button, way too high
- FINGERPRINT READER location sucks, and shape sucks too. My Nexus had it right - center back, big pad and easy quick recognition
- Samsung Touchwiz launcher is better than old days, but still why mess up vanilla Android? Splitscreen mode not as intuitive as vanilla Android. Home screen has much wasted space as second row of icons goes well above tray, wasting space. I ended up downloading the Google Launcher and that made a huge difference
- Camera is surprisingly not as good as Nexus 5x, especially in low light (this is same camera as in Nexus 6p, and current Pixel

I called Google and even though my 5x is out of warranty, they are shipping me a refurb 5x free! So I am going to pay the restocking charge and return the Galaxy S8, and wait for the Google Pixel 2. Samsung has the name recognition but IMHO this phone is not as good as people think. Google's service was excellent and I'm happy to continue with them where I always have the latest OS and latest security updates as soon as they come out."
B06Y14T5YW,michelle,1,"I have been a loyal Samsung customer for many years. However, that has come to a screeching halt. My Galaxy S8+ stopped working one night. I did not damage it in any way. Went to bed and it was fine, got up the next morning and could not connect to any network. Went to AT&T for help, they worked the problem for a bit , it was finally decided it had to be sent in to Samsung. They received my phone on Aug 8. They did not even open the box until Aug 13. I received emails from them that day that said this would be repaired in warranty at no cost to me and that the phone would be fixed in 5 business days. That was the last I heard from them. I, however, have reached out to them countless times now. I keep getting shuffled between repair support, customer support and executive customer support ( which by the way means nothing). I have spent over 7 hours total time on the phone with them, been hung up on, lied to about different department availability, spoken rudely to, put on hold for outrageous amounts of time. Finally today find out that my phone has been ""repaired"" twice now since sent in and has failed both of its quality control tests. Now it is being repaired a 3rd time and will have to go through ""quality control"" again. There is NO timeframe given for how long this might take. I have been told repeatedly that NO ONE there can make a decision to replace or refund a phone. I run a small business and I depend on this phone every day. It has been over 3 weeks since I've had it.....and there is NO care whatsoever from Samsung. Be assured, I will let everyone know that I possibly can about this horrible and unfair customer service. SHAME ON YOU SAMSUNG....this family will NEVER purchase another product from this company."
B06Y14T5YW,Honest Opinion,5,"It's easily my best phone so far. The screen is really nice. The form factor is a great surprise. It's very easy to hold.

The phone also has a great camera that is better than on any previous phone, a Nexus 5X.

My biggest concern with Samsung phones was it's software, especially after coming from a pure Google phone. I have been pleasantly surprised how nice Samsungs have gotten. In many ways it is nicer to use than a pure Google phone.

The battery life is great and so is the speed and the usability. In all its a great phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"So this is the first time I have actually bought a flagship device from Samsung all my previous ones were of the other variety however I can say this is hands down the best device I've had to date.
Pros:
1. The price, considering the device usually goes for 700-800 USD getting in at 574.99 is a very good deal, this was the factor that made me get it over an iPhone.
2. The camera and video quality is AWESOME. I've never had pics looking this great.
3. Its super fast like the boot up was effortless and switching between apps is a breeze.
4. Since all my previous devices were 1GB RAM and 8 GB memory having one now that is 4GB RAM and 64GB memory its an eye opener plus having expandable storage with an SD card just won my heart.
5. Battery life is great. I can go one day without charging with moderate to high usage which is good.
6. The speakers are loud AF like I was shocked when listening to Youtube videos.

Cons:
1. The finger print scanner, this should be a common cry at the moment but its is placed at possibly the most inconvenient place for a finger print scanner.
2. The phone is made entirely of glass which for me is a concern cause i'm a klutz so I recommend getting a good case and a Tempered Glass screen protector.

FYI: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. I am using it in Jamaica right now and it works perfectly fine.

I would recommend this phone to anyone because it has good internal and build quality. So this was just my two cents.Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black)"
B06Y14T5YW,Nathan Taunton,1,"I have this phone and it is now less than 4 weeks old. Overnight as it was charging it came up with a moisture detection message and it won't charge. It has not been in water although it claims to be ""water resistant"". The bubble gum answer of use a blow dryer or clean with a Qtip are not working and again, it hasn't been in water. If the humidity in the air can render a phone less than a month old unusable it is worthless. Move on to a better option because as you can see on the forum sites, people all over are experiencing the problem. It is either a hardware or software problem. The consensus seems to be that it became a problem after the last system update."
B06Y14T5YW,Redmond James Guevarra,5,"Out of all the smart phones Ive used in my life Samsung has always made the best impression. The apple ecosystem has always been strong competition however the battery life on the iPhone was always ridiculous which makes no sense because their macbook pro batteries are incredible. Also since the macbook pro and the samsung S8 both use usb -c, in my opinion they make a better combination. Lets face it, everyone has a macbook pro. The Pixel 2XL seems to be the only real competitor for the S8 but the bezel is way too thick compared to the S8's invisible edge. The only real downside to this phone is the placement of the fingerprint scanner but you can always config facial or retina recognition. Alternatively, you can try out the S9 which is basically the same phone but the fingerprint scanner is reachable by your double jointed swan neck deformed stubbs. Visit planet-red.net to see pictures i took of my dog on the S8 camera. The quality is THICCC. 10 out of 10, would recommend this baddie."
B06Y14T5YW,FeralGeek,1,This phone sucks. It keeps freezing and having errors and is unusable. I have not had a phone for months as Scamsung keeps refreshing the software and sending it back to me. No one at Scamsung will honor the warranty. Last Scamsung product i will ever buy.
B06Y14T5YW,Beckaroo,5,Love this phone! It is definitely an upgrade from my S5. It has a great camera. It is really cool to switch to selfie mode just by swiping the photo area. It like flips. I really like the edge. It is a really neat feature. It is also water resistant and can be immersed in water. So I can set it on the edge of the tub and not have to worry if I may accidentally knock it into the water. It does have a limit though. Read the manual. It is very user friendly just as all Samsung Galaxies are. I know there is so much more I could tell you but just know it is a great phone overall.
B06Y14T5YW,Tyler,5,"I got to put my phones water resistence to the test this summer. While working on my boat my phone slid out of my pocket, I assumed it had gone overboard and into the big blue. It turned out that it slid out while I was selling fish and went to my processing boat in a bag of salmon. My phone then spend the next 2-3 days at the bottom of a fish hold with a few thousand lbs of fish and refrigerated Sea water. When they pumped out one of their deckhands found the phone at the bottom, threw it in a bag of rice and got it back to me. Worked great, some sound issues at first with the ear speaker but it corrected it self. I dont know if it was luck or good engineering, or both. I figured I needed to give them a review after getting back a working phone from all that. Great camra, good data storage the phone is pretty average after that."
B06Y14T5YW,Alexis Trotman,3,"Theoretically speaking, overall this phone is dreadful. Pros are the variety of security features (face recognition, iris scanner and fingerprint scanner) and the option to choose themes. However, the cons definitely outweighed the pros. The cons that were definitely obvious to me were the lack of battery life, the poor picture quality (an iPhone 6s has a better camera than this phone) and constant updates. I have had this phone since September of 2018 and I am not happy with it. Just a heads up if you are looking into purchasing this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Mike K.,2,"Wife recently purchased thru ATT authorized store. She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either. Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide."
B06Y14T5YW,Mohammad,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is extremely helpful with all the features it provides and while also looking really beautiful at the same time. With its Snapdragon 835 Processor it allows the phone to run appropriately fast, and allows the user to be able to run most programs that couldn't be run on previous generations. With that and the four gigabytes of ram the new Samsung Galaxy S8 allows for two windows to be up on the same time; this allows for great multitasking. Even though the internals of the S8 are powerful, the externals are just as good or even better. The Galaxy S8 is by far one of the sleekest phones out there with its infinity screen and beveled edge. The screen it has gives it more real estate which allows it to give a nice wide angle view and look amazing on most applications. While the beveled double edge looks really nice it also is a very useful addition because it gives you the option for an incognito quick menu.this menu has an ever growing amount of possibilities; because it holds more than your top 5 contacts and your top 10 apps. There is a whole selection of extra pages for your bar ranging from far more than a notepad or a full on calculator which can come in handy for real quick math in the samsung app store. The galaxy s8 has one of the best battery lives, for it can last nearly a whole day on a full charge with general use. It also is very durable even though the whole body is made of glass it can sure take a massive beating as well as its water resistant. The S8 has so many features that its hard to mention them all but it is one of the best, if not the best, phone out on the market right now."
B06Y14T5YW,Raph84,1,"I purchased this phone on a Monday, by Thursday the back was cracked. I never dropped it, I never bumped it, I never even put it in my pocket with anything else. When I contacted Samsung they said that I could send it back and be without a phone for a week, and then they would determine if it was a manufacturing defect (and fix it) or decide that it was user abuse (and they would charge me to fix it or return it broken). Since this interaction, it is clear to me that Samsung does not stand behind their products, and that they do not care about customer satisfaction."
B06Y14T5YW,Jeff Lynne is Genius,3,"beautiful display but then there is Bixby. why samsung? they really want to be intrusive I guess! most annoying thing ever, even more than the wrap edges... butt dials like you have never seen except it is opening all kinds of things in my back pocket so be sure to lock bone the display. display is gorgeous, battery life solid after a few months yay!- and it gives warnings if moisture sensed in charging port. nice. beautiful phone and great camera but annoying as heck sometimes."" Honest Opinion""
put a nice true review I think"
B06Y14T5YW,Kelly Eastman,5,"I already had an S8 that I got through Verizon so I knew I liked the phone. It's sleek and beautiful and is practically my personal assistant. I wasn't sure if this unlocked version would be simple to activate, but we took the Verizon SIM card out of my daughter's dying S6 and put it in the S8 and it works perfectly, calls, texts, apps, etc. We didn't even have to go online to activate it! And if she wants to switch carriers, she can just get a new SIM card. This unlocked phone is the way to go."
B06Y14T5YW,Kevin,1,"It's hard to express how disappointed I am with this phone. The hardware is incredibly fragile and without a very bulky case the screen will inevitably break sooner rather than later. After 5 months the battery is losing its life already. The software is just as bad. The keyboard is jumpy and the autocorrect is always giving me terrible suggestions and sometimes just clears what I've typed entirely for no apparent reason. Bixby is constantly trying to insert itself into my life when I have no interest in it. Apps are constantly crashing and the performance of the phone is generally underwhelming, making it frustrating to use. It's one redeeming quality was that it was waterproof, however I doubt it still is now that the screen is cracked. If I was able to, I would go back to my s5, which was a much higher quality phone in my opinion."
B06Y14T5YW,family man,4,"This phone is pretty good!

Water resistant. Solid build quality. Battery lasts a decent amount of time compared to my iphone 7 I got rid of. Charges very quickly.

Interface/operating system could be easier to use. Siri is easy. This bixby character is difficult. Hope it gets updated soon to make it much better. Needs it!"
B06Y14T5YW,Mina,1,This is my last Samsung product after having had 3 previously. I have to update my phone every year due to issues that fall just outside of warranty and it's getting to be a very expensive habit.
B06Y14T5YW,Shawn,5,"I didn't buy my S8+ from Amazon, but I did buy it unlocked. And if you try to activate it with a network under their Bring Your Own Device provisions, you need to ask for an ISIM card. CSIM and USIM type SIM cards will not work."
B06Y14T5YW,Percy,1,The glass on my phone broke while it was in a case in my pocket. You can't find repairs at a reasonable price anywhere making the phone effectively a paper weight. I will not purchase another device from Samsung again.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a smart choice for a smartphone. This phone serves all the purposes you would expect in a modern smartphone and does so tremendously well. With a 3500 mAh battery, it lasts all day displaying all your information, entertainment, and communication needs on a beautiful edge to edge screen with a 6.2ââ Quad HD+ Super AMOLED technology with a easy to use UI (user Interface).

As someone, who has been on #teamiPhone for the last 5 years making the switch was not an easy choice but after analyzing the market and realizing that now in the Fall of 2017 is the perfect time to switch markets. I switched markets and I am enjoying the S8 + more than I ever did a new generation iPhone. After letting my mom (a baby boomer) play with this new phone, it became quite clear that she could operate it with about the same level of competency as her iPhone 6+ running the latest OS. Granted, there is a steeper learning curve for older generations with newer technologiesâ¦

I think it is safe to say that anyone at any age could operate the S8+ with ease and learn to enjoy life on the other side of the smartphone market. You should consider researching it further learning more about itâs incredible durability, waterproofing, and hardware specs."
B06Y14T5YW,Jeffrey Allen,1,Do your research and you will see this is the most breakable phone ever. Mine cracked twice .... Without dropping ... Even though I have the Samsung case designed to protect it. Great phone but that $200 monthly deductible will drive you broke (no pun intended)!
B06Y14T5YW,Ryuushen,5,"She accidentally lost the phone 8 days ago at around full charge she said. She found it today and said it was still 4% when she picked it up at the barn. Nough said, Best phone ever."
B06Y14T5YW,Arianna Yu,5,"Beautiful, sleek design. I mainly use this device for messaging and playing fps mobile games, and don't notice any lagging issues due to the phone processor. Lagging is typically from a fluctuating wifi connection. Touch sensitivity is perfect, even with a screen protector. Apps open quickly. Use headphones, because phone speakers are not comparable to your surround sound system. I'd highly recommend getting a case and screen protector, as the entire phone is encased in glass, which makes the device prone to cracks."
B06Y14T5YW,Zack Fedorovich,3,"If the device gives you the periodic urge to smash it into a solid object, you should not continue to own that device.
The problem comes from the overly sensative moisture detection firmware. If you live in a humid climate, you are bound to get the ""moisture detected in the chargin port"" warning; even if the device has not been in direct contact with liquid.
Despite much effort to clean and dry the charging port, followed by clearing the cache memory and even doing a factory reset; the issue will sometimes persist.
The otherwise excellent device is too expensive to be unreliable."
B06Y14T5YW,Diego Garcia,5,Best Phone I have ever used or owned!!!! it took a little bit to figure out how to connect with metro pcs but it works beautifully
B06Y14T5YW,Stephanie Lehman,1,"I've had my phone since maybe August. I immediately put a screen protector and case on the thing. Screen has two cracks, and it's not worth paying Verizon my deductible to get another just like it. The edge screen is not protected well by any case I've tried, so that's where cracks form. Also, it's impossible to get a decent screen protector that sits well on the screen if you're using a case. I am terribly disappointed."
B06Y14T5YW,Kingdom of Geek,2,"I fully expected this device to be bloatware free. It's not. Even when you ""disable"" the app there are services from that app still running in the background. One of the worst offenders is Facebook. Even if you're not on Facebook, and have disabled it, it is still running in the background."
B06Y14T5YW,Xin Cai,2,"I had a Nexus 6p, but it stopped working and I didn't want to fork out the money for a Pixel 2 so I decided to get the Sumsung S8 plus as part of Tmobiles buy one get one free deal. BOY WAS IT A MISTAKE. The Galaxy S8 is complete junk compare to my Nexus 6p. First of all the fingerprint reader is right NEXT to the camera!!! So it's very easy to mistake the Camera for the finger print reader when you are not looking and it usually takes me several tries to unlock the phone. Second the phone only have one speaker on the bottom compare to the stereo speaker in my 6p. And YES it does make a difference!! Third, the curve screen completely sucks, it warps videos and side of webpages and ebook. Lastly as of today, it still doesn't have support for the latest android software while my 6p already supported it. In all honesty if I had to choose all over again I would have chosen the LG V30 or Pixel 2 or IPhone X. Heck I would've chosen my old 6p over this phone. So yes please stay away from this phone, it's definitely not worth the price."
B06Y14T5YW,com2015,4,"IPhone user for years, I decided to give this a try. Very stable and solid phone with awesome screen resolution and security enhancements. The iris log in is just one example. No pins, no passwords to enter. So far I am well pleased and do not miss my IPhone at all"
B06Y14T5YW,Timo,2,"This phone is reliable.. but that's all I like about it. It's smooth, slippery, glass front and back, and is quite possibly the most fragile thing I've ever touched. If you frequently venture far from the safety of your bed, or someplace afflicted by the ravages of gravity, this device is the wrong choice."
B06Y14T5YW,R. Jones,5,"I am going to review what I consider the most important features of a phone.

Screen (5/5): literally, the most beautiful display I have ever seen. At first, I wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it I was already questioning if I could ever go back to a normal flat screen. It's awesome.

Battery (5/5): I put this thing through its paces. The first few days I used Youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. To make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. I think the lowest I've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some Youtube videos) is like 40%.

Storage (5/5): Pretty simple to review this. 64GB is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microSD card.

Call clarity (4/5): At first, I didn't realize I had the HD Calling feature on. This made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, I didn't like it. After I switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best I've heard. By no means is it bad, just not the best,

Feel (4/5): It's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. I have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but I can see why this might become an issue for others.

Speaker quality (5/5): I was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. Don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the S8's sound is above average.

Feel (5/5): This thing is sleek. I bought a minimalist case for it because I loved the way it felt in my hand. A few times, I had a moment of panic because I couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. If you are prone to dropping your phone, I suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. I have not dropped mine yet, but I can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it. The screen is supposedly pretty tough, but I wouldn't test it.

If I think of more things to review I will update this, but for now I think that's all I have to say about the Samsung S8. Overall, I've never felt more impressed by a new phone"
B06Y14T5YW,SpoonOfFate,1,"It's the phone that phone repair stores love!

I've owned cell phones since 1995. Before I bought the S8, I had broken exactly zero screens. In the year that I've had the S8, I have broken the screen three times, and the glass back once. No case can protect it sufficiently, although to be fair I have not yet tried a foam-padded aluminum briefcase handcuffed to my wrist.

If you live in an area that has gravity, I strongly recommend that you select a different device."
B06Y14T5YW,Jeff,3,"The phone performs great. I mean really. I haven't had any performance issues since buying the phone. The problem is the curved screen. You absolutely cannot find a good glass screen protector for this phone. If you get the soft plastic ones they'll work but hardly prevent cracked screens from drops. The hard glass protectors will always either leave dead spots on the edges or fall off within a week. Often times both. This is a design flaw if you're prone to dropping your phone or work outside of an office. Again, the phone works great"
B06Y14T5YW,Anaika,1,Worst biometrics. Not user friendly at all
B06Y14T5YW,Nondies_82,4,I purchased the phone and I transferred my data from my s7 in turn it made the phone not function properly. It wouldn't read my sim card. The volume bottom was not working so I couldn't hear conversations unless I had the phone on speaker. Two days of this and I did a master reset. Phone is working now but the in call volume is still an issue. I would have loved to have everything transfer over without an issue. The phones camera is so awesome though. It's super clear! The split screen makes me love this phone. Samsung over Apple for sure. I was unsure when I originally switched but the pros outweigh the cons. The expandable memory is a huge plus! I'm sure as I get more familiar with this phone I'll learn to love it 100%
B06Y14T5YW,K. Green,1,The screen on this phone gets horrible reviews and I wish we knew that before we got it. Even with a good protective case it broke
B06Y14T5YW,alfios,3,"Hasnt infrared port
The screen is too long, but not so height"
B06Y14T5YW,Izzy,1,"Paying almost 900 dollars for a phone and then some for a case you'd think it wouldn't break. My screen has shattered twice now. I've never broken a phone before in my life. I've never dropped this phone either. One minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. It was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. I never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. I pull out the phone and it's shattered. I'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. TWICE. If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is absurd. I want my money back."
B06Y14T5YW,John,2,"Two stars because a phone this expensive should be an upgrade, not a problem. This phone has trouble casting to Chromecast through the Home app (sound, no pic) and has trouble connecting to bluetooth. I cannot connect it to my Pioneer system in my truck. It will not pair. A quick search revealed this is a common problem with this model."
B06Y14T5YW,WildBill,2,"Bixby, is new voice assistant from samsung, that can't be deleted. if you like alexis, and google voice, now you have a new voice command. if you don't want that, tough.

the extra button on the left side will activate Bixby, and can not be deactivated -per samsung tech support. I can't recommend this phone because of bixby."
B06Y14T5YW,BH,2,The phone gets scratches way too easily. This might be the last Samsung I buy.
B06Y14T5YW,Chris Nevers,1,"Came from jailbroken iPhone because I thought I could do whatever I want with my android after I bought it, such as rooting. Samsung apparently didn't get the memo of what android stands for, user customizability. Rooting is damn near impossible on this crappy phone. This phone misses on all the little things I didn't appreciate on my iphone. These things include actually sending music metadata to my car over Bluetooth, not unlocking my phone everytime Bluetooth makes and ends a call, not unlocking my phone when I miss a call."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,3,"looks cool, has a bunch of crazy features, good camera and video. BUT the screen/key pad is HORRIBLE. I can barely even use the letters H and T when writing. I have to push H and T about 15 times before it finally works. also the text prediction/swype is horrible. I.O.T is not a word I use but is always being suggested among other gibberish words because the letters H and T don't work so they aren't recognized when trying to swype words. I got the phone free for work so I cant complain too much but if I had my choice I would go back to the Motorola Droid Turbo in a second."
B06Y14T5YW,Hyun Mo Yang,2,The phone itself keeps rebooting and restarting every 3 min or so for NO REASON at all just like some LG phones which did irritated me whileago... plus Did I even mention this particular device is too fragile and super duper susceptible to cracking? Yup.. in the other reviews despite its own beautiful designs and so far no battery explosion issues after Note 7 fiasco way back in September 2016 aka They did develop 8 points battery safety check. T hats one star I just added......
B06Y14T5YW,Kelly Novak,1,"So disappointed in this phone. The bezeled edge makes it difficult to hit certain buttons, ads are popping up all of the time. Just not a good phone, so many things have changed, and in a bad way. Things just disappear off of the screen, ie, phone call, alarm, music, and I can't get them back easily. Just plain sucks!!!! Been using for about 3 months now and wish I had purchased an iphone. Have been an Android fan for about a decade. Definitely will next time."
B06Y14T5YW,Tom Ewald,1,"If you don't mind surrendering your integrity by lying, saying you've read the thousands of legal words about Bixby, you can use the app. OTOH, if you prefer to retain your integrity (but don't want to spend the time to read all of that), it remains unusable, but will pop up anyway every time you accidentally hit the physical button toward the middle of the left side of the phone. There were ways to remap this with apps, but Samsung apparently got around that with the latest update, showing their complete disdain for their customers. This is not my first Samsung, but will probably be my last."
B06Y14T5YW,AmazonCustomer,4,Love This phone. Was a little hard to type with the curved screen at first. I kept bumping letters with the sides of hands while hanging on to the phone. I recommend a case for it. Once I put that on I didn't have any more problems because now my hands are resting on the case and not on the actual screen. I use an otter box.
B06Y14T5YW,Fish,1,I am really disappointed that this phone just stopped working exactly after one year. I have never dropped this phone but I remember recently every time I use the call swap functionality it freezes but this time it stopped for good. I took it to technicians they opened it they checked battery and all but no fix. Money wasted.
B06Y14T5YW,Adewale,4,"Definitely one of the best of 2017.

Not giving 5star because Samsung chose to play safe with quick charge 2.0 rather than using a more recent iteration"
B06Y14T5YW,Supreme Overlord of the Earth (aka Jon),2,"This is a great phone let down by one major flaw of a super scratchy screen. I have had an S3 and and S5 in the past and this was a step up. I love the display, the memory, the speed, and the color. If it was just for that I would have given this phone 5 stars. I have had this phone for only 3 days and there is already a bunch of scratches on the screen. And deep enough to pick up with your fingernail. I never had this problem with the previous Samsung phones. In fact I went caseless for the entire 2 year life of the S5 and only picked up one scratch when it fell to the floor of the truck once. I haven't treated this phone any different and have not dropped it or otherwise abused it but there are still noticeable scratches and marks. This alone makes the phone a ""DO NOT BUY"" in my book. Maybe if it was HALF THE PRICE but not at over $600. I seriously think that the screen isn't even glass but PLASTIC. A big step backward for Samsung."
B06Y14T5YW,Mpop,4,I wish i had bought one that wasnt unlocked. It prevents me from seeing voicemail and only allows me to swipe to open in one direction and doesnt always allow auto direction of screen. My screen broke first time i dropped it. I have a case on it but not the greatest( obviously :( )it still works but im sure its not waterproof any longer.
B06Y14T5YW,Ronald Lic,5,Great phone but had to return. I have T-mobile and this unlocked doesn't do video calling and predictive text only branded T-mobile devices do this.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,"Best phone I've had yet! Beautiful display and advanced features. It takes beautiful pictures, has fast charge and long lasting battery life. Charged My phone once and didn't have to charge it again for two to three days and that was with me being on it a lot. My last phone was the lg flex and I wasn't as big on it so I decided to go back to Samsung again and my am I happy with my decision. Would recommend anyone to definitely give this phone a go. It's pretty expensive but it's worth it. Great phone!"
B06Y14T5YW,C. Heron,1,"The phone is fine, but god help you if you have a customer service issue. Absolutely the worst! That's saying something with companies like Comcast in existence, but Samsung takes the cake. They ignore you as long as humanly possible (do not reply at all--let alone in the 24 hours they promise to). If you do manage to get in touch with them, they'll transfer you 4-5 times before telling you the department you need is closed. I pay AT&T $32 a month for this so I'm stuck, but I will NEVER purchase another Samsung product as long as I live and I recommend you don't either--they don't care about theit customers at all."
B06Y14T5YW,brandon,5,Nice phone I'm so glad I bought here and saved over 400 dollars vs verizon... just keep in mind you can't get voicemail notifications but as far as price can't beat even allowed me to do payments no credit check or interest! Awesome
B06Y14T5YW,CHettwer,2,"Some of these good reviews sound like they were written by Samsung employees or sellers. Seriously. This has to be one of the worst Samsung phones I've ever purchased (I've had 4 different versions over the last six years). The swipe feature used when texting will more often than not pick an odd or nonexistent word instead of the one you want. The voice to text feature is almost useless. You seriously can't tell it you want a comma placed? On my old phone you could. And even yelling clearly results in almost half the wrong words. Both of these features have gone backwards at least 2 generations. As usual battery life sucks. If you play any games and use your phone what I consider to be a pretty normal amount throughout the day, the charge won't even last the day. I'm typically recharging it around 4 pm so I have a full charge before I go out at night. The touch response is terrible and often I have to hit the screen several times to get it to select what I want (this MAY partially be a result of the Gadget Guard Black Ice Screen Guard which is glass and cracks super easily). And while the infinity screen offers a nice view of pictures and videos, any normal person that holds onto their phone will naturally touch the side and the phone allows this to select random things and jump away from whatever you were doing. I'm not an apple fan at all (even though my husband and son are trying to convert me), I just wish Samsung would get it together so I'm not swearing at the damn thing everyday. All this money and I wish I had my S6 back. Frustrating."
B06Y14T5YW,Adam B,5,"S8+ is a really well made phone and has a nice feel when you hold it in your hand. Recommend taking Accident protection plan. The much criticized Bixby is not too bad and you need to spend time to train your assistant, after that it works great. Never expected another company to beat Apple in build quality, looks and intuitive interface....Samsung S8+ proved me wrong.... love the phone"
B06Y14T5YW,Todd J. Krager,4,"The only thing about this phone I don't like is bixby. The placement of the button is such that every time I picked up the phone, I was hitting the button and activating it. It is annoying as hell! I finally found out how to deactivate the entire app and the button, now I love my phone!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Pocket,1,"Phone features are good but durability is horrendous. Glass is way too fragile! Phone fell on carpet (with case) and screen cracked. This is my forth Samsung S5, S6, S7 & S8 and the others held up well. Consider the cost to repair and or insurance + cost of phone! Very disappointing."
B06Y14T5YW,James Boatwright,2,"I actually bought this through BestBuy and I absolutely loved it for the first year, but right after it came out of warranty a really nasty screen burn manifested and fixing it costs like $300"
B06Y14T5YW,cold in the dakotas,3,"I had a galaxy 4 and was due for an upgrade. It needed a new battery too. So decided to get an 8 plus. There are more days than not that I think I should get a new battery for my 4 and use that. I do like some of the upgrades from the 4, love love love the camera but this phone can have a mind of its own."
B06Y14T5YW,Scott Bond,2,"It is an ok phone nice features but Samsung used poorly made screens on this phone. I have had S3, 5, 7 and now 8 and the 8 is scratch every other day its seems like. The glass is either fake or they just used junk glass to make up for their loses last year.

I would not recommend you spend this amount of money on a sub-par Smart Phone, poor craftsmanship."
B06Y14T5YW,Mtntrekker01,1,"If you're considering a Samsung S8+ just know, my phone has terrible burn-in on the AMOLED screen. Just went a week without the phone while it went back to Samsung for repair. I got it back and there's dirt behind the screen. They now want the phone back again. Terrible customer service"
B06Y14T5YW,Genna D,1,"I can describe this entire review as: this will be my LAST samsung phone and no I will never recommend ANY samsung phone.

First, positive points:
* Camera is great (I personally think its better at taking pictures under more difficult lighting conditions than iphone 8plus).
* USB-C connector
* Wireless charging
* OLED display (minus the curved screen)

Negative,
* Samsung is terrible about providing OS updates, (at least a year behind everyone else, just pathetic, considering it was a top of the line phone..
* Curved screen, just the worst design period, tempered glass screen protectors do not stay on for more than 5 days.
* Bixby button is placement is terrible and gets triggered very often
* You can't disable bixby button or remap-it to something that is actually useful
* Very fragile, my screen broke when phone fell down in a car from less than a foot height (hit the seat rail).
* The repair cost is insane, I payed 250 to get the screen replaced at (ubreakifix, samsung official repair center), I had to get it repaired 3 times; on top of it, the third time I had to bring it I had to drive 220 miles (round trip), before everything was working like its supposed to (first screen, after repair microphone would not work, then phone jack stopped working). The last repair technician said, that I should be very cautious about getting this phone wet as it has likely its not going to hold. I should have just cut my losses, payed a bit extra and just get the new iphone 8plus.

Overall very disappointed in samsung phones..."

B06Y14T5YW,Kevin,1,"on top of screen burn in issues, my galaxy s8 spontaneously failed after only a year of use. avoid this brand if possible."
B06Y14T5YW,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!,3,Great phone but has few cons comes with it. It gets scratch very easy; from front to back. So get a screen protector and a case *asap* if not you will regret it. I sure did.
B06Y14T5YW,J. Fior,5,I was skeptical but I love it!! I use it with Straight Talk and works perfectly! ð
B06Y14T5YW,idris ko,1,"The phone over heats way too much and after five months of using the phone it stopped working, so i won't advise anyone to buy it"
B06Y14T5YW,ChRiStIan JoYnEr,1,The screen literally cracks so easily.
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,"The phone itself is fine. The form factor is in line with most modern phones. The biggest issue with Samsung's phone is their software. Incredibly slow update times to the latest operating system, resulting in users dealing with a sluggish user experience since they're using an older operating system.

You can do better at this price point. Just go buy a One Plus if you want cheaper or Google Pixel for better updates."
B06Y14T5YW,VR,1,Not happy with this phone. The incoming/outgoing calls have issues. Any call after 2 mins the audio is gone. The other person cannot hear me but i can hear them. Please do not buy this version of the phone. Waste of money. Googled and found that there are lot of people going thru this issue without a fix. Need to call amazon about returning.
B06Y14T5YW,Josh Lawrence,1,"0 stars. This is the rube goldberg of cell phones. Idk who is giving this phone more than 1 star other than because you have to give at least one. Everything wrong with this phone in a nutshell- bixby button, misplaced fingerprint scanner, misplaced speaker, annoying side tab on edge of screen- oh and it's really expensive. I promise you will not like this phone- unless you drive slow in the passing lane."
B06Y14T5YW,Richard E. Jacobs,1,"This is the worst NON apple phone ever. It is very slick and difficult to handle, resulting in it frequently crashing to the floor. I have used several apps that require the phone to be rest by removing frquently the battery--something that cannot be done with the S8. The curved screen results in apps too often being opened inadvertently. There appears to be no way to disable Bixby and the button is in a very difficult spot to avoid--extremely annoying. Much of the functionality of previous devices is gone or virtually impossible to find. Worst of all, IT CAME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!!!! THIS WILL BE MY LAST SAMSUNG PHONE."
B06Y14T5YW,Joseph,2,"It is almost perfect phone except that stupid Edge Screen which makes almost impossible to put screen protector and cause unwanted touch.
Samsung. Please remove that feature."
B06Y14T5YW,Brent E. Owens,5,"Excellent all around. Customizable

Usb c port broke within months. Can only wirelessly charge now."
B06Y14T5YW,Austin,1,The phone itself is pretty good and have had the phone about a month ans i was in class and dropped it fell out od my pocket and the screen shattered. I have never had such a cheap screen. They want more than 500 dollars to replace it.
B06Y14T5YW,saggal,4,"I do love the design of this phone nice and sleek easy to handle. Quick and has tons of memory witch is wonderful plus I added an extra storage on top of that. The camera is the best yet so clear and captures the true light and colors, my family are iPhone lovers however this one had made a few of them switch up. One of the fastest running phones I've owned yet absolutely in love with this"
B06Y14T5YW,Masas family,5,Galaxy is the best!
B06Y14T5YW,Cantrell,5,"Ok, so they ""say"" it's refurbished, but I truly think this one I bought for my hubby was brand new (still on Japan time) from Samsung & nothing in the box was generic, it was all Samsung.! Great purchase, & it came the Same Day I bought it.!!!"
B06Y14T5YW,Sumant T.,5,"Everything works out for this phone.
But if you are looking for carrier features like HD voice quality, video calling and wifi calling, this is not a device for you. NO UNLOCKED phone will support these features. So its a trade off between the carrier bloat ware and the carrier call features.

But all in all this is one rock solid phone."
B06Y14T5YW,D,3,"Earlier this year someone made fun of my old S3. I guess that was sticking around in my head because inexplicably I bought an S8 during the prime day sale. After having the phone for a while I'm ready to say a few things about it.

Are any of the flagship phones worth the price?

No.

No phone is worth this price. For the cost of the S8 I could have replaced my aging laptop.

Is this a nice phone? Sure. The screen seems to gather fingerprints more than my old S3, but aside from that I don't have any complaints off the top of my head. The major problem I've already stated. The value of a flag ship phone is far below the retail price.

Don't be like me. If you're not actually in high school you're fast running out of excuses for succumbing to peer pressure. None of us need $500-700 phones and there's plenty of other crap to be spending our money on."
B06Y14T5YW,changen pan,5,"Great battery life. Getting through a full day of work under heavy use with 30% battery left. With my battery case on, it getting 2 day battery!"
B06Y14T5YW,greg ovink,5,"Love the camera, love the phone, love the memory card slot, love the speed. If I could put a battery in it worth while I would give it 6 stars."
B06Y14T5YW,Ariel Gummer,1,"I liked the last version of this phone better. The S8 is glitchy. Bixby is annoying. The autocorrect seems dumber than The old AI. The curved edges mess with the touch screen. The camera is a little better, but it doesn't make up for the overall poor performance. Not impressed at all."
B06Y14T5YW,Lee,5,"Works perfectly. Just plop in your carrier SIM card and works great, and you don't get all of those forced app downloads that take up your memory."
B06Y14T5YW,Fabio,1,"sadly, this is one of the worst smartphones i ever owned. I am especially disappointed with the camera which is atrocious. All pictures and video are so noisy and low quality is ridiculous. For a phone this price it's unacceptable. I owned a Galaxy S5 previously, and its camera is so superior to the one on this phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Jessica,2,"I checked online to see if this phone was compatible, verizon website confirmed it was but I needed a new SIM for it as mine was an older model. When I got there all they would say was that this phone was incompatible with their network and there was nothing I could do. Ordered the SIM through their website so I'll update if it actually works, but so far it's been a no go for Verizon."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,2,I would not buy another one my husband and I both bought one and the screens cracked even with the screen protectors.within the month.
B06Y14T5YW,J. Ruiz,4,If I could disable bixby button I would give this phone 5 starts.
B06Y14T5YW,S. Lamon,3,"I've had this phone for a day. It was an emergency replacement for my S7. I wasn't too excited about upgrading to the 8 for 1 reason... the lack of a physical home button. I thought that like everything else in the touch screen world, the new home area would be unresponsive at times and I've been right. Several times today, I've had to tap the home area 2 or 3 times before the phone realizes I want it to wake up.
The other issue is the location of the fingerprint reader. Now on the back of the phone, it's tough to get your finger lined up properly without flipping the phone over to look at what you're doing, The facial recognition seems to be pretty good though.

The performance seems great. It's very responsive. Some of the new shortcuts seem helpful. I'm sure I'll get used to it over the coming weeks, but out of the box, I think Samsung should have left some things alone."
B06Y14T5YW,Michael L,5,Exactly as described. Using it for quite a while. No problem at all. Good phone at a good price. Very happy
B06Y14T5YW,Elric Rafa,5,"Excellent product.
I come from Xperia smartphones, this is my first galaxy and truly it's the best, It's worth.
Package arrived in time and with all the stuffs (quick charger, usb cable, earphones (not the best).
Highly recommended, with quick charge you can charge it at 100 percent in aprox 1 hour."
B06Y14T5YW,MD-87,4,"Performance is great. The display and the camera need special mention here. So, does Bixby button - it is a ergonomic nightmare and absolutely useless."
B06Y14T5YW,Jaclyn,5,"Had the phone for a year now, no issues. Was able to choose Verizon on Straight Talk."
B06Y14T5YW,Josiah Molyneux,4,Overall this is a really good phone. I actually like the fingerprint scanner location. The bixby button is extremely annoying and its the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
B06Y14T5YW,AndrÃ©s Weller,5,Amazing. I never get the wireless charger but the phone and the oculus are great. The best phone is no doubt.
B06Y14T5YW,J. Carr,2,"I'm not sure if I can get used to this phone coming from a Nexus 6. Since it's a 5.8"" screen and Nexus 6 is 5.9"", I didn't expect there to be a huge difference. But there is. It's so super narrow it's about the same width as a normal ratio 5"" phone. It appears much smaller in person than I expected when I ordered it.

That I may be able to adapt to. It's the curved edges that are horrible. Not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then I can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. At an angle it's unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. It's especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.

This alone is a deal breaker for me. It's hard to look at. If it was a flat, even surface it would be so much better. I don't predict this gimmick catching on. At least I hope it doesn't."
B06Y14T5YW,Shane,3,"After great experiences with my s4 & Note 4 i couldn't pass up the Prime day deal on the S8. The camera is crazy and the phone itself is solid as a brick (and looks good just sitting there). Nougat and Bixby take some getting used to (I haven't given up and resorted to a custom launcher yet). You can't customize LED colors for different apps/callers. There's still one tiny speaker instead of adopting stereo speakers like other companies. But my biggest complaint is the Bluetooth is Fubar. The forums are full of people that can't get this series phone to sync with radios or speakers. I've tried three cars and two speakers and the only thing it successfully pairs with is the controller for the VR headset. Thankfully my Note4 works just fine for mobile entertainment, but I can't use my car's hands-free calling features.

It's a fine phone, Still has a headphone jack...which apparently I'll need for music since the Bluetooth doesn't work right, but is missing stuff that should have been caught before shipping."
B06Y14T5YW,Kim Warner,3,I'm going to get rid of my S8 Plus because of Bixby. I'm tired of it taking over my phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Tunia,2,Had it in my pants pocket and screen scratched after two days. Never put it into anywhere else that would be endanger it. There was nothing in the pocket too!!! My friend dropped it from the couch to carpet and it shattered as well. Too bad because the software and camera are great. Cannot recommend this phone.
B06Y14T5YW,Sai,5,One of the best phones. I have been with Iphone for more than 5 years and never tried an android phone. Thanks to the campaign as i have opted to try it for the first time and i am loving it. The biggest positive for the phone is its display. Even Camera is very good. I feel they went totally wrong with the fingerprint sensor placement. Design of the phone is great.
B06Y14T5YW,jackson h.,5,"Amazing phone easily connected to T-Mobile, with a little muscle memory the fingerprint reader gets easier to access, the adapters at amazing though, even supporting a mouse yeah a mouse:). Bixby is cumbersome but she can be helpful, especially for reminders."
B06Y14T5YW,betty d.,5,This is am an awesome phone. Look at all the features it as and the 64GB never have to worry about storage.It like everything you want to pack into this device. I love the features and the phone itself. Samsung did a great job creating a phone like this.
B06Y14T5YW,Eric Zielinski,1,I had this phone for about a year and one month and was the best phone I ever had. The camera is point and shoot and the screen is amazing. But recently the phone kept restarting and shutting down. I sent it in to Samsung and since it is 1 month out of warranty I will have to pay a 70 dollar fee. Not a big deal untill they received my device and they now say it is going to be 630 dollars to repair. This is unacceptable and I will never buy another Samsung again!
B06Y14T5YW,victoria oliver,5,Great phone.
B06Y14T5YW,1111,1,Reallllly retarded
B06Y14T5YW,ohGr,1,"Cons first, there are just so many... apple-esque type c connector. Apple-excuse impossible sd card slot. Apple-esque non removable battery. Touchy as hell touch sensitivity. Like mind numbingly horrid. Try turning off your adaptive display and see how garbage it looks next to an LG. I. Hate. This. P.o.s.

Additional cons (as I use the phone, I will update the cons area, I highly doubt the pros field will get updated, samsung really has to show me something special here)
""Can't back up data"" Because OF COURSE samsung sells a 64 gig phone with FULL intention of NOT providing that much much cloud storage and then AUTOMATICALLY SETS UP CLOUD STORAGE because we don't care about the customer, you will still buy our garbage is why.

Pro: the ONLY reason I own this trash is because it's the absolutely only phone with 64 gigs on my network.

However, I love my provider soooo much I am not willing to leave them. BOOST needs more LG's!!!

There's tons more negatives dealing with wireless charging, bluetooth fails, trash wifi... but at least I have storage (whoever's bright idea it was to remove the move app to sd function, you need to just quit, you suck so much) for my two games, yes, only flippin 2. Maybe I'll just quit android all together next time. And after my S2 and s4 experiences I really don't know what the heck I was thinking. Just do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS."
B06Y14T5YW,The zero tolerance spam Tommy,1,"Still on Android 7.0 (Sep 01 2017). Completely outdated firmware, a lot of bloatware on device. Very unfortunate upgrade policy. Great hardware, but software / firmware sucks. Never again Samsung, just very much behind."
B06Y14T5YW,Azura,2,"If you like to be surprised several times every day by your phone doing something different, this is the phone for you!!!

I do like the hardware.

TERRIBLE software! There are layers and layers and needless, annoying complexity that I don't want or need. The worst thing about this phone is it is UNPREDICTABLE. Today I COULD NOT answer an incoming call even though the phone was in my hand! I had been browsing the Internet on Chrome and could HEAR the ring but NO INTERFACE to answer. A day or two ago I got no interface to shut off the LOOKOUT scream feature. Sometimes I get the proper interface, other times not! Full of surprises!

Bixby is useless and annoying as well, and so is the ""battery charging"" screen. Getting into the phone is a hassle most of the time. Sometimes you have to do your pattern, then swipe past a screen or two then do you pattern AGAIN. Why? Who knows. Next time it might be different!

Samsung should stick to HARDWARE and let GOOGLE do the software. Give people ANDROID STOCK phones and stop trying to compete with your own partner. Please! PLEASE!!! If Samsung didn't waste money paying designers and developers to add GARBAGE that degrades they phone, it would probably be better AND cheaper.

I think letting you answer calls is JOB ONE for a PHONE.

Mine fails that most basic task...sometimes...because it is clogged with a bunch of kludgy garbage software. Very disappointed."
B06Y14T5YW,Chea Sunly,5,Nice phone
B06Y14T5YW,MikeNificent,5,"Great phone, feels great in the hand, Bluetooth 5.0, and finger print sensor works great! Takes about 4 hours to get use to it being on the back"
B06Y14T5YW,Princess of Faith,3,It's not that great of a phone. It doesn't come in white. It's curved on the edges so finding a screen protector that doesn't collect lint on the edges under the protector. I can't wait to trade it in later it sucks.
B06Y14T5YW,anyc,3,..same sh__ty battery
B06Y14T5YW,Tim in Portland,1,"The screen cracks easily and you will be out $700+ dollars (not covered in manufacturer's warranty). You don't need to drop the phone to crack the screen.

This is a warning, Google ""Samsung Galaxy S8"" and screen and see what you come up with.

If Samsung doesn't issue a recall, there may soon be a class action lawsuit."
B06Y14T5YW,Sunnybuns 2001,2,I didn't buy my phone from Amazon but I wanted to give my two cents. I've only had it a few hours but beware all of you who are used to a 12 hour digital time readout. This phone only offers analog and military time.I checked the internet and found others that wanted to change that and found they couId not change it. I'm a military brat and still never liked to use military time. Not a fan of Bixby either.
B06Y14T5YW,Monica,5,"I love this phone, when I say Love. I love this phone! Its awesome, it came with everything included in the box and was easy to set up with the phone company of my choice."
B06Y14T5YW,Leen,5,good phone
B06Y14T5YW,Charles S.,5,good good good
B06Y14T5YW,Jose M.,5,"Amazing! This phone looks beautiful. Software wise, it's okay, get a different launcher if you want."
B06Y14T5YW,Aasheesh Goud,4,"Great phone with a stunning edge to edge display that allows users to immerse themselves in video and gaming content. Although being an iOS user it was difficult to have apps from android not match the extent of options I am used to. The only other issue is if you have hands that can not reach the finger print sensor. But, all in all a great phone if you are able to move to the android ecosystem. Probably the best android phones out there!"
B06Y14T5YW,Mrs. DoubtFire,1,previously used or refurbished. this is not a brand new phone
B06Y14T5YW,Masons mom,1,"Not a good choice. Should have paid the money from Verizon. Emails, calls, messages take days to get and I live in the city. No notification for voicemail built in. Would not buy again."
B06Y14T5YW,Lisa Carter,5,Still loving it!
B06Y14T5YW,zero,5,"The king is here. Prepare your ass- be whooped, Apple!"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"Look out for the guarantee when it is an international version because if something goes wrong you have to track down the manufacturer in whatever country it could be to see if he takes the repair. In my case I bought an international version in the US and Amazon would not take responsibility for the malfunction, nor the seller because it appeared a few weeks after the purchase, and nor Samsung USA because it was not manufactured in the USA. I has to track down myself the manufacturer who happened to be in East Asia. I had to shipped them my phone with no guarantee which I finally decidad not to do. I an stuck with a phone that does everything OK except the talking function in a phone call.
Kind regards"

B06Y14T5YW,Beautyc,1,"Battery sucks, you have to turn on the battery saver to survive a day. 'OK google' not working in this phone. Bixby is worst"
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,Lots of great new features. Slimmer.
B06Y14T5YW,Unknown,5,Nice Improvement over S7
B06Y14T5YW,Moe,5,"Nothing short of the best flagship phone I have ever bought for the price ($500 to be exact). With a combination of the high build quality, beautiful screen design, long battery life (even longer than the S7 Edge), crystal-clear camera, IP68 waterproof rating, and blazing performance, it leaves nothing to be desired. Ordering from Prime Now, I received it in 1.5 hours with no issues."
B06Y14T5YW,Ash Paul,5,AMAZING phone. Looks so good and functionality is seamless
B06Y14T5YW,Ellcina A.,5,I love my new phone. My first upgrade in years.
B06Y14T5YW,Shravankumar,5,"Best phone for current era. It would have been more good, if it supports dual sim option like international version."
B06Y14T5YW,kenneth e.sticken,5,"love the phone,deviled fast just love it"
B06Y14T5YW,cecdfdgg,2,"cannot stand this phone. round edges are sleek but not user friendly; hard to tap on apps when the tap is on the curve of the phone. Connectivity seems to be not as good as what i had with S6 which seems to be a Verizon problem in general these days. Also, the slide answer button on the phone for incoming calls sometimes fails to slide and connect???? Look elsewhere, this is not your latest greatest of smart phones."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"Bought at Sam's Club. 17 days after owning the phone it would no longer charge at the port. There was defect in the connection. I contacted the company. They had me send in the phone for repair. Eleven days later (yesterday) I got my phone back. Charging port worked fine, but then the phone kept shutting down and restarting. I couldn't even get it to stay on long enough to set it up. I contacted the company again and I have sent off the phone again for repairs. Where the phone is barely used I wish they would just replace it so that I could have an experience without a defective phone. I spent a lot of money on this phone. The phone is beautiful in design, but I was not going for beauty, just reliability, and it failed, miserably. Because of this experience with the phone and customer service, this is, most likely, my last Samsung phone purchase. If you buy this phone, you'll need the warranty. Unfortunately, I didn't buy the warranty. I had already paid more than intended for the phone. I didn't have the funds for the warranty."
B06Y14T5YW,Angel,5,I love it <3

B06Y14T5YW,Rania Radjabaly,1,"we ordered a Samsung Galaxy S8+, and it was to take it as a gift in Madagascar. The person opened it and realized that its a Samsung S8 and not a + while we paid full price for it."
B06Y14T5YW,Rick B.,2,"Disappointing. I was looking forward to upgrading from Note 4 to 8. Once I saw/held the 8, I decided to stick with the 4. The 8 is too long and skinny making it inconvenient to read on, it breaks to easily and is slips out of the hand easier. By now, all phones should be stronger/more impact resistant for dropping without a case. Hopefully the Note 9 will be better meaning shorter, wider and stronger."
B06Y14T5YW,Frank M. Schwieterman,2,"I repeatedly get notifications to sign-in with my samsung account. I don't want to use a samsung account, I just want to use my phone. It happens at all hours of the day, and they set it up so it can't be disabled like other notifications. If you want a phone that will wake you up all the time, this is the phone for you."

B06Y14T5YW,Mohit,5,"This is possibly the best phone I have ver owned. The display is brilliant, camera is superb and at sub 580$ this is a steal of a deal for this devise. Definitely a must buy."
B06Y14T5YW,Elena,1,"I am disappointed with this purchase. AT&T is my service provider and I have limited cell phone service at home. Someone suggested turning on WiFi calling to improve cell service. I did not find the WiFi calling option on this unlocked cell phone. I went into AT&T store and was advised that since I did not purchase the phone from AT&T, some features such as WiFi calling would not be available. Very disappointed that unlock phone does not have same features AT&T/carrier purchased phone."
B06Y14T5YW,Caliguy86,5,I bought my samsung s8+ and had it unlocked. Oh my!! This was the best phone I have ever purchased!! Everything runs smooth and it has a decent battery life. All in all Samsung you did a great job and this phone is def worth the investment.

B06Y14T5YW,140dot6,2,"samsung software is awful and intrusive
bixby sucks
fingerprint scanner sucks
headphones suck

save yourself the trouble and get an LG"
B06Y14T5YW,ron,2,"1rst and biggest, you have to get a case. This phone is so slippery it's silly. I set it on a pillow the other morning it would not stay. gravity slowly Slid it off. I've dropped this 600$ phone twice in less than a week. It has rounded/tappered edges hardly any bezel to get a purchase on. Yes this is normally a good thing, but dropping sucks.
2nd finger print sensor is in a poorly thought out spot next to camera lens. It's hard to say where to place it because it feels natural where they put it. Maybe move camera, Regardless your camera lens Will be smudged.
3rd bixby not interested in it and I don't have a choice. The dedicated button is in the worst spot. If I hold phone in landscape to take pic, watch video, or what ever I hit the button (by the way I'm left handed) with thumb. Phone is so slick holding in landscape position is precarious already. Samsung and bloatware, bixby is to much and to dedicate an annoying button to it is absolutely dumb.
4th the screen is curved on edges and can be touched or tapped. I have big hands, phone is slick, phone is thin, and edges are round so i try to grip it good especially in landscape. Watching a YouTube video as an example either I hit bixby button or accidently hit top left corner of screen dropping notifications bar down or in YouTube back video up 10 seconds(how i am double tapping is beyond me). I have ordered a case it's been a week waiting on shipping I hope this fixes most of these problems. Being one of the more expensive phones out there, You would think these things would be thought through.
5th I liked having removable battery option but LG doesn't offer any more. So I am assuming no decent smart phone has that option anymore. But on average I get a new phone every 2-3 years and generally battery would be replaced once in that time. 600$-700$ it should last that long.
Seems to be a rant but for the money it should be better. And for god sakes stop with the bloatware, and a dedicated physical button. Seems like your are trying to piss off customers."
B06Y14T5YW,Michael Chatman,5,Samsung Galaxy 8 is the best phone on the market. I love it!
B06Y14T5YW,jose zapata,5,Very good
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,Would probably be a good phone if not for the super annoying Bixby app that you cannot turn off.

B06Y14T5YW,Melanie M. Meeson,1,Can I leave a negative review? Gorilla glass doesn't protect from shattering your screen. It's marketing B.S.. my phone is shattered!!!!
B06Y14T5YW,J. Walker,1,Assigned this as a work phone. I am already seeking to buy my own phone and move the sim as I type this. Who thought beveled edges were a good idea?
B06Y14T5YW,F pickels,1,"Just hope you never have a problem. Fragile, and absolutely horrible customer support. And I mean horrible..... Samsung refuses to honor warranty claim. Keep sending this piece of junk S8 back to me. Actually 3 times. They keep apologizing. And issuing a new RMA And then after a week return to me..... What a joke. Do not waste your time or money on this phone or this company. I will never by a Samsung product again. Not recommended ever....."
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,5,It's amazing this phone
B06Y14T5YW,Amazon Customer,1,"This phone was a major disappointment. Screen breaks way too easily. Cases don't cover the rounded edge which leaves the screen exposed. Screen sctaches easily. Also much slower that my iPhone 6 I'm terms of loading the camera, loading apps, making calls, sending texts. This phone would be gone if I hadn't already sold my iPhone 6..."
B06Y14T5YW,Peter M,1,I hate Bixby. Samsung please disable Bixby. The phone is a piece of glass. Buy the case before you buy the phone. Otherwise it's a great phone.
B06Y14T5YW,KevT,1,"Great looking phone but not a good daily driver. Very slippery and edge to edge screen too prone to accident touching. I keep tapping on the phone icon by accident while holding the phone. Bezels being too thin here really is problematic. Apple has much better accident touch detection.

A case can help with the issue but can't fix the really weak battery life. Typical daily use, I am down to 54% by noon time. Requires charging, luckily there is fast charging. They should include a bigger battery not smaller.

The new touch screen home button is very confusing and awkward to use. I have used Pixel, Nexus 6P, this new home button mimicks a physical one but performs very slowly in responsiveness. You really have ""find"" the home button. It doesn't just press anywhere on the bottom to activate it.

The screen also seems to lag behind S7 Edge in responsiveness.

This is not a good phone for Pokemon Go at all. The battery life sucks and the phone isn't much faster than S7 Edge.

Plus side camera and screen quality is great but not a huge leap over the S7 Edge."
B06Y14T5YW,Chris Dodge,1,Cheap phone that breaks easily.
B06Y14T5YW,Kate Johnson,2,Absolutely gorgeous phone and display. Gorilla glass screen being indestructible is a joke. It's the most fragile smartphone I've ever owned. Extremelt disappointed with all aspects of Samsung customer servive.
B06Y14T5YW,Stephen,2,"My faith in Samsung is going down the drain. We've used Samsung forever. But when my hubby's s8 plus screen cracks when it falls in the couch, and my s8 plus screen cracked because the tip of my hairspray bottle barely landed on it, you gotta wonder. Why such fragile phones. And no warranty to cover such incidents. Not like we dropped them on the ground."
B06Y14T5YW,Kendra Palmer,1,Phone keeps losing internet connection requiring me to go to T-Mobile to reset it
B06Y14T5YW,rocknhard,2,"This phone is ok. The infinity display is ridiculous. No case will protect it from drops. Had and S5 for years until it was stolen. No problems with mild drops. Put an Otter box on this S8 plus and have had it for a month, broken screen. Extremely short drop and if the retarded screen wasn't sticking out, nothing would be broke. Brilliant idea Samsung. What is the point of this? Anyone know? Maybe to sell more screens?"
B06Y14T5YW,A. Sam,1,"My first new phone had pink line within first 30 days, then they replaced my phone and

battery dies within half day and again they replaced my phone and

Now it does not turn on/off on very first day.

WASTE OF MONEY & NOT A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT."
B06Y14T5YW,Greg,1,"Do not purchase this phone. This phone calls people in my contact list all day. This phone opens applications all day. Can't turn off Bixby which is calling and opening apps indiscriminately and Samsung says that there is no way to disable or turn off the very sensitive Bixby button. There is no Bixby application button to open Bixby if you could turn off very sensitive Bixby button. Butt dialing or pocket dialing is the issue, sensitive home button that opens the phone when it's locked, sensitive Bixby button that opens the phone when locked, camera on the lock screen opens the camera and starts taking pictures. When holding the phone applications near the edge of the screen and your hand open."
B06Y14T5YW,What_Says_Nott,2,If you like putting your super slim technological wonder into some mammoth case then you'll be fine. Otherwise buy insurance or prepare to replace a lot of screens.
B06Y14T5YW,Eric Y.,1,"Everything that Samsung makes is crap.
To make it worse, they have the worst customer service and a warranty process that is intentionally designed to make 75% of legitimate claimants give up. Thatâs a fact, look it up. 3 of 4 people that bought a crappy Samsung product and try to get Samsung to stand behind their product, give up because the process is more of a headache than itâs worth.
Buy your goods from companies that stand behind their products and actually WANT to make quality products and stay true to their word."

B06Y14T5YW,Kevin R.,2,Screen is very easy to break. No case can protect the curved screen. Do not buy.
B06Y14T5YW,gmc,1,Got this phone for free from employer. Samsung Camera stops working. Ruined my vacation. Samsung keyboard stops working. Can't download apps. Phone Screen gets ON unnecessarily. Phone reset is not a solution at all. Samsung should stop making phone OS.

After the first 3 months the phone becomes extremely sluggish when moving between apps and different home screens, while I am use to this slowdown on mobile devices, this is the only time it started slowing down before I had owned it for a single quarter.

B078NCL7GK,sct,3,"UPDATE (7/28/18)
The earlier performance issues I had have disappeared with Huawei's update to Android 8 - it is a snappy phone. So, from a screen, form factor, UI, and app performance (for the price) - it's a 5-star phone.

BUT.... What no ""professional"" review will ever do is tell you about the performance of the actual 4G radio itself - because that involves science. My experience is that when I transitioned from my Huawei Nexus 6P to the Honor 7X calling from my home tanked. I can hear the caller fine but they can't hear me. Because the Honor 7X is not a phone sold by the carriers, they don't support VoIP through the native dialer - so, many times, I have to resort to going outside to take the call or use WhatApp. For this reason, I'm demoting my vote 2-stars. So, if you're in semi-marginal coverage - be aware. (I also am starting to experience a lot of ""GPS Signal Not Found"" - which is highly annoying when I'm in mid-trip and depending on the directions).

UPDATE (2/18/18):
After having the phone 1 month, the one nit I have is with Android Auto on my Volt. Sometimes the 7x has problems keeping up (i.e. map screen is blank). The remedy is to reboot. But, I've had a love-hate relationship with Android Auto on my Nexus 6p too - not this particular problem but enough other things that makes me wonder how much real testing is done on the app. So, it's hard to say if it's the 7x or Google.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Unfortunately, my previous phone, the Nexus 6P (which was also Huawei-built) entered into the boot-loop of death this last weekend and I needed to get a new phone. Settling on a new phone is a life-decision for me because it's with me more than anything else that I own. I was looking for a short-term phone before the upcoming Galaxy 9 announcement and decided on the Honor 7x because of the reviews - the 7x was oxymoronically termed the ""premium budget"" phone. Once I bought a new flagship, I'd let the Honor 7x become a backup phone.

Wow - I was not expecting this phone.

What's great
* Built Quality - it feels like a flagship
* Snappy performance - enough said
* Headphone jack - I'm a big user of bluetooth, but many times I don't want the hassle
* Included case - another $20 that I don't need to spend
* MicroSD slot - I like the option of more memory without having to pay extortion pricing for embedded memory
* Low phone stress: At this price, I don't need to guard this phone like a Faberge egg (yes, I had to look up the spelling for that)

What's not great and why it doesn't matter to me (i.e. would I pay an additional $400+ to get these features)
* No Type-C: Yes, I'm trying to standardize on this but I've got plenty of microUSB devices now. I'm living in a mixed charger world for a while so I'm okay with it (but only this time)
* Not OLED: Yes, my Nexus 6P was brighter. But, fixing a cracked OLED cost more than this phone (so I lived with a cracked screen)
* Camera: I'm sure the camera isn't as good as the flagships but it doesn't move my $400 needle
* Bezel - it has a small bezel. Who cares.
* No fast charging: You need fast charging when your battery can't get you through the day - this battery will more than get you through the day
* No 5GHz WiFi radio: It's loading apps and streaming videos plenty fast for me now.
* No NFC: Since I can't depend on vendors accepting Android Pay, I've always got my credit cards with me.
* Not waterproof: I'll just continue to be careful with the phone.
* Not SnapDragon latest: As long as the performance is good - it doesn't matter.
* I can't remember how to spell Hawui: But, I feel superior to others in that I can pronounce it.

What's not great and may not matter to you:
* Comes with Android 7, not Andriod 8. Given that only .2% of devices were on 8 you probably don't care about this. For me, it's inexcusable for a manufacturer to release a phone on an old OS. This is why when I transitioned from Apple to Android, I settled on the Google Nexus because I knew I would always get the latest. As a tech enthusiast, when I read about a new software feature that's available, I need to have it. But, the reality is that, unlike the old days when new major versions of OS's contained exciting and life-altering features, the last set of major releases have been kind of a yawn-fest. But, it's still important to me and how Huewai keeps pace with the latest releases will be a factor if I choose them again.

Summing it up, great phone at a fantastic price. I would pay more if I needed to, but with the Honor 7x, it don't. IMHO, if you are buying a flagship phone from Samsung/Apple/Google, you're making a fashion statement.

(but, I'll let you know if I change my opinion)"
B078NCL7GK,Sarah,5,"I bought this phone after finally having to give up on my iPhone 6's battery life. That thing barely lasted half a day and if I used something heavy like maps, it would be instant death. I wasn't sure what to expect from this phone, but I couldn't afford a pricey iPhone X or Google Pixel. I have been so far pleasantly surprised. I'd say this phone works better and faster than my old iPhone ever did. I can now open apps and type words into search bars without it having to think about it and my battery lasts all day long. It's also extremely touch sensitive, something I had to get used to after my less touch sensitive iPhone. I can't say good enough things about this phone. The only downside is the screen will be less crisp than a more expensive one and the camera isn't top of the line crystal clear. I've added a photo to give you an idea. Still this phone is great and definitely is an exception to you get what you pay for. More phones should be this reasonably priced. I will recommend to everyone who wants a new phone that feels like an expensive top of the line one but can't afford it. Also I had cricket and switching over was as easy as taking my SIM card out of my iPhone and putting it in this one."
B078NCL7GK,Mr. Tim,3,"As far as size, looks, screen resolution and touch response, the phone seems excellent.

However, the only reason I bough this phone was for the dual-SIM capability. What Huawei and almost every other phone provider doesn't tell you (and it takes a LOT of digging to find out) is that the first SIM operates as you would expect (LTE/4G/3G), but the second SIM operates ONLY on 2G.

No big deal, right? WRONG. 2G is being phased out in the US. In fact, the cellular communicator for my home alarm system was 2G and ceased working 2 YEARS ago. There is no 2G in my area. Maybe there's 2G in your area (very few areas), but that won't help you when you travel nor will it help you when 2G finally ceases to stop working in your area (and it will).

You can switch which SIM is the active SIM through the phone configuration, but you will only receive (or make) calls on the active SIM.

If you need a phone with dual-SIM and 3G on the second SIM, the Samsung J7 and one of the Sony's will do it. Make sure you get the specific model, as there are multiple J7's."
B078NCL7GK,Amber Morales,4,"If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I like phones and test drive MANY in search of really good phones, were kind of s phone family. Having said that, I am a Huawei fan since the Mate 2. They just build good phones for an incredible price. We have owned all the high end Mates and everything since the Honor 5 to this phone, the 7x. I say that to say, I don't mind paying more for a good phone...but the Honor line has made it so I don't have to pay more for a quality phone with really good specs. I never would have imagined a $200 phone could be this good.

The photos are a side by side comparison to the Honor 5, for size comparison.

The first thing I noticed about this phone is how remarkably thin it is for an almost 6 inch screen, with three cameras (two on back, one forward facing) It's much lighter and thinner than the 5, yet feels more solid in the hand. This phone has a nice large battery and I'm sure it will last my husband all day, with moderate text and web use. It uses a micro USB charger, which is fine for most people who still have a ton of micro USB chargers around (I personally prefer type C, but my husband hates change and likes the micro USB). Even though the screen is almost 6 inches, it doesn't feel too large..and definitely feels smaller than my Mate 9. The screen is bright and the resolution looks great. ALL my husband's apps and data transferred over (all 64 apps) within 16 minutes with the phone clone app that Huawei uses for data and app transfer. The phone is super fast and switched between apps quickly with no freezing or lag (yet). The UI is typical Huawei, but you can download the google launcher or other launcher of your choice to give a more familiar feel. We use cricket (which is AT&T prepaid) and had no issues with the APN, it configured automatically. Placed a call and the sound was good and definitely loud enough on speaker.
The camera is good...it's not the Mate 9 Leica but it's good and I didn't feel the need to mess with any settings. Is plenty good for social media pics, selfies and pics of the kids, pets, life's most embarrassing moments, etc. It still has a headphone jack, which I prefer to an adapter or even wireless. The finger print sensor is lightning fast and works before you even realize you have pressed your finger against the sensor. Not too much bloatware, certainly not as much as carrier locked phones! It has 64 GB of space, AND room for a memory card. Comes with Android 8 which is pretty similar to 7, but nice to have updated out of the box. It encrypts the SD card so be aware if you choose this option that you won't be able to just pop your SD card out of this phone and into another without changing the settings.
Time will tell, but based on prior experience with Huawei, as well an Apple, Samsung and various bargain phones, I believe this is another keeper! It's a shame AT&T backed out of the deal to bring this phone to the carrier, but it may work to the consumers advantage by keeping prices competitive.
DAY THREE of heavy use and no glitches, lagging, freezing or resets.
Love this phone more worth each passing day.
Months later and I still believe this is the best sub $200 phone out."
B078NCL7GK,Tom B. Whitehouse,5,"I waited to do this review until after using with the EMUI 8.0/Oreo 8.0 Android update, as the previous Nougat software had some lag issues. On my phone, these appear to be fixed now.

The phone is smooth and fast for everything I do everyday (I am not a gamer). I have not missed the extra gig of ram I would have gotten with the Huawei Mate SE or the international version of the Honor 7x. The fingerprint sensor is blazing fast and accurate. The new face unlock, not so much. It works about 70% of the time. But for me it's not an issue. The fingerprint sensor not only unlocks the phone but can be set for other things as well, like taking a pic or scrolling in some apps.

It feels like a much more expensive phone. Solid in the hand, very much like IPhone 7. The screen is bright and clear, with fairly good viewing angles, usable but not great in bright sunlight. The speaker is loud enough but a little tinny, but hey, it's got a headphone jack, and good sound though it at that! Calls are loud and clear, GPS works great.

I like EMUI 8. It's fast and pretty customizable, with lots of themes available on the Google store. But if you prefer something else, this is Android, so there are many other launchers available. I do wish they had kept stock Android's ability to move apps to the SD card, however. As it is, data can live there, but apps cannot. Still, I've got pretty much all the apps I'll probably use, and still about 12 gigs of space.

The cameras are great for pictures in good lighting, with lots of options and a good manual pro mode. In low lighting things fall off significantly. And video takes clear shots and great sound, but no optical or digital stabilization, and only 1080p, no 4k.

Downside? No NFC (so no Android Pay), A Micro USB port instead of USB-C. Charging not as fast as some others. No official waterproofing (though there are some YouTube vides that show it to be pretty resistant to an accidental dunk. Not going to test it myself). Still it is amazing how much phone you can get for under $200. I would recommend it to anyone who does not need ultimate gaming performance, Android Pay, or absolute top-level camera. Or, If the camera is the issue, Buy this, and use the money you save to buy a real camera."
B078NCL7GK,Chris McK,5,"Update 04-08-2018: I've had the phone for over a month now and it's still great. Every few days I have to reboot it because it does seem to slow down...but rebooting a phone every 5 days it's a problem to me at all. It does charge slowly, but again, not an issue for me. Plugging it in at 10% easily gets to 100% overnight. The battery life is still amazing. I use it heavily throughout the day and it's still at 50% or more by the time I go to bed. Typically I charge it every two days or maybe top it off a little bit if needed.

I had an Axon 7 (which I absolutely loved) but the battery would only last a few hours so decided it was time for a new phone. I couldn't find anything with the nice specs of my Axon 7 so decided to settle for this phone until something better came along. I was totally shocked how good this phone is. It totally buries my Axon 7 on boot up and is very responsive. I didn't particularly care for the UI so replaced it with Nova launcher. I was a bit worried whether it would work correctly because other reviewers said they had problems getting it to work. I had no issues at all. I use T-Mobile and MMS wouldn't work at all the first day, but by the next day it was working...not sure what's up with that (I'm using Textra).

The phone does lack a few things that would be nice, but they are absolutely not deal breakers. USB-C would have been nice, but I have a ton of the old cables, so that's not a problem. An IR blaster would be nice, but to be honest I haven't really used those on my old phones and they had them.

My biggest gripe at this point might be the sound. It's ok, but nothing special at all. Perhaps it's because I was spoiled by the Axon 7, but I'd rather have a phone with a mediocre speaker than one I had to charge 3 times a day.

The battery life is amazing. I started off the day with 67% charged. I listened to an audio book to and from work (40 minute commute each way), had waze on for 40 minutes, made a few phone calls and listened to music all day...about 8 hours (screen off). By the time I got home the charge was down to 45%!! This beats the heck out of any other phone I had and used this much. The phone looks and feels great...it doesn't feel like I only spent $199 on it.

The great part is watching others go spend $1000 on a new iPhone and realize that my 7x is just as functional and I could have 5 of them."
B078NCL7GK,Red Fox,5,"For $200 this phone is a absolutely a bargain. Pros: battery last long, screen are big resolution are good....
Cons: no 5G WiFi and speaker is a little weak, no Android 8.0 yet. The GPS chip is pretty junky, I don't use the gos often so it not a big deal to me, other than that its a perfect one for the budget I'm really happy that I bought it."
B078NCL7GK,Rafael Quezada,1,"I bought this phone on March 6, 2017, I received 2 updates, currently with Android 8, Emui 8. the only problem is the GPS, it does not work with Google Maps or Waze, it is a pity that a quality team like this present this problem"
B078NCL7GK,Somebody,4,"Here's a review from a total phone newbie without all the fancy, smart lingo that usually comes with phone reviews.

My phone history: I was an apple user. Had four iPhones.

So it's a nice change... It was hard to get use to an Android phone after so many years of using iPhones but here are the pros:

1) Big phone. Great for games, watching things and browsing. You will need two hands.
2) Soooo much storage... more than I am used to. And you can add MORE storage? Sign me up.
3) Definitely durable and comes with a case. I tend to drop my phones. A lot. So it was nice they included a semi-transparent case and there isn't any (big) damages to the phone yet despite a little slip from my hands at least once a day.
4) I fell on the phone. This thing BENDS. It contorted to the shape of my butt. The glass made it out no scratches. I just had to bend the phone back to its flatten shape.
5) You can withdraw your texts a few seconds before it sends.
6) You can do split screens.

Cons:
1) Camera quality is horrible. Selfie camera produces blurry, or at least not very sharp pictures. The back camera isn't that great either. Colors come out looking overly-saturated and doesn't capture a lot of details like I'm used to with the iPhones.
2) You cannot delete system apps like shitty Google Duo app."
B078NCL7GK,apoeli00,1,"This is a beautifully designed and impressively priced phone that I would be more than satisfied with if one crucial aspect was present... It is NOT unlocked. I have spent the past two days trying to locate the source of my problem with my carrier to understand why my phone will not connect to my network. I originally assumed it was an issue with my SIM card, but it turns out my phone is still ""locked"" and will not be supported by another carrier until I contacted the company to resolve the issue. I reached out to them and did not receive any response. It has affected my work and I wasted $200 on a phone I had considerable hopes for."
B078NCL7GK,Chris,4,"OVERALL - Great phone for the price. As of the date of this review, the phone is hard to beat in this price range. The mid-range processor can handle most app's and games without issue. However, there are some issues that'll be addressed below.

SOFTWARE - The software, EMUI 5.1, will definitely leave you polarized. You'll either like it or you won't. It has an iOS look and feel to it. I bought Nova Launcher Prime and use that as the replacement launcher. The Honor 7x is set to receive Android Oreo updates sometime in Q2 2018.

HARDWARE - The Honor 7x has Huawei Kirin 695 processor. It's mid-range spec and is definitely capable of handling the day in and day out's of your average consumer. I've been able to play each game I've downloaded flawlessly. My issue is that the phone gets very hot in the back right corner at the top after an hour or more of intensive use such as playing a game, and I'm assuming the processor throttles itself in response to the heat, which will cause a noticeable performance drop.

There also seems to be random performance drops unrelated to what app's I'm using or how long I've been using the phone. They're rare but when they do occur, they're very noticeable and annoying. Sometimes app icons will disappear and will only reappear when the performance stabilizes. Other times there is a noticeable delay in starting apps after clicking them. I can't really explain how or why it's happening because I've been unable to recreate the issue intentionally other than when playing an intensive game for an hour or more and letting the phone get very hot.

BUILD - The phone is beautiful and feels great in the hand. It's not slippery feeling but is very smooth. It feels very solid. I used to worry with my last phone that if I sat down with it in my back pocket, that I'd bend it. I've no concern of that with this phone.

CAMERA - The camera's are average at best. They're not terrible. They're not great. The front-facing camera will get the job done for selfie's as long as you have good lighting. The dual-camera setup on the back is is also decent. With proper lighting and a steady hand, you can get some decent pictures.

SCREEN - It's not an AMOLED but that's not really an issue for me. The black's aren't as deep or rich of course, but that's an acceptable loss for this price range. The screen does auto-brighten in day light, which makes it a little more easily used outside. My only complaint is that the screen is very, very sensitive to touch. So sensitive in fact that if I'm scrolling through the app drawer and barely touch the edge of an app icon for even a split second, it'll launch. Coming from an iPhone, the sensitivity difference is going to take getting used to."
B078NCL7GK,annabelle,5,"Had this phone for just over a week now and I can honestly say that I have zero complaints. It does exactly what I wanted and then some. I was previously using ""BLU"" phones and after quite a bit of researched decided to switch over. Where as my BLU phone was sluggish and laggy this phone is fast and takes almost no time to load anything I ask of it. I also really really love the double screen feature it has. The camera could be better, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons for this gem."
B078NCL7GK,Vincent,5,"If you want a modernized looking phone that can do the basics like social media, web browsing and e-mails, but less than half the cost of flag ship phones; this is a phone to consider.

-Looking Sexy
Back of the phone looks very similar to an iphone 6/7 with horizontal antenna bands on top/bottom,and thin profile. But also has a fingerprint reader.

Front of the phone has a very nice with bezel-less 18x9 screen ratio

-Screen Quality
No AMOLED display. so you're not going to have the best HD/4K movie viewing experience. But the 1080p LED display is very high quality despite that. Unless you're really accustomed to AMOLD Quad HD displays you won't notice a significant difference especially if you watch lower quality videos like on youtube.

-Speakers/Headphone Jack
Speakers are basic. Have one bottom firing speaker. As long as you're mindful placing your fingers when viewing video horizontally you won't have any issue.

Sound coming out is similar okay. Doesn't have enough bass, but loud enough to listen to vocals of songs and podcasts in a quiet room.

Has a headphone jack which some $800+ flagship phones abandoned for blue tooth only (unless you have an adapter). Very nice inclusion for those who still use wired headsets

-Duel Sim/Micro SD expansion
Self explanatory. Like the headphone jack, missing from most flagship phones nowadays

-Camera
Produces very good photos in the right lighting conditions. Not going to produce the highest quality photos like the Pixel 2, Note 8, or iphone X, but decent enough to share photos on facebook or instagram without being criticized about the quality (unless your friends are really nit picky).

Duel camera makes for a nice Bokeh effect (where the background is blurred, making more focus on the subject). At times it can look a bit artificial though (especially if the subject is far away), but most of the time it does it's job well. You can adjust this post snap shot.

No optical image stabilization when taking pictures, so best not to move around a lot for a second or two after taking the snap shot. You can use the finger print sensor instead of on-screen capture button to take pictures. Have to turn this on from settings.

Video is good if you have a steady hand, and not walking/jogging while filming as it does product a shaking cam effect if you move around a lot

-Finger Print Sensor
Works 100% of the time for me with dry clean hands. Scans instantly, no need to wobble my finger back-and-forth or hold down for a second or two.

You can also use finger print sensor to take a picture, scroll down webpages, or press and hold to pick up a call

-Gaming
Can run most 2D/less graphic intensive games really well. For 3D, high graphic intensive games; frame rate might dip a bit depending on how much is going on screen.

The phone also doesn't have gyro controls, so for games that requires it; it's unplayable depending on how much is implemented

-Operating System
Runs Android 8.0. So up to date as of this review. There are some custom firmware, but it doesn't take away from core Android experience.

It's mixture of iOS and Android leaning a lot towards Android. So good transition if you're thinking of switching over

An awesome feature this phone has is ability to do twin apps. Great if you have dual accounts for one app as don't have to switch users every time.

There is some bloatware apps, but you are able to remove/delete them from your phone, but most are very useful in my opinion. Best to test it out before deleting

Scrolling through apps is very smooth. May get a half second stutter if you view webpages with a lot of things to load.

There's no performance issues even when multi-tasking

-Works With T-Mobile
Have Tmobile as phone service provider. Network data and phone calls come through fine in my area.

-What it comes with
Phone, Wall charger/cable, instructions, and case. The case is very basic and makes the phone scratch resistant (minus the screen) in case you put your phones and keys in the same pocket/bag. I recommend getting a replacement case if you're the clumsy type and drop your phone often

-Missing features compared to Flag Ship Phones
Being 1/4 the cost of most flag ship phones like the latest Samsung, Google and iphone. Some features are bound to be missing. Here's a list of what's not included compared to top of the line smart phones out there:

1. No NFC. Not able to make mobile payments or physical touch data transfers.
2. Not water or dust resistant. Can get around this with phone cases that provide these features
3. No gyro sensor. As mentioned before may restrict some of your gaming
4. No wireless charging
5. Uses Micro USB instead of USB type C
6. No fast charging. Takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge from 10% battery life. Battery can last up to 2.5 days as long if you're not a heavy user. Idle time on this phone is really good. If you binge watch Netflix, it'll last 4-5 hours.

Overall, very good phone that's able to hang with the big boys (flag ship phones) with Android 8.0, modern exterior design and ability to run the usual apps.

Super affordable and excellent phone for the price. Highly recommend to anyone who just need the basics when it comes to Android."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,"Overall this was an amazing phone. Was. Rarely had issues with apps loading, switching etc. Had plenty of storage to hold pictures, music and apps. Fingerprint scanner worked great as long as you kept it clean, and your hands were not wet or too dirty. Dual sim worked perfectly and was little hassle to switch between the two sim cards. Picture quality is fantastic, although it would be nice for more editing options. Sound quality was okay with the speakers, but I rarely had issues using Bluetooth and the headphone jack. Call quality was about standard, nothing out-of-the-park. It was hard to find a decent screen protector for it because of the 2.5D screen, the tempered glass ones never stayed on, but the soft ones worked perfectly. Same thing with a case, there are not a lot of options out there for a case. Battery life was nice, only had to charge it about every other day, with Wi-Fi, mobile data, and location services on. Without those running, it was about 3 or so days between charges.

However, this phone has barely lasted a year before failing. I bought this in February 2018, and just now in December it no longer charges, no longer connects to a computer. There has been tons of dirt and grime buildup in the charging port, as well as the headphone jack, which constantly needed to be cleaned out, which will wear out the contacts inside the charging port over time. A case that covers those would have prevented that, but there are very few options when it comes to phone cases. In addition to no longer charging, the phone will not unlock once the screen times out. Pressing the unlock/power button on the side ends up rebooting the phone and shutting it down instead of unlocking the screen, even with a single press. The fingerprint reader will not work either.

Everything about this phone was nice, except for the lifespan. Save the money and put it towards a phone that will last longer than a year."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I've been using this phone for about a month and I really like it. The battery lasts a good deal of time (around two days with normal activity, or one day if I watch videos or play games often), it has a nice camera and memory capacity, and very convenient settings. I love the fingerprint sensor in the back, it makes super easy for me to unlock my phone. I also really like that it allows me to call my contacts only by saying their name; everything is very accurate.
By far it's been the best, yet the least expensive phone I've ever had."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"If you are the type of person who doesn't care about brands and trendy technology, and you just need a good reliable smartphone with a good camera THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU. I am a college student at UT and this phone is my saving grace. It does everything my friends iphones can do (minus facetime, but my friends and I use google duo). My phone also has more storage, a bigger screen, a longer lasting battery, and was a fraction of the cost of an iphone. I can go a whole day and a half without charging it. For the record, I'm not just being idealistic about the difference between iphone's and this phone. The reason I even had to buy this phone was because my iphone 7 was a piece of ______. I was barely able to use the phone for a week. It was sooooooooo glitchy and the IC chip or whatever was faulty (a problem apparently VERY common to Iphone 7s), so I couldn't even make calls, only text. However, the phone I had right before the iphone 7 was an honor 6, which I gave to my younger brother and after about 2 years of use is still going strong. So, I figured why not just get the upgrade of the honor I had. Now I finally have a phone that works well. I would give this phone five stars, but its just a little bigger than I expected, but that's not really a problem because I also ordered a rose gold case with one of those adjustable metal rings in the back and I just keep my middle finger in there all the time so I don't drop my phone (its actually quite comfortable). So yeah I hope this review helps you make a decision and save your coins."
B078NCL7GK,Steve T.,1,"Love it at first, but 8 months into the ownership, screen starting to detached from body. I contacted support and they claimed it's a physical damage that will not be covered by warranty. I have been careful about my phone and never sat on nor dropped it. There is not a scratch on the phone and no crack on the screen."
B078NCL7GK,Zoning,5,"It is a perfect phone ever. I have briefly used honor 6x preciously, but not impressed that time because of the low end body and laggy performance. This time I decided to give it another try due to the shiny body and ovehemeingly good review. It really didn't dispoint me this time. The display is even better than I thought when I got the phone. I have heard view angle issue of phone but I don't see anything noticeable. Clarity of display are top notch!! Even feel better than iPhone 7 or 8. The performance is greatly improved from last generation. What is even better is it flies after I turned on developer option and limit the background process.
I haven't tried the camera seriously, it is ok. But if care about camera, it is not the phone for you.
I don't really have too much cons for it. The micro USB ports, lack of fast charge don't seem like a problem because I have plenty of old cable and battery is well enough for serious one day use.
One con I have is that edge of the screen is not very sensitive , but not a big issue to me.
So seriously, even without considering the fact of price, it is still a perfect daily driver phone."
B078NCL7GK,Skip,5,"Purchased this phone to replace my father's outdated SS Note 3, and he is quite happy with the upgrade. I've been an iPhone guy since the 3G back in 2008. I have to say this phone has sincerely WOW'd me for the price. I've looked up reviews and knew I was expecting a similar design to my current iPhone 7+, but for $200 I can say the display's quality is similar to my iPhone 7+, the build quality feels similar of an iPhone, the buttons for volume and lock are clicky and satisfying to press and overall better than my iPhone's buttons! (and Honor includes a FREE CLEAR CASE in box vs headphones which has more value to me imo) UMEI is a great skin, it is very iOS-like which felt very familiar out of the box, and great to have the app drawer enabled by default. Seriously the only drawback I can think of is the camera quality, for a dual lens system I was expecting a little more sharpness and color reproduction but I noticed most photos, were lacking in light/color. It gets the job done, but I highly recommend Honor/Huawei to spend the extra $ on their next model and increase the msrp by $20 to include an improved camera module and this would easily replace my iPhone next year. NO NFC so no Android Pay, but my father is very old school and could care less about it, but it could be a dealbreaker for those who frequent contactless payments. But most modern credit/debit cards are going contactless, so there's that. Anyways thanks for creating a great phone for the price Huawei you knocked it out of the park in almost every department in my book."
B078NCL7GK,Bugsoldman,1,"I needed a phone, the price was good so thought it was worth a shot. It's only been a few days and I'm not sure if I will keep it. It has many good qualities but has some major problems that could make it unusable in the future. The first is the screen doesn't respond. Sometimes it takes several tries. Also battery life is short. I start my day at 7am and the battery is dead by 4pm. I'm not a heavy user and my 3 year old phone last longer even now. But I'll give it more time and see how it goes.
Update. It's only been a week and it has lockup twice once during a phone call, and went dark once and It was hard to restart. The thing that makes me sad is I really liked this phone. It maybe a defective one but not sure I'm going to take a chance a replacement."
B078NCL7GK,Alex K.,2,"The eye catching distinguishment for the 7X is that 18:9 aspect ratio screen for the $200 price point you are paying. But there is definitely more in this budget phone than just the screen. Inside the aluminium unibody holds a Hisilicon Kirin 659 chip with 3 GB of ram and 32 GB of storage. There is micro SD card support for added space as well.

And like all Huawei and Honor phones, the 7X runs a custom skin running Android Nougat called EMUI 5.1, which weâve taken a look at often on this channel. I personally have grown used to EMUI and you can adjust the settings to make it more of a traditional android experience. Options are good especially for the budget field.

But going back to the screen, Honor is calling their 18:9 screen a âFullViewâ display which in laymens term translates to a 5.93 inch 1080p IPS display that has thin bezels on the sides. Viewing angles and colors reproduction are perfectly acceptable and are actually quite good for this price range.

Something else that is really good for the price is the build quality. Weâre very aware that Chinese phones have been providing solid budget builds for years now, but never have they been easily accessible in the western markets. This is sold on Amazon, Bestbuy and basically every accessible electronics e-commerce. The only budget aspect of the hardware is the use of micro-usb instead of USB C. Although as I said before about this phone, I do suspect most potential buyers looking at the 7X are coming from a micro usb phone anyway. Its one extra cable you have to carry for those who have made the switch to USB C with all their other electronics.

The fingerprint scanner is located a little bit on the high side on the rear of the phone. I have to alter my grip to hit it. It is rather accurate and fast to unlock though. The 7X also has one set of fingerprint gestures that allow you to bring down and up the notification shade. Little features like this that it shares with itâs more expensive Huawei siblings makes this phone feel a bit more expensive than it really is.

Now the Kirin 659 performs nowhere near where I expected it to even when considering this $200 price range. Apps are noticeably slow to load and multi-tasking is near impossible on this phone. This is one of the few phones Iâve used the last couple of years which have fully locked up on me multiple times and forced me to do a hard restart. If you have absolutely nothing running in the background though, the 7X actually has passable performance in comparison with midrangers which is a level above its pay grade.

These mixed results play in with the dual rear cameras too. Like many of the Huawei produced phones, we have a 16 MP f/2.2 sensor accompanied by a 2 MP one that lets you do some neat things with the aperture. Oh and they look like googly eyes popping out of your phone.

The camera and gallery apps are slow to launch a majority of the time. What you see here is already considered fast through my usage. Even clearing up available ram doesnât seem to speed things up for me. This is a big letdown seeing as the results of the photos are really good. I was extremely impressed with the photo quality the 7X produced. Landscape photos in optimal lighting are sharp and detailed with rather cool true colors. Iâm going to have to say this is probably the phone camera in the $100-300 range Iâve used in a couple years. It falls short in low light situations and the selfie camera adds too much processing, but overall this was a reliable camera.

Another thing that was surprisingly reliable was the 3340 mah battery which lasted me for about 14-15 hours a day. I took this 7X and pushed it to itâs limit on my recent trip to Hong Kong and it kept up, at least in the battery life department. Almost 6 Hrs of Screen on Time, which by my standards of usage is very good.

My last couple of notes before I wrap the review up is that the Honor 7X doesnât have NFC. Most budget devices donât. Iâve been using Google Pay at ATMs and stores, and ironically in Hong Kong where mobile payments are a huge norm, I brought on the trip the one phone to test that didnât have access to it."
B078NCL7GK,Caligal,3,"I really loved this phone for a while until I started having issues. The camera is not that great but I did not expect much from a 200 something phone. It looks and feels like a premium phone despite being cheap on price. When I first got it, it was kind of slow when multitasking. Other than that, it worked fine. After few months, they issued a software update which solved the slowness problem. I could not feel any lag when using normal day to day apps like browsing, Facebook, photos, maps etc. Until that point there were no major issues. Then came another software update after which the gps started having issues. It would not lock on the satellites when using maps . Even when it did occasionally lock, it lost the lock pretty fast. I have had horrible incidents where I tried to go somewhere and the GPS signal got lost and I had to stop the car and reset the phone. I did a factory reset, calibrated the compass, used gps apps to reset the gps but nothing seemed to work. I went to online forums and other people are also having similar problems.

I contacted Huawei and since the phone is under warranty, they issued me a RMA to send it in repair. Now, I have to wait until I get my phone back. They said they do not have a loaner phone that they can provide until mine gets repaired.

So bottom-line, if your phone works, it is a great bargain, but if you have to send it in for repair, prepare to have a backup phone until you get your phone back.

I will update once I get my phone back.

* Update 12/11/18 : the phone came back from repair and they did expedited shipping. Now, the GPS works but it has never worked quite fast and well like iPhone and premium phones from the very beginning. I used an old iPhone 6 plus while this was going through repairs and had gotten used to IOS. After I got this phone back, I realized that this phone is much more slimmer and is overall a better form factor than the iPhone. However, GPS was always spot on, on the iPhone.

* Update 01/29/2018 : I am having same problems with GPS again. Even though the phone was supposedly repaired under warranty. Phone still has few days warranty left so I will try to send it in for repair. I am staying away from Huawei products for sure."
B078NCL7GK,Orrin,4,"Many reviews on this device reassure you that this device is a great device for $200 but the truth is if you forget the price this device is a good device at any price compared to what is out there. You already know the specs so my experience with this phone has been great. I have had alot of smart phones high end and low end this is definitely a mid-range performing phone however for day to day usage like web browsing, watching movies and even playing games it offers a great experience especially if you haven't experienced Android 8 or the 18:9 aspect ratio as yet. The cameras are okay and can produce great photos in good lighting. Low light performance isn't great but I guess it's usable just not impressive. Am not a selfie person but I guess the same can be said for the front cameras they're good but suffers in low lighting. Gaming on this device isn't the best but it's good enough for almost everyone. the only game I play is pubg and it's runs pretty smooth but there are at time noticeable glitches but they don't hinder game play for me at lease. Build quality is great. Sound quality is solid one speaker but it's gets the job done. I have no complains about this phone. Buy it it's good. if you are looking for a flagship you know where to find them but if you are looking at this chances are your looking for something that is affordable and gets the job done this is the most affordable phone you can get that gets the job done. [After 6 months update:] the screen started to have a yellowish tint it seems to occur when the phone is placed under heat. it's 2019 I do not recommend this phone anymore"
B078NCL7GK,emmodiva,2,"If reviews are important to you, then I'll cut to the chase. I love this phone except for a huge flaw that I want corrected. If you are not into texting, then I give you my 4.5 star blessing. Mazel tov! If you are into texting a lot, keep going as I explain my low rating...

As a person who likes to own her own phone and wants the best quality at an affordable price, I researched this phone for a long time before buying. I don't like to change phones often and I don't like being held hostage at a phone company with high payments for months! So after reading some great reviews on consumer and computer magazine sites, decided to buy the Honor 7x.
Overall, I really like it! I have to take all kinds of pics for work, so the camera function was one of the most important features to consider. It really gives iPhone a run for the money. The sound quality could be better, especially louder, but it isn't poor...could just be a little more powerful. I live in New York, so sometimes in a crowd, I just cannot hear.
Why the low rating then? Because their customer service could not give me an answer to my problem!!!
Situation: I text far more than talk on the phone, so there are two time-consuming and frustrating issues going on.

1. There are several colleagues with whom I group chat using the text app that came on the phone. (They all have iPhones -don't know if that matters). Whenever we get into a dialogue, I go berserk because if I need to scroll backward to catch the beginning of the conversation, then every time one of the others responds back in real time - even if just to ""like"" what someone else said - I can't scroll anymore because the page jumps to the most current comment. So I try scrolling again, then boom! Back to the most current comment. Cant respond if I can't follow! So I just drop out all together until they stop. Then they wonder why I don't answer when they needed my feedback sooner.
2. The second issue is along those lines, but involving all texts. At any time I want to review a previous text with anyone, as I scroll backwards, the page is jerky whenever I lift my finger up to start another downward swipe to scroll. For every five or so comments I pass backwards in a scroll, then it jerks forward three more (i.e., take three steps forward, step back one). It takes forever to scroll. It's never one continuous flow. Definite glitches.

I've had this phone since April, but kept thinking a system update might fix the problem and it never did, so today I decided to contact customer service. We did a text chat on their site. At first the tech guy more or less said it was too bad: it's just how it is....maybe I should try a different app! But I shouldn't have to ask my colleagues to install a different app just so we can have a flowing text chat! I told him it was unacceptable and that I would write a negative review on Amazon. So then he wrote back with some instructions to try involving the cache. I tried it twice and it didn't work. So basically I think the company's response is I'm SOL! To me that is still not an acceptable response for such a large company, even though I know in phone world this is a cheap phone! I had an Amazon Fire Phone previously for which I paid less than this one and I never had this issue!
If Huawei people read this and can come up with a better solution that works, I will be happy to edit this review and give a 5-star rating, because in every other aspect, I'm very happy with this phone, especially given the price. I had literally spent 3 months researching phones and felt like I was making the best investment possible, so to have this type of malfunction going on is a huge disappointment and a huge waste of my time when I'm trying to conduct business."
B078NCL7GK,Chris Nicholas,4,"Bought this phone because this was the best bang for my buck. I don't have a lot of disposable income, so when I am buying a phone it has to tick the necessary boxes for me at the great price.
- Great build quality (if all goes well may be using it for 3 years plus)
- Updated to Android Oreo (not Android P but its as close to being updated as it gets without having a Google or android one phone
- Decent Battery
- Decent Camera
- 32 GB internal memory(any less is a deal breaker)
- headphone jack (another deal breaker)
- expandable memory
So it ticked the above boxes and many others, it's by no means super fast and I have noticed that there are some hiccups in usage but nothing too annoying.
Overall, it great package."
B078NCL7GK,Preston Carter,3,"I would not recommend this phone if you counted on having the ability to move apps to storage (to expand the limited 32gb of RAM for apps with Micro SD sticks). It has been a long time since that functionality was implemented on stock android, but Huawei has not enabled it in their OS. Huge disappointment for me, because otherwise the phone is quite nice.

I would suggest that everyone look at the Mate SE which has more internal memory (64gb) and RAM (3gb) making the lack of functionality less of a problem."
B078NCL7GK,Daniel Ladenburg,1,Very fragile phone. Screen cracked in the second month. I went through 3 glass screen protectors and three cases since getting the phone 14WEEKS ago. I had the previous honor and loved it...infact I'm using that one now since the honor 7 didn't survive a water incident. I'm not particularly rough with my phone. This is the first screen I've ever cracked. Who wants a phone that can't survive daily life?
B078NCL7GK,RUDY,5,"The phone is light but not too light. Its all aluminum so it feels real tight in our hand. The screen is bright and clear. Its not quite a good as the Samsung AMOLED but still pretty good. It has a small bezel and no stupid ""notch"". Here the best -This phone is FAST, LIGHTENING FAST. It can switch apps quickly, storage is adequate, the OS is simple to use - you will have no problem. It works with AT&T (any GSM carrier) and can take any SD card to expand the memory. I know it doesn't have the cache of Apple of Samsung but it also doesn't have the price tag either - and it does Everything those phones do. It runs the latest Android and gets updates faster than most. It costs $199 and you can have next day or same day if you order early. The best part for me is I own this phone. No payments plans. And there is a warranty. A 100% recommended buy."
B078NCL7GK,Putt,5,"If you want to have some cheap fun, just read reviews. Reviews of any product. Amazing. Some say it was sent from above. Some say it absolutely sucks. How can it be so opposite? Funny. The truth i think lies somewhere in the middle. I like more about the phone then i don't like about the phone. i am comparing to other phones in the same basic price range i have compared it to. Of course, this is only my personal opinion like all other reviews...

The likes and don't likes:

- I like: That it is because it has little bloat wear.
- I like: That because it is totally unlocked it works with virtually ALL phone services AND even in Europe.
- I like: The strong processor for only 199.99.
- I like: The overall quality of the phone.
- I like: The loud, clear, phone reception when speaking with someone.
- I like: The camera. Not great, but for 199.99 it is great. If it was an 800.00 phone i may give it less stars.
- I like: It is fluid and smooth when using it. The screen scrolls well, i have NEVER had it freeze as some reviews say.
- I like: As other reviews state, it is just a great phone for under 200.00. I have seen some phones that are new like this one that are dogs in comparison for the same price. After using it you would believe you have a much more expensive phone then it is.
- I like: The big screen. NICE screen too....
- I like: There are other things I like also about the phone, but will end it here..

- I don't like so much: I feel like i am getting real picky here, but i have to come up with some negative. I didn't care for the onboard email app. and text app. I found a couple of third party apps that seem to work well, so i am using those.
- I don't like so much: The fact there is no fast charging USB port.
- I don't like so much: That there are a couple of software 'leave-out's' that could be mentioned, but not worth the effort to post. Piddly little things i think for under 200.00. If it was 600.00 it would be worth the complaint.

I am going to SHOCK many people who read this review.................. I bought the phone................. TO BE A PHONE. I want to call someone and have the call quality be GOOD. The first time i used the phone my son called me who was on a business trip across the U.S. from where i am. The call was so loud and clear it was as though he was standing a few feet from me. Amazing. If I want to text someone I want it to work good. If I want to email someone I want it to work good. I want to be able to take a decent photo now and then. I could give a rats rear end whether i can play a video game. I will use my X-Box if i want to do that. IF i want to take professional pictures i will use my ""Camera"" for that. I want a phone to be a PHONE first and foremost. I occasionally have need to Google something when i am out and about. I want it to not crap out on me while i am in a browser. I want the processor to power through and not die on me and the phone freeze while trying to surf some website. This one has been super in that regard. From that standpoint this phone works GREAT. All the other goodies are all pluses...

So the overall review for me is that phone, for the price deserves 5 stars. How could i NOT give it 5 stars? it is a great phone for 200 bucks. Unbelievable really. That is why it is so highly rated. Do the math. It has much more in features then not. Did i mention it is just plain outright good looking phone too. I love how the processor powers through everything i have thrown at it most of all.....

FOOTNOTE:

This is a foot note my first review above. I have had the phone for over a month and it has worked just super. Happy with it as can be other then the negatives i gave it, which really were not negatives at all. Something i found out that worked for me regarding the BATTERY not holding up as advertised. I bought the phone with ""Nougat 7.0."" I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers that said they found that before you do anything, you immediately install the 8.0 upgrade. THEN after doing the upgrade IMMEDIATELY do one more reset of the phone.

I found that initially my battery did not seem to hold up well as i expected. I was a little disappointed. I did as one reviewer suggested and reset my phone one more time. I noticed a REAL difference how the battery performed. No doubt about it. It made a real difference. 1. IF you buy the phone new do the update FIRST THING. Before doing anything. IF you have had the phone for a while, still do the reset. 2. RESET the phone AFTER the update. Made a difference for me just as the reviewer suggested..."
B078NCL7GK,Madeline,5,"I love this phone! It's my second $200 phone (the first was the galaxy j7 prime) and this one is miles better. The camera is much better and that was my biggest concern. The screen is really big but it's still easy to use one-handed. The fingerprint scanner is incredibly well placed and works immediately every time. The battery also easily lasts all day and I'm on my phone constantly. Something kind of funny is that the stock keyboard come with what I assume is Chinese emojis and they're hilarious.

I originally came from the galaxy s7 edge and this phone really doesn't feel like that much of a step down for saving $700 dollars. The camera isn't as good but that's a lot of money too pay for a camera. As you can tell, I've been a Samsung girl for a while and switching to an almost stock Android has been great. I always thought I liked the little changes Samsung made but now I think they would just get in the way.

There are a few cons. First is that you need to either put the free case on it or get a screen protector immediately. The corners of the front screen got scratched up after having the phone for less than a day just from setting it face down on tables. Also, Snapchat occasionally runs slow. And finally, I would suggest resetting your phone every so often because it does get bogged down sometimes."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"This is the third Honor xX I have had. My wife and I each got a 5x, I got the 6x while she was still using the 5x. After a departure to other androud devices in the same price range I'm very happy to be back with the Honor brand. My last phone before this was the Revvl... By far the biggest pos I have ever had, and it cost $40 more then the 7x.

The new phone is thinner, lighter and easier to use one handed. I'm 6'4' and have pretty big hands. My wife at 5'1"" can also single habdes us the phone. I believe it has to do with the new aspect ratio. Seems taller and thinner than the old ones.

Fast, bright and beautiful. Don't think you can do much better at the price."
B078NCL7GK,Dimitri,5,"I have been using it for quite a bit now and I absolutely LOVE it! My phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy S5 and I had has all the previous ones of that so I was a little nervous to go with a different kind of phone. To be honest, I like it even better! The picture quality could be better but it's not bad for everyday use! It's better than the S5 for sure, more comparable to the S4 which I loved as well.
I haven't had any issues with the phone as of yet! There is a ton of memory which is good for me because I take a TON of pictures! Internet capability is great and I have no issues! It does have a google keyboard and is google-based, which I do not mind. I would definitely buy this again, best money I have spent on a phone yet!"
B078NCL7GK,Rob Jr.,4,"I've had this phone for about 7 months now and I really enjoy it for the money. I previously had an iPhone 6 plus that was just not aging well and needed a new phone but didn't want to pay the premium price. After looking around, I came across this one and took a chance.

I already knew I wanted to switch to Android so that wasn't an issue for me. I work in digital art so having a large screen mattered most and the screen size on this was bigger than my iPhone so that was a big relief. Finger print sensor on the back was much more convenient than on the front and I quickly got used to it. Love that it has expandable storage, a headphone jack, and is very thin and light weight. Not having fast charging or being water resistant isn't that important to me especially at this price point. I haven't had it previously, so I don't miss it. A lot of people are put off with it using micro USB instead of USB type C, but even as a former iPhone user I ended up with more micro USB cables than lightning cables so I'm actually glad I can put all those cables to use and don't have to carry different types when on the go. At the time of this review, most electronics and accessories still use them so it's fine for the time being.

Pictures come out alright but it seems like there is some kind of Instagram filter that makes everything paler and if anything moves slightly there will be a blur. Sound isn't great either and headphones don't make it any better, so audiophiles will be disappointed. My main issue with this phone is that we got the 3/32 version instead of the 4/64 version like other countries get. This phone lags and crashes frequently and I think the extra memory would've helped tremendously. I can fully understand having to cut corners and that there will be things that need to be comprised especially for what this phone costs, but if I know that other countries are getting a better version for roughly the same price then it's not going to get a five star review.

All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase and can't wait for the next model to come out. If you are like me and think that smartphones reached a level of refinement that works for you a few years back, then this is a great purchase."
B078NCL7GK,Sergio,1,"At the beginning a five stars phone. It's nice; well designed, but one month later everything it's changing. The camera takes a long time to open. Sometimes the touch screen does not respond. The pictures quality's are not like a 16 mp camera. The Bluetooth connection works but I lose the connection with my smartwatch each 15 or less minutes. If I turn off the Bluetooth or the phone I can not reconect again the watch. I have to start pairing again and again several times. I do not recommend this phone. It's a nice face but it's like cheap Chinese phone.. Try Nokia; Samsung or other brands. I am sorry for my English.
Updating may 25: due problems with the bright I tried to send the phone to the warranty center. I had to call them about seven times and took them six days to send me a simple email with the return label shipping. I decided do not send because they do not like very serious . I do not recommend to buy this phone. The phone is good but if you need use the warranty you are going to find is not easy"
B078NCL7GK,crystalattice,5,"Just got this yesterday and I really like the phone so far. Previously I had an LG G5 but, after less than 18 months, the fingerprint reader stopped working, the power button was iffy, the software seemed to be getting slower, and overall the phone became a paperweight; I couldn't even get it to properly connect to the Honor 7 to do a proper data transfer.

So far, the Honor 7 is worth more than it cost. The power button is separate from the fingerprint reader, and is actually in a good location on the side of the case. The inherent functionality of the OS is great. I can use fingerprint, double-tap, or power button to turn it on; the fingerprint reader doubles as a swiping mechanism to register gestures; the keypads can be changed for one-handed operation; etc.

The OS appears to receive updates fairly quickly from the mainline Android tree; I believe it was less than a week before Android Oreo was made available to users. An added plus, in my eyes, is the inclusion of a standard headphone jack; it's nice being able to use cheaper headphones rather than having to either carry a BT set with me, or buying multiple ones for home/work, with the inherent issue of charging.

The single biggest complaint I have now is the lack of USB-C, but that's only because the G5 had it and I was used to it. Using regular USB Micro isn't horrible, as I have plenty of cables available."
B078NCL7GK,A Brown,5,So far so good. Had this phone for almost 2 weeks and I think it is a good phone. This is an upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S5. I am not a super techy person and am past the point in my life when I was willing to pay big $$ for a flagship phone. I researched phones for awhile and decided to take a chance on the Honor 7X since the predecessor did pretty well. Glad I did. No regrets so far.
B078NCL7GK,Jon,5,"* UPDATE *

ALL MY FAULT. DROPPED IT ON CONCRETE WHILE NIGHT WALK WITH MY DOG. CRACKED MY SCREEN. DRATS! THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST LOW END$ PHONE I'VE EVER PURCHASED. tip: I gave up on included clear case ... Never a problem ... Of course until it is hard dropped. KEEP CLEAR CASE ON ALWAYS.

UPDATE NOV 29 2018
Still very happy with the phone. I'm not a gamer, but the old school quick games do LAD (Zuma - color balls streaming ... Really lags. Free game worked on all other lesser phones, but that I notice (but for me, I don't care).

BATTERY still surprised me how fast it recharges. Great battery life. THIS BRAND HAS FLAWLESS! FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION!
Speakers could be louder, but not a tech, music, game, photo person.

UPDATE: OCT 2, 2018
>> Compared to 6x THIS HONOR 7X HAS WAY WAY WAY! BETTER CELL SERVICE/CONNECTION WITH T-MOBILE. So much better (works everywhere in my home, but with 6x, had many indoor dead spots). Great regular phone w/T-.obile. upped to 5 stars.

First: I have had excellent experience with the HONOR phones, unlocked, no service plan, but pay as you go via T-mobile has saved me a fortune.

HONOR 7: WAS VERY WITH HONOR 6X but with all new smart phones, they start out fast, and between APP updates, New Apps for new needs (smart door bell for example) .. it was just too burden and needy for better processor & ram (and a new phone seems the only way to get the BLOAT WEAR that unknowingly get into your system, hide, and slow everything.

I especially liked the idea of the larger screen on the honor7 over the 6x.

1. DON'T GET TOO EXCITED FOR THE LARGER SCREEN:
- you can choose to apply or not to each Android app. It is just more vertical space & MOST Android Apps are made for the normal non extended screen. It adds no usable space for MOST APPS
>> But it does leave an unused horizontal portion, that just perfectly accommodates those ANNOYING SPAMMY ADD POP UPS THAT HAVE MOVING IMAGES (LIKE CHERIES FROM A SLOT MACHINE with flashing in a narrow but edge to edeg box about the size of an empty headline box for review headlines.

THUS ... THE SIZE INCREASE IS NEUTRAL TO ANNOYING AND REALLY IRRITATING WITH SOME OF THE POPUPS.

ALSO, ALL THE VIDEOS I HAVE, OR HAVE WATCHED STREAMING, ALSO ARE FORMATTED FOR THE NORMAL SIZE PHONE SCREEN, SO MOST FULL SCREEN VIDEO WATCHING HAS TO BLACK ""pillars"" on each side of the video screen.

2. HONOR HAS LONG HAD THE MOST AMAZING FINGERPRINT TECH. IT ALWAYS READ A PRINT, ANALYSES IT ISLNSTANTLY, AND THE PHONE UNLOCKS. (side note, try washing your hand in hot water, dry them and the finger print I'd picks up the natural slight swelling of skin to hot water& and will reject your fingerprint until fully dry and cooled back down. It sounds bad, I just just think it's interesting).

PERFORMANCE:
it will take some time before you can even try out it's performance. There is a major update to 8.0 I think, along with having to get, migrate, transfer or reload all you apps and all but a few require screen name and password with no auto fill, for app after app, after app.

ME: THERE WERE TWO TERRIBLE GLITCHES DURING SETUP (I don't know what caused it) but apps we're popping open and closed, while others piled up open and freezing the screen all touch sensors and can only reboot with the full 15 second undisturbed constant hold my the power button.
It seems like a so what, but there is no warning, you phone and setup seem in peril, and may happen again.

BUT IN THE 36 or so hours since it was fully charged, there was much greater speed of apps & the ability to have more open at once than my previous 6x.

I will update as It goes. It is thinner and sleaker than the 6x, but I don't use my phone as a fashion accessory.
(and no matter how you transfer apps ... There is always that AMAZON not being ""universal"" with apps not bought/downloaded from Amazon app store ... Which leads me to forget, you have to find the Amazon app store app itself via the chrome browser and not via the Amazon Shopping Store App(s) that may be there. I wish Amazon would give up on trying to get a kind of Monopoly on their apps store. Google has so far exceeded and dominates Android apps, Amazon will never get anything but loyal Amazon customers like myself, repeatedly annoyed & irritated when some app gets pissy because you removed any one of several Amazon specific apps (I use Amazon for everything, but I still don't need or use all the apps and services Amazon offers. (I am not a reader, and if I did want to read one of the hundred of Amazon book stored in Amazon's cloud (all free and collected over years when a freebee book showed up) because I am now over 50 years old ... And people, it's real ... All the sudden and really fast they get bad, and daily it seems my vision worsens .. so a phone would been too hard to read from ( if I ever did read).

I would NOT say to run away from this phone if considering it, but neither would I give a full thumbs up as there are things yet to learn)

AS FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION. THE UPGRADE TO 8 HAS IT. IT'S KINDA D STUPID USELESS. FIRST YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE POWER BUTTON TO TELL THE PHONE TO TURN ON CAM AND CHECK (WHICH IT DOES FAST) BUT THE FINGERPRINT ID IS SO MUCH FASTER. A LIGHT SWIPE ALERTS THE PHONE TO CHECK ID, WHICH IS INSTANT. THE FACIAL RECOGNITION TAKES STEPS ... AND THEN IT SHOWS YOU OWN PIC WHEN CONFIRMED. I AM NOT PHOTOGENIC AND A BAD SELFIE LOOKING AT ME WHEN I TURN MY PHONE ON EACH TIME IS NOT ENJOYABLE AT ALL)"
B078NCL7GK,Dakota,4,"I absolutely love being able to flex to friends and coworkers that I paid $200 for the same features that they have on their $1k phones. The phone is very stable and smooth, the aesthetics are great. The UI is awesome and clean, at the same time as very customizable. I 11/10 would recommend this phone to anybody and everybody. Huawei should be a AAA brand alongside with Apple and Samsung.

The only cons to this phone that i've noticed after a few months is maybe the picture quality when zooming is a little rough, and the on-board speakers are a big OOF; but honestly are you going to ever use the built in speakers?"
B078NCL7GK,Wei Ren,5,"Great phone for $200. Comes with a clear tpu case as well. Very nice android phone for the price. Just don't expect too much, does have occasional hiccups on some apps."
B078NCL7GK,Lakshya,5,"This is the most expensive phone I've ever bought so perhaps take my review with a grain of salt. I absolutely LOVE it. Normally I don't pay more than $50-$100 for a phone, but I can definitely see what I've been missing out on. It's lightning quick and I noticed that people were complaining about the camera, but I think it's excellent and it fascinates me how it can give me a crisp, detailed image upon max zooming in on an object.

I was debating between this and the Mate SE, but I didn't want to pay $50 more for just a 1 GB RAM upgrade. 3 GB RAM is more than enough for what I need. I also bought a 128 GB microSD card to bump up total storage to 160 GB for my music and pictures.

FYI this fits 2 nano-sims and 1 microSD. My carrier is Lycamobile."
B078NCL7GK,Nicolas Rinn,1,"This phone was great, I bought it four months ago and it worked very nicely except for a couple Bluetooth and lag hiccups. Nothing terrible. Then all of a sudden it started rebooting randomly and now it barely turns on before it reboots. Terrible."
B078NCL7GK,Naomi Alvarado,5,Amazing phone for $200 this is my second one had the 5x now 7x is fast I don't need a$500 phone looks great feels great and fast
B078NCL7GK,Anirban Mitra,5,"I am using honor 7x from last 7 days. I am very satisfied after using this. I was using samsung galaxy j7 prime, but suddenly it's mother board crashed. It was asking for $150 to replace that, I was searching all the way and came across about honor 7x. At first I was bit hesitant, after reading reviews I purchased this, with $200, it is really a flagship phone. Camera quality is pretty good both front and back. It has finger sensor, face sensor, pattern match, security lock code. It is very sleek mode, pretty first as per performance, very good looking, touch screen is very sensitive which I personally like very much. Even I installee 2 3 games and it did not degrade any performance.
Though some of the features has some challenges like it does not have oled display which we can bear without that,
It doesnot contain snapdragon, battery charging is not fast. But battery stays long with this phone.
So for overall honor 7x is a hit model according to me and it is really worth to have a phone like this in this money."
B078NCL7GK,Edwin J.,5,"Screen: The screen is bright and colorful, but I think it's LCD and not IPS as the viewing angles aren't the best, but even then it looks fine.

Camera: The default camera app is trash. I downloaded HedgeCam2 and activated Camera2 API and some advanced options like saving in RAW. In this mode, the pictures are really sharp and clear after editing them in Lightroom Mobile (Snapseed works well too). It makes the pics taken in the default app look like they were taken with a potato, especially in low light conditions. I really recommend taking your time to do this as the phone takes better pictures that you may realize at first glance.

The Dual Camera is a joke as it doesn't look that good, the blurry part looks more like it's 5 Mpix than 16. Honestly, it's just there for marketing, like in most budget phones, but if you're into blurry effects on your selfies, I guess you can get some use out of it.

Video: Limited to 1080p by the default camera app, you can go a bit higher with an app like HedgeCam2 (2048x1080 or 2K).

Speed: Seems fluid so far, but that's because it's new. I will update this review as it gets slower (or not) after some use.

Customization: This phone comes with EMUI and I'm not a fan of it, but it works well. Hopefully, future updates will make it better.

The main things you look for in a phone these days: Screen, camera, speed, stability. All of it is fine on this phone and for 200$ that's great, the camera is a win if you take your time to learn how to get the most out of it.

P.D: This is not my phone, it's my sister's, but I tested it just like if it were mine."
B078NCL7GK,KaboomOxyCln,1,"I got the Honor 7x because I really enjoyed the 5x. The first 5 months were great. Then I started getting GPS lost, which while annoying wasn't a total deal breaker. Now (month 8) the phone is completely unusable. The phone will randomly freeze up with any amount of usage and reboot for anywhere from 12 to 45 minutes. And good look trying to get Huawei/Hihonor to honor the warranty."
B078NCL7GK,Joel Kuhn,1,"If you check messages or change tracks from your lock screen ignore this phone. Huawei makes it impossible to expand notifications on the lock screen with their recent updates. Oh, but Android allows apps to create different groups of notifications so that player notifications don't get collapsed with other app notifications right? Nope. Huawei decided to group all app notifications regardless of what app developers specify. Ok, but you can disable non-player notifications so your music/podcast player doesn't get collapsed into them right? Nope, that _is_ an option, but if you disable one notification type on the lock screen, it disables all lock screen notifications for that app, because apparently Huawei just puts out broken software.

Uless Huawei stops breaking Android, I absolutely can't recommend this phone."
B078NCL7GK,Jumpin Jehosaphat,4,"So far so good. It booted fine, ran through the setup and got me logged into Google. The expected bloatware was there naturally but I was surprised to be able to uninstall a lot of it. It came with Android 7.0, but 8 was available for immediate download. One thing I'm really liking is the fingerprint sensor. It's on the back where your index finger naturally finds it and unlocking the phone that way is very fast and easy. The only hitch I had was my old sim is a micro sim and this phone requires a nano sim. I'll have to go to the Cricket store and get a new one.

Edit: The Oreo and GUI download went just swimmingly and Cricket was glad to charge me $10.50 for a SIM card. One thing I can't get working though is the notification LED. It works when charging, but I can't get it to flash for any notifications. I Googled the problem and one solution was to wipe the cache partition. That didn't work, although I did get a bunch of texts that hadn't come through before. Today I did a factory reset and that didn't work either. It's in the software someplace. Maybe they'll fix it with an update at some point.

Edit 2: Apparently the Notification LED only works with the screen off. I got red, blue, and green to work with Chomp.

Edit 3. I get much better reception with this phone than I did with my LG-G4. Usually 1 to 2 bars better in fringe areas."
B078NCL7GK,Ladybug,5,"I will only ever be in the low end of Android phones, but this really is a good phone, and great for the price. (Prime Day deal!!)
Going from a Moto G3, I really am pleased at how much faster things run on this phone. I actually do like their version of Android.

I'm pleasantly surprised by the camera as well. I would imagine that anyone who's had an iPhone or Pixel would find it to be slow or whatever. But this is just a nice little phone that takes decent pics, and allows me to run several apps without it crashing. I imagine heavy duty gamers and such would probably not enjoy it, I just want to be able to listen to music and have one or two other apps running."
B078NCL7GK,John Huff,5,"This is a GREAT Android device for the price. We were hesitant as the on line reviews trashed the camera, but that's just NOT true. This camera is great. Takes nice NORMAL pictures. We are not too interested in taking photos in the dark, or underwater... just nice family event photos. This one excels at everything. Great screen, good looks, fast processor and a fast fingerprint scanner to unlock the device.
The ONLY thing that MAY be a deal breaker for some is the lack of NFC. Google Pay won't work here.
It also is a dual sim phone but we elected to put in a 128GB Micro SD card into that slot. This, together with the 32 GB on board, gives us a total of 160 GB of storage.
No dumb ""Bloatware"" either... almost a pure android OS that we came to love over some manufacturer's ""skins"" that do nothing more than duplicate what Google has already done... and done much better too.
Friends have already mistaken it for a new ""Something, Something 9"" phone that costs $500. more.
Nope.... and we are very happy that it is what it is."
B078NCL7GK,ari,3,"(OLD REVIEW NEW ONE BENEATH)I'm ONLY giving this device 3 stars because it's so pretty! The screen is just gorgeous, and on first impressions (just got it in the mail) but man...it won't let me connect to wifi so not sure what to do now. I've been googling stuff for a few hours with no luck. So yeah :/

OKAY SO AN UPDATE: It connected to the wifi like right after this but I wanted to wait a bit before updating this review just in case. ALSO want to add: this baby has amazing standby; I literally leave it on when I leave for work in the morning, and returning at 7pm it still has between 100-98% So yeah...definitely keeping for the moment. Only thing is, when I restart the device sometimes it takes a couple tries before it connects. So yeah."
B078NCL7GK,KDL,5,This is probably the best phone I have ever owned. Coming from a Samsung Galaxy S5 is like going from a Corolla to a Porshe!
B078NCL7GK,Jonathan Andrews,5,"First of all build quality is on par with flagships. Fingerprint reader works great, screen is great and visible in direct sunlight. Battery holds up all day with plenty to spare with non gaming use and the processor is fast. The camera is excellent, it works well in low light and the dual cameras bokeh effect is spot-on. Zero regrets with this purchase."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I bought this as a prime deal and paid $166 for it. This outperforms my old iPhone 5C in nearly every way. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the slow charging battery and the less than ideal sound quality. When you use the aux Port with headphones the sound quality is reeeeeally bad, even with the best quality headphones. It sounds like an old radio. No bass, and no fullness to the sound. But even though the battery charged slowly it is very long lasting. I would say this is a solid 4/5 star product.

The photos are clear, selfies mode has a built in beauty filter that evens your skin tone and such. There's a fingerprint unlock feature on the back of the phonr, very cool. I love the blue color, and the screen is huge. Also, as a bonus, the box included a clear silicone case and a lanyard. I still got a separate case for it anyway, but it's great that they included that.
I highly recommend this product. But be sure to buy a case and screen protector."
B078NCL7GK,Molly Millions,4,"Just arrived - review might change after some use. But, first impressions are that this is a very nice, near flagship quality phone. In the past, I've had Samsungs, Xiaomis, a variety of off-brand (in the US market, at least) phones like Cubot, etc... and this is the only phone I've used so far that seems to rival the 2nd gen Xiaomi that I was using a few years ago.

I promised myself after my last phone (a vendor-locked Samsung Galaxy S7) that I would never again purchase a US market phone, nor a Korean branded phone - I have no idea how most Americans tolerate the crap Samsung & their telecom cronies sell. I am not disappointed in this decision.

FYI: I live in the US (rural New England) and get adequate 4G LTE service via AT&T. Any issues with connectivity are - as I know from much experience - AT&T's fault, not any manufacturer. However, service overall is 10x better with an unlocked phone. You'll be sorry if you put that SIM into a US-market retail phone from AT&T!!! Buy unlocked!"
B078NCL7GK,Nelson M,3,"The phone was ok. I have mostly used high spec flagship phones but I needed a phone in a pinch but this want what I wanted. There was quite a few things to like about this phone, like the finger print reader on the back which is super fast and accurate. The screen brightness was good fit a lower end phone.
But just after a few days the phone started to feel laggy. I don't much care for the EMUI skin that Huawei puts on top of Android. I feel like this may have been one of the reasons for the lag. I bought another phone that was cheaper with no skin on top of Android Avd they was running Android 8.0 Avd ir Geely like it ran another then this one. I have since passed out in to my daughter but she still is quite enjoying that phone."
B078NCL7GK,Lisa,5,"Great display, takes Micro Sd, has Gorilla Glass, & comes with clear case in the box. Very happy with my decision to buy the Honor 7X!"
B078NCL7GK,Jb sims,5,This is a wonderful phone. I'm a tech person and the phone works flawlessly with big ram the screen is very beautiful and big the battery is very large last me about whole day. Definitely would buy a again
B078NCL7GK,Shante Wilson,4,Great phone for the price. I definitely miss a few thing about my old phone this one doesn't have. Like copy and paste drawer and it connectivity issue to WiFi and Bluetooth. But for $200 but deal out there
B078NCL7GK,Electro Geek,5,"This is the absolute best phone at the current price mark. If you like multitasking however, depending on the apps you are using, you might have some issues with speed. I used a remote desktop app to control numerous computers while on the phone, and noticed significant lagging. However most phones would be much slower under that kind of workload. For the everyday user, this phone is an amazing buy. Do not listen to people when they say that this phone does not take good pictures and video. Out of the box, it is great for pics and vids. There are plenty of apps that can take the camera to higher levels of quality as well. The only thing I do not like about having this phone is.....Huawei does not issue updates quickly or consistently for the US version of this phone. All other versions seem to get updates, but not the United States version. Outside of this small issue, the phone is a must buy for anyone on a budget. Huawei has the potential to take over the US market, provided our government allows them to make deals with the major phone carriers. Go ahead if you are thinking about this......and buy this phone. You will love it!"
B078NCL7GK,Zach Carmichael,5,"My wife needed a replacement phone after her Nexus 6P was biting the dust with its abysmal battery life. We got the Honor 7X on Prime Day and also bought screen protectors and a couple cases -- we paid right at $200 for everything. I transferred her data and disabled the minimal bloatware on the phone. It runs like a dream for a $200 phone with little to no lag for everyday usage. She plays Pokemon GO and some other casual games (Catan, Ticket to Ride, etc.) on it and they run butter smooth. The screen is fantastic for the price and colors pop out. Battery is probably the best feature though -- she is able to consistently have quite a bit of battery left by the end of the day after moderate usage (playing Pokemon GO, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.). This phone honestly holds its own against 2018 flagships and is a far better deal. Think of it this way -- for the price of a Galaxy Note 9, you can have 5-6 Honor 7X phones. It blows my mind that you can get this quality of phone for such a low price now."
B078NCL7GK,Eric Hill,5,"This phone is an amazing value! I took my SIM card out of my other phone and placed it in my Honor 7X and it just...worked. Towards the end of my work day, my signal was in and out. I took it to the T-Mobile store and the man there adjusted a couple settings and this phone gets reception and network speed seemingly better than my old T-Mobile device! On top of that, I received two updates for my OS which says they're making sure my phone stays working and up-to-date.
The options and capabilities of the phone are multifold. I haven't really explored half of what it's able to do, but then again, I only do certain things with my phone...but to know I have options available for use in case my needs change, is great.
The phone just worked seamlessly out of the box. My profile transferred and my apps. It was just an easy and non-time-consuming experience."
B078NCL7GK,Talon Estes,4,"This phone is perfect for the price. When you first turn it on, the screen will catch you by surprise because it'll look really damn weird, but you'll get used to it and after you get used to it, it'll look pretty freaking awesome. Performance is nice and I've only noticed occasional hiccups when I use snapchat and Facebook messenger at the same time. Not a problem. The camera leaves something to be desired and I honestly think they slapped the second camera on to be able to say it has a dual camera... You can get much better pictures with phones that have one camera but it still gets the job done... It's better than most in the price range but I think the ZTE Axon Mini's camera has it beat. (and it's cheaper)"
B078NCL7GK,Karina,5,"I just began using this phone and the rating might change if I experience any early problems (within the first year of use). Right of the bat I can say it is a good phone at a great price considering its size, features and memory (about 19GB is available for use). It does not contain an insane amount of bloated apps and allows you to uninstall a significant amount, it is unlocked and works with AT&T, it has a very good camera and its very light and thin without feeling cheap. The fingerprint sensor actually works and just recognizes only the finger I registered which is pretty cool. It comes with a plastic case which I will not use as I donât think it offers proper protection, but curiously does not include headphones which is not a big deal."
B078NCL7GK,NO ONE,5,"I have had iphones,top samsung phones, the One plus One, you name it and will never, ever spend that type of money again as this phone is just as good or better for one third (1/3) of the money....OR more... what a joke... NOW if the underwear you are wearing are some fancy label and $300 dollars and that is important to you to have a ridiculously expensive label you can not even see...then go ahead get ripped off.....OR stop being so stupid, stop being a sheep and quit wasting your money and buy this phone."
B078NCL7GK,J. White,2,"While there are some pretty cool features, I won't even address them because a few neato features are not worth the sheer frustration and mental anguish this phone causes me daily. I can't begin to postulate the number of times I have checked and rechecked settings that this device ignores at random. It just stops obeying the settings! Even when I know I haven't changed a thing, it just stops doing what I told it to do previously. I have done multiple searches for fixes to find that I'm doing everything right. It's the phone that's wrong.

For instance, this piece of crap has recently decided to stop alerting me when I get a text. I haven't changed a thing. It simply stopped notifying me. It doesn't even show up on the messaging icon when I open the phone. I have to go into messaging to see if there are any new texts. And this is after it stopped letting me see text and email previews on the lock screen. I have it set to show me previews, and it used to, but it just stopped doing so a few months ago and I can't make it start again. There are certain apps that I never EVER get notifications for. Not once. Even though I have never changed the settings that say ""yes, please notify me of anything at all"". I have done system updates. I have restarted the darn thing. I have tried it all.

I'm pretty sure this phone is a narcissistic sociopath. It does what it wants to regardless of my wants or needs and it changes it's mind on a whim without a care as to whom it hurts in the process.

I hate this GD phone."
B078NCL7GK,Kaittt,1,"I have Cricket and after being through several of their phones in four months, I figured I had nothing left to lose.

This thing is great!! It downloaded my 3 banking apps, credit card app, credit karma, Facebook, messenger, and pages all under six minutes. The UI is quite pleasant, as is all of the customization you can do to the phone itself. It's speedy and efficient, and feels like an expensive phone.

No wonder Huawei is so big in Europe and India.

UPDATE:
After a month of heavy use I still enjoy this phone. It can be a little laggy and get hot if I'm running too many apps. I am pleased to say that it isn't glitchy often at all; it has only froze on me once.
No dropped call complaints, and everything is clear and still running well.

UPDATE: Here we are, April 4th and my Bluetooth doesn't work. The phone has been in a case and screen protector since day one. It's a huge shame I need Bluetooth for my business and after less than three full months of use a critical part of something for me is now broken."
B078NCL7GK,Autumn Ann,5,"Seriously love this phone! I always lose/break phones, so it didn't make financial sense to keep buying iPhones/Samsungs. So, I tried out the 6x. Once I broke that (because I',m a mess), I upgraded to this one. It is SO MUCH BETTER. It has basically the same functions as an iPhone (face unlock, screen recording, etc.). It is also durable. Like I mentioned, I am a mess, and I've dropped this phone already quite a few times. No breaks! I only have the case that it comes with, and it works so well!"
B078NCL7GK,Katie S. Binford,1,"The few minutes I got to spend with this phone before it updated to Oreo seemed promising.
But after updating this phone to Oreo, I had two major deal-breaker issues:

1. The screen dims to different levels depending on what screen you are on: like in apps or even Settings.
--- Other people are having this issue; go search ""honor 7x oreo screen dims"" on Google. Look for the XDA Developers Forum link (should be at the top).
2. Desktop(home screen?) widgets do not automatically update/refresh.
--- Search Google for ""oreo update mega thread honor7x reddit"", navigate to the Reddit page, and use Find on the page to locate ""widgets not updating under Oreo"".
--- You can also read posts about this on the EMUI Facebook page (@HuaweiEMUI).

I don't think these issues are hardware related so maybe these issues will be fixed by Huawei in the future. Your mileage may vary, but be wary before taking the plunge!"
B078NCL7GK,Roman,4,"Pros:
- Nice feel in a hand (like flagship smartphone)
- battery life (around 6 hours screen on time
- design
- everything works great (expect notifications)

Cons
-notification center is lagging (I hope it will be fixed after updates)
- camera lit bit slow and it look like paint, not photo.
-no fast charging and USB C port

But anyway I'm happy with this smartphone for 200$"
B078NCL7GK,Mary,5,"This is the best phone I've ever had, especially for the price. The high resolution makes it so clear. The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly. Haven't played too much with the camera, but with the two pictures I took, they seemed really good. Not the best picture quality obviously, but still really good considering it's a budget phone. The battery life is really good for me. I use it all day throughout work listening to music and podcasts, as well as get on facebook and such during breaks, and when I come home around 5:30pm, I'll stilll have about 50-60% battery left. Seriously, if you can afford the $200, get this phone. Especially if you use a lot apps. I use a lot of apps for school and social media and for digital books. This phone is great."
B078NCL7GK,Robert Oliver,3,"For the most part this is a nice phone. It looks great, and the fingerprint scanner is really nice and fast. The processor seems snappy so far, but the benchmarks show the GPU is pretty weak. The lack of fast charge and 5g WiFi is a bit of a bummer, but I knew that going in.

What I didn't know was that the wifi speed is incredibly slow if you simply have Bluetooth enabled. Speed tests put it under 5 mb with bt on, and over 60 with it off. I'm not sure if it's just my unit, but the audio via Bluetooth is really bad. Tested across three devices and it just has a distorted sound through this one. Wired earbuds sound just fine though.

All in all, it's a nice, attractive phone for $200, but the poor wifi with bt on, and the audio via bt makes it feel pretty disappointing for my needs."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Solid phone for the price. Sometimes I read the reviews and get a little nervous because it seems there are all these problems big and small but I have nothing but a smooth experience. For the price, you get Android 8 which is solid. Phone is fast and smooth with Face ID, touch ID, two cameras on the back that give you AMAZING photos akin to the iPhone X photos my friend takes with his phone. The default applications are surprisingly solid and the best part: if you don't like it because youre on Android you can download a myriad of applications to replace the defaults! I love the default camera and gallery apps because they have amazing features. The feel and build of the phone is incredibly satisfying; I sometimes just enjoy looking at the phone because of how awesome it looks. I like the built in themes option for easily switching to other icon and overlay themes. I haven't had such a fast, sleek, and modern phone for such a cheap price ever: budget phones have finally caught up!
Touch ID and Face ID are incredibly fast and you get 3GB of RAM which means no slow downs or problems. Phone Manager is actually pretty cool and for such a high tech phone, the battery life is phenomenal: rarely do I have to worry about battery life.
I am wholly satisfied with the phone and I think most negative reviews are simply expecting a lot out of the phone. Its amazing for the price and does everything you need and plus some"
B078NCL7GK,Stephen Quinn,5,"Absolutely in love with this phone. From build material to screen size, speed, picture quality, battery life, it has so much going on for so little price. If all you do is Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and text and call, this phone is freaking perfect. The call quality is excellent, and the texting is a seamless change from my iPhone 6. Although I do miss iMessage a bit. This phone is miles better than that phone though. With this version you get 3GB RAM and 32 storage, or for $50 more you can buy the 4GB 64 storage...but for all I do, this one is perfect. It was $212 after taxes and make sure to check FREE SHIPPING at checkout because this automatically checks a shipping cost of like $10 extra dollars. The phone took about a week to arrive. One negative is the packaging...it was loosely packed in a way too big box. But the phone was flawless. Probably thanks to the metal construction. It also comes with a plastic gell case. The camera quality is OK. def good for the price and better than most. Hardly any bloatware too...so many good things to say so I'm rambling. Just buy it already and you won't go back to the iPhone! I get a lot of compliments on it too asking what it is. It's HUGE and looks like a flagship phone. 5+ stars"
B078NCL7GK,Dominic Agneta,5,"Really great phone for the price. I used to have an iphone but switched and I am so glad I did. This phone has a headphone jack, which is really nice because I use that occasionally. But It also has a really nice fingerprint sensor which is super fast, really nice build, loud speakers, decent cameras, and processor and ram that doesn't show any lagging for me. Very glad I bought this phone. Recommend it to all my friends. Only cons that exist because you are spending $800 dollars less: Not superb camera, no imessage because no IOS, and not insane processor and RAM, but I only noticed lagging on my old iphone. I've had the phone for 6 months now, and no aging has been apparent. Still super fast, and still super good battery."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,3,"Phone purchased on July 12th, Recieved on July 19th. And stated to use it on July 27th. It is indeed a nice little budget phone which provides what you need to get going. No it doesnt compare to the super exensive phones, but it holds its own.

The main issues I am having with it though is
1)the switch from wifi to mobile data. If I dont restart it, it will no longer go on mobile data once I take it off wifi. And even after restarting it, it takes a bit of patience not to get pissed off while it takes its time to adjust to mobile data.
2) and sometimes after ending a call, again I must restart to get my mobile data going.

So 2 stars out fot that."
B078NCL7GK,RV_Pilot,5,"I bought this Honor 7x to replace my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 which stopped accepting charges even on new batteries - probably a worn usb port on the phone itself. When the phone arrived I could hardly believe the value for the money (under $190 shipped). The screen is nearly as large and crisp as my Note 4, which was a $950 phone when new. Instead of boring you with a repeat of the impressive specs others have rightly posted on this phone, let me share a sobering fact that punched me in the gut when comparing the numbers against ""flagship"" phones.

Three and a half years ago my Samsung Note 4 was $950 and Samsung no longer supports this (former flagship) phone. Even though it still works flawlessly for me, I will never receive operating system upgrades past Android 6.01. If I were to replace the phone today and amortize the cost over 3.5 years of use, it would come out to about $271 per year of ownership. If my wife's new Honor 7x lasts 2 years and we chuck it in the lake, walk away and buy a new phone, it will amortize to $90 per year of ownership. Another way to look at this is: I'd have to nurse my Note 4 along for over 10 years before the numbers pan out like the Honor 7x - all while enjoying a dated OS and no further factory support from the 2nd year on.

Meanwhile, cell phone CPU's, memory, camera's and screens all improve over time and new OS's make the phones more user friendly than the older ""flagships"" we try to cling to. Well, no more for me. I've seen the light and once I replace my Note 4 I'll cap the replacement at $250 or less with full confidence I'll lose nothing by comparison. As for my new attitude, I say torpedo the flagships and send them to the bottom of the sea. They've gouged me long enough."
B078NCL7GK,blueamcat,5,"So I finally upgraded my phone from an Apple iPhone 6 back in July. Man was it NICE to get off that ship. xD I was a little worried about getting a larger phone as I have small hands and women's jeans don't have pockets. LOL
However, it only took a week or so to really get used to it. I carry it either in my back pocket or in a bag/jacket.

The camera looks great as long as you have light, like most cameras. It's definitely an upgrade from what I was using. Has some neat features that are added with the second lens.

The fingerprint sensor is a dream. It's in just the right spot and works great as long as it's clean and your fingers are dry. The one on my iPhone didn't work so not having to type in my password every time I need my phone is extra nice!

Headphone jack is still nice! I use it every so often. Good for planes and road trips.

Battery life is wonderful. Lasts a good 18+ hours with pretty normal to heavy use. I usually can make it last a full day though. I do a lot of social media stuff so I use the camera and post things quite a bit.

The phone runs smooth and I haven't seen any issues with the current OS 8.0.

Definitely worth the price!!"
B078NCL7GK,kim lauer,2,"I had this phone for only seven months and used to love it! The battery life was awesome and most of the functions worked as well as the more pricey phones. I bought 2 of these in June and they both started to malfunction. The one did not charge at all anymore, and sadly this phone has no built in wireless charging capabilities. I sent it to the manufacturer since it was still under warranty. They immediately sent it back stating there was liquid damage and they would not cover it. I really don't think they had it long enough to even look at it as it came back to me within the week. I feel they just don't want to stand by their warranty. The second phone was just shipped to them yesterday, as that one is having a battery problem as well and wont charge anymore. I would stay away from Honor phones and maybe steer clear of Huawei products as well, I feel they will just use an excuse to not repair your phone. The batteries should last a lot longer than 7 months."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I hate being tied into phone contracts so I always prefer to buy a decent cheap phone outright and use it until it dies. I went from an $80 LG G2 mini, which finally broke from too many floor drops during a house move, to this phone. All good so far, a bit too much bloatware I can't easily remove for my liking. I do appreciate that it came with a clear protective case included. It is not too heavy, screen size is great, easy to use. My one major complaint is the battery. I have yet to see 100% charge because it takes forever and I always need to use it eventually which eats away at the battery power so fast. I already have all kinds of power saving features enabled but they do nothing for how long it takes to charge. I am concerned about how it will do in a situation where it may not be possible to charge it often."
B078NCL7GK,mama,3,"Man this was a great phone for like 2 days. But we're still sticking with this brand. We bought this brand new from Amazon. Not used to make sure it would be good. After connecting it to Bluetooth it had these lines appear and they just kept getting worse despite don't everything Honor customer care said. Company (phone maker) wanted us to send the phone to them so they could repair it but we're exchanging through Amazon first since we need a phone still. Maybe this one was just bad. Only a few other people online had the same problem. We own the 5, 6, and now the 7 in these phones so they are great. Hold up well. Great pictures and video. Hearing someone who's talking on speaker on their phone is hard to hear on these phones but it's ok. I hope the replacements works and I'll update this review cause I really enjoy these phones. Only 3 star cause phone was amazing until the lines. And both companies are working to fix the issue. So don't Chuck your old phone until you've made sure you won't need an emergency back up for whatever reason."
B078NCL7GK,J&R,5,"This phone is a great value for money. It has proven to very stable, smooth to operate and has great battery time. The camera is reasonable for the price and every other feature I need in a phone meets or exceeds my expectation. The phone feels and functions like a premium phone. I used this for while, gave it out as present to get the Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked, that has slightly higher ram and more memory. They exactly work and feel the same. I would be happy with either phone, except the increased 64Bit storage that helps with keeping more local files on phone."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I searched high and low for an Android operating phone that could do as much as this phone can do under $200, and let me tell you... THERE ARE NONE! This is the best phone I have ever owned, comes with a case which is awesome because I'm still waiting for the one I ordered to come in. I have had this phone for two weeks now and I absolutely love it! I was a little concerned because of some of the one star reviews, but I have not experienced and software issues, and have even dropped it on a hard floor once and it did not crack. The case it comes with isn't amazing, but it certainly offers a light to moderate amount of protection against drops. If anyone else finds a great screen protector for this phone please comment below!"
B078NCL7GK,Brandon,5,"Phones have gotten to be so expensive and they are outdated so fast. I have had Samsung Note 3,4, and 5. I decided to try something different cheaper. This phone 7x is great the battery life is amazing going on my second day of heavy useand it's still got life left. For the price you can not beat it the screen looks amazing!

Pros:
Super long battery life
Touch ID is extremely fast with responding
Camera is very good and has a ton of features and in pro mode you can even take long exsposer pictures.
Phone all so comes with a clear case that is actually cool.

Cons:
Speaker is just OK
No Wireless Charging
No NFC
The screen is not as responsive as some of the higher dollar phones."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"My husband bought this phone for me thinking it would be faster than my last phone. Not only is it slow, but I continually have problems with receiving text messages especially group texts. They just hang up there forever until I go into my settings and put my phone on airplane mode and off for every message that is hung up. This is quite annoying and I hate it. Never had this problem on any other phone I owned. I wonder if it is too late to return it and ask for a refund? It also takes a long time to download long documents and send them. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, have issues with the camera getting hung up and takes awhile to get it set up to take picture, slow, slow, slow."
B078NCL7GK,Home shopping savant.,4,"Waiting on support. Fingerprint sensor doesn't seem to work. More after i resolve that. Other than that this seems like a solid smart phone at a reasonable price. OK.. THE INSTRUCTIONS are wrong on the fingerprint sensor.. no ""vibrate"" . you smoosh your finger around the sensor until the little ""icon"" is filled then a message to touch your finger on the edge pops up.. so the sensor worked.. the set up is written wrong. Amazon support doesn't know this and Huawei has iffy support for Honor Phones as far as I can tell. The phone is great.. Machined aluminum case and gorilla glass.. tough..minimum bloatwear.. good size.. not too big like a ""phablet"" fits into a hand nce.. fits into pockets. great display. better than the ASUS this replaces.. The ASUS was OK.. too many annoying bugs (camera was slow.. like ketchup that won't come out of a bottle. I think this will be a very good phone, purchased on PRIME day at a very competitive price."
B078NCL7GK,MS YAN WU,5,"They said it will release on Jan 25 when i pre-order it in Dec last year, but I got it Jan 24. this is the best smart phone I have ever had. for the price and quality, it is nothing to compain about.
Some useful info.:
1. this phone came with a clear rubber case, so if you are not really care about the personality, the case is quite good.
2, there is curve on either side, so if you buy the screen protector, it may not easy to install.
3. it only support NANO sim card, NOT the micro sim card, so i need to change to a new card.
4. use the small pin provided to push out the side slot for SIM and microSD card.
5. support Daul sim card"
B078NCL7GK,Steve Brown,5,"This is a great phone.

Bought this for my wife to replace her lenovo Moto g4. The screen is amazing. It feel like a premium phone for a very low price. The only issues I've noticed:

the bezel makes the on screen home buttons very close to any case you put on it, making it difficult to hit them without a touch of practice, but very minor.

There can be a slight delay for the same reason above when typing on the keyboard.

Other than that, battery is great, lasts all day. Screen is very nice. Sound is very good. I have a Sony xa1 ultra as well, and the screen size is very comparable, but the honor 7x is much more comfortable to hold, not bulky at all.

If you want a premium handset without a $1000 pricetag, you won't be disappointed."
B078NCL7GK,Cassie,5,"Love the phone but a lot of times it doesn't pick up my touch. I have the 6x and it recognizes my touch just fine. So it's very frustrating when I'm typing and it skips letters due to it not picking up the touch and also with the main screen buttons. I don't know if I have a faulty device or of this is a common issue. other than that it's a good phone.

Update.
Have removed the screen protector and so far it's doing good. Will update again if I have any problems."
B078NCL7GK,Lazaro,5,"This is an awesome phone!!! The price is amazingly low for a high quality device. Performance is great and very fast. Connection to LTE is great as well too. And the screen looks very good. I don't game so i couldn't tell you how it does, but browsing, watching videos, and normal phone functions work flawlessly. This is the best phone in its category for the price by far."
B078NCL7GK,Big Reader,5,"I love this phone. It is big enough, has fantastic features, takes great pictures, and great connection to my service 4LTE. I personally think paying $1000 for a phone is not cost effective when you can get something that does pretty much the same thing. It had face recognition before many of the""great"" companies and it works great. The fingerprint recognition is also very good but takes some time to set up and memorize your fingerprint, but, nonetheless, I did fingers on both hands. Updated to Oreo right away and it just works great. I will say I am not a ""power"" user, I text and make calls, use the net once in a while.........so the power for me is great lasts 3 days. All the apps open quickly and run well. No big glitches. SO if you was an almost 6 inch phone, that is fast, takes pretty pictures, great sound, smooth and easy screen, and has decent battery power, this may be for you. I think it is great! Reviews on this phone rate it the best for what you get."
B078NCL7GK,sk,5,"I love this phone!I waited a few months before reviewing and have yet to have any issues. I wish more people knew about it. The camera is amazing,the phone is easy to use and setup, plenty of space with great options to add more, battery life is pretty great and fast to charge, speakers are plenty good. I live in the Midwest in the middle of no where with TMobile and I haven't had any issues not even a moment of slowness."
B078NCL7GK,some other guy,5,"This is my first android. I've had an iphone since they came out and I'm coming from a 5C to this 7x. I've had it for about 24 hours now and wow! For 200 bucks you couldn't get a better phone. The screen is huge and beautiful. This definitely isn't a 1 handed phone. I'm not a big gamer at all just some pokemon go. Android took some getting used to at first but I love this phone. My only gripe is the very very limited selection in cases (it does come with a flimsy clear one) but that's the price you pay for a cheap phone. Really though, nothing about this phone seems cheap. I threw on the IQ matte shield for the screen and if you can get phones like this for 200 bucks why would you ever pay 500+ again?"
B078NCL7GK,Yessi2011,4,It's a good phone! It doesn't feel cheap it's not really lightweight. I got the blue colored phone.. On the photo it looks lighter blue but it's not its darker in person. The screen is crisp and vibrant. The photos are too. But the videos are crisp not really clear and the audio isn't clear. That's why I gave it a 4 star the audio in videos aren't the best quality. Other than that I haven't had any lags or issues with the phone. Loving it =)
B078NCL7GK,Joanne,3,"UPDATE (3/13/18) - After reluctantly returning to my iPhone 6s, I found the Huawei Mate SE. It has snappy performance and is a better fit for me. My iPhone has been officially retired.

UPDATE (2/23/18) - Like this phone in so many ways but the laggy performance has convinced me to return it and keep looking.

I've used some version of the iPhone for the past 10 years and never thought I'd switch, but the pricing of flagship models has become ridiculous. After reading several reviews of the Honor 7X, I took the plunge and am so happy I did. I'm definitely not an Android expert nor a power user, but the learning curve has been relatively painless and now that I've got everything set up, I couldn't be happier with my choice. The phone is well built and performs great in every way for my needs. I feel really good about choosing this brand and model... for me, it's perfect."
B078NCL7GK,Dennis Mcgrath,5,"For the price, this phone is an excellent performer. Seems really fast, the screen is crystal clear, with very nice colors. The battery life is excellent. It only loses 2% on standby over the span of 11 hours at night. sound quality is good, pictures taken with the camera look very good. Comes with a TPU clear cover which is ok. I replaced a Moto G5Plus with this and this phone in my opinion is a better phone."
B078NCL7GK,M,4,"I wanted to wait a while before reviewing this item as its meant to be a long term purchase and i wanted to see how it held up. I'm not the most tech savvy person so this isnt the most professional or technical review for this product.

I love this phone! I had the 6 for quite a while but dropped it into water at a theme park. The 7 was the same price at the time so i figured why not get the newer phone. I am very happy with the quality of this phone and the price. it runs most games very well and handles calls just fine.

Unfortunately, i have to agree with other reviewers that the edges of the touch screen have sensitivity issues. For some reason especially where the ""P"" is located on the keyboard while texting. the problem persists with games. i really have to smash that part of the phone to get it to respond. I've gotten used to it strangely, but its definitely still a problem and anyone buying this item should be aware of it.

If your looking for a low cost alternative to big brand cell phones and your not looking to do anything too fancy with it i think this phone would work great for you so long as your open to getting used to the sensitivity issue with the touch screen. I didnt have that problem with the 6 though, so that is another option."
B078NCL7GK,elarrecostao,5,"has OTG capability and excellent viewing angles.
it is kept updated with the latest security patch, never happened with my moto g5+.
seems emui is not very patient with third party launchers, won't allow the twin app feature with any of them. i'm using Holo because it meets my needs but fluidity is somewhat lessened.

update 12/31: dropped holo and installed nova for 99Â¢ on sale and it is running flawlessly.
Jan 12: doesn't feature fast charging but it does charge fast."
B078NCL7GK,Speedy,5,"Hereâs what I like about this phone:
1) Fingerprint reader - Awesome! It unlocks the phone instantly. Love this feature.
2) The metal casing and heft of the phone feel great on the hand.
3) The 16:9 screen is vibrant and pleasant to the eye.
4) The 16 MP camera - Takes great pictures ( see picture taken with phone)
5) Excellent battery life - Iâve been using it to watch videos, Pandora, taking photos, texting and the battery lasts for more than 1 day.

Here are features I wish it had:
1) Fast charging - Although not a deal breaker but nice to have.
2) OLED screen - Perhaps is too much to ask but it would be a nice feature.

At this price point, the phone is a great value for the features it has. I would definitely recommend this phone."
B078NCL7GK,kojo Archie,4,"Just got it today, play with it a little bit,I think it is amazing phone"
B078NCL7GK,Christian,5,"I've been using this phone from Toronto for about a month and a half now and it has been performing perfectly. It does work with any Canadian carrier on 4G LTE, I am with virgin mobile and it works with 4G LTE. Comes with a clear tpu case, a charger, the phone and a sim tray tool. This is a MAJOR upgrade from my previous phone (Moto G). Camera quality is Excellent in good lighting. Portrait mode isn't that good but it gets the job done. Battery life is good for a whole day and that's coming from a heavy user. finger print sensor is insanely fast. I recommend buying a good case as it is a bit slippery. Call quality is great. Oh and turn off the option where it picks up calls once u raise it to your ear because if you leave it on , it will randomly pick up when in your pocket

Over all amazing, this phone competes with flagship phones for sure"
B078NCL7GK,McHellen M Nyaoso,5,"I got my phone a day ago, am so in love with it my kids are giving me the wierd lookð"
B078NCL7GK,John C.,5,"Technology is getting to the point where having a high-quality phone no longer requires purchasing a $800+ device. Honor device is a perfect example of that. Not only is the phone made very well, but it has handled everything that my wife has thrown out at it, to include playing multiple games, social media, texting, Etc. Francis, he device at this price point will not have everything that the recently released Galaxy (insert model here) phone has, but if you really think about it...How often do you use every feature on the more high price phones? Seriously, I highly recommend this phone, especially if you're looking for a budget-friendly quality device."
B078NCL7GK,Sarah H,4,"Not the best but not the worst. definitely good for the money. The camera is less than advertised so that was kinda disappointing. Don't even bother trying to take a low lighting photo. Good outdoor photos though.
The battery is okay. It lasts all day, but if I use it for browsing and such nonstop it eats about 10 to 20% in an hour.
Haven't tried watching videos on it.
The led notification light it worthless, which was also disappointing.
Had there been better reviews at the time I probably would have gone with something else.
The screen quality is good though, it is nice and bright."
B078NCL7GK,Pamela Meyer-Middleton,5,"I would give it more stars if I could. I am not a phone expert. I use Tracfone and have purchased unlocked smart phones from Amazon. This phone is awesome. The camera (which was one of my primary concerns) is also awesome for my purposes. It was super easy to unlock and transfer all my remaining minutes/texts/data through Tracfone. I paid $199.00 for it using the six months interest free with my Amazon card. I never thought I'd pay that much for a phone....but, it's so much more than a phone. If I could manage Quicken on it, I'd get rid of my crappy laptop."
B078NCL7GK,shane,4,"For $200, you get a lot of power. The phone is fast, has great battery life (I usually get around 2 days from one charge). Phone is unlocked out of the box so you can use it on a variety of GSM carriers (I use Cricket).

I've only had it for a few months but so far I am very impressed with this thing. I've had other budget phones where it just dies a horrible death within months (I upgraded from the BLU RD1 HD, which lasted me only 8 months before it became unusable). If you are looking for a great performer on a budget, this is a great choice.

The only things that I would gripe about (and they are really minor issues for me) are...

1. Setting wallpapers is weird. The image you pick will get LARGE, so if want a picture of your family, a kid, a pet, etc....a lot of times it will get cut off on the screen due to the warped size. Not a huge deal if you just have a generic graphic that you use.

2. Fitbits WILL NOT WORK with this phone. They are not a formally supported device. My wife has an Honor 6X and has the same issue with hers. Definitely a deal breaker if you rely on a FitBit for fitness tracking.

3. Some apps will not appear as notifications on the lock screen, but will appear in the taskbar when you unlock the phone.

The fitbit issue will be a dealbreaker for some folks but if you just want a phone that works fast, well, and doesn't break the bank....definitely give this phone a shot."
B078NCL7GK,Rodrigo Miranda,5,"In October 2018, the price can't be better for a Android Oreo. The phone is fast - much faster than my Blackberry Keyone that costed a fortune.
Everything works great. This device is amazing. Great screen.
I miss USB-C charging and fast charging. Other than that, everything is great."
B078NCL7GK,Heather Hutton,5,"I have waited two weeks before submitting a review, so I could give my honest impressions. I have been extremely impressed with the Huawei Honor 7x. I'm just thankful I had done so much research on different phones in my price range. It is by far the best smartphone I have ever had. I have had LG and Samsungs in the past and they were good phones but I feel like the Honor 7x wins hands down. I protected my screen with Mr. Shield anti glare screen protector and I'm good to go now. Thank you Huawei!!!"
B078NCL7GK,TJ,3,"I was getting this as a second phone and so I could have an android phone again as a side kick to my iPhone. I am in IT and like having both worlds for my job. The price is perfect and I really wanted to keep it! However I had a few issues with it so I sent it back. There was an issue with the olaphobic coating in the top right corner while made smudges that never went away! I also had other issues with the screen, colors, turning off when it wasnât supposed too, etc. I am hoping this was a fluke issue with my device but one I couldnât deal with!"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I'll be short and sweet on this. The device is neither thin nor thick, and its weight is more than fine for someone like me whose wrists and hands can support more than a pound of weight for more than five minutes. For its price the build quality is commendable, and my only gripe is the choice to make the rear dual cameras have their own assemblies rather than being under one piece of raised metal and glass. Dirt and dust gets caught in-between the cameras frequently enough to cause some frustration.

The screen is in some ways better than I expected, with only slight color shifting at odd and infrequent angles. Camera is very good and i've taken some very pleasant pictures with it, and I've only slight dissatisfaction with the kirin processor in here. The single bottom-firing speaker is... alright, i suppose. You really should use headphones with this phone if you like listening to music. Also, the bluetooth reception can be quite shoddy since it doesn't have its own dedicated band, and I've encountered several issues with perfectly fine bluetooth headsets while using this phone.

Overall, not the best phone in its class, but it's hard to with how good budget phones are becoming. I'm happy enough with it to still be using it and still want to use it for a while yet."
B078NCL7GK,Ria,5,"Everyone thinks it's an iPhone when i have the case off. It's truly a beautiful phone with premium like quality. It takes amazing pictures which is what I use it for the most. One thing that'll take a while to get used to is the navigation panel being backwards for me. I'm used to the back buttons being on the right, but it won't be a problem after a few months of using the phone. Just wished they offered an option to switch the navigation around like in the new version of this phone."
B078NCL7GK,Arctic_Kats,5,"Great phone for the price! It's super quick, I can use multiple apps at once and there isn't any bloatware on this phone. One annoying thing is that it keeps telling me when an app is using a lot of energy (like Pokemon Go), but I got this phone for playing games on. The pictures it takes are breathtaking and I love the dual camera because I can focus on the foreground or background for taking professional looking pics. I had a Blu Vivo XL2 that lasted 1 year before it broke, so I hope Honor 7X can outlive my last phone."
B078NCL7GK,Alexander,5,"Penny pinching AT&T prepaid customer here. Purchased a very cheap phone from AT&T recently and determined within a week that the poor choice of buying a 60 dollar not-so-smart phone would have to be remedied. I did some research and narrowed it down to the honor 7x for a number of reasons. 200 dollars is not the easiest thing I've parted with but it wasn't until I had the phone in my hand that the quality put the praise worthy price point into perspective. The ability to trim down and disable alot of the manufacturer pre-loaded apps, dual SIM card capability, definition and clarity of both the display and the camera(s) are astonishing. The battery life is incredible compared to my last phone. I received the phone with 40-50 percent battery life. Discharging the battery via constant video streaming took around 4 and a half hours. The metal housing feels tremendously sturdy and the phone has a weight and presence in your hand that is comfortable. Last but certainly not least, download and upload speeds are ludicrous. I mean, this phone is FAST. 5/5 stars from me. Will absolutely purchase again."
B078NCL7GK,Rick,5,"For $200 there is no better phone out there! Everything about this phone is outstanding, except for the sound. Speakers could be a little better but that's the only drawback. If the speakers are a deal breaker, look elsewhere. If your just looking for a not only great budge phone, but legitimately good phone period, this is for you! It even came with it's own phone case and it's actually really nice.
UODATE: this phone really gives you the Galaxy S8/S9 feel for a quarter of the price."
B078NCL7GK,tenderfoot,5,"I love the looks and the speed. It has slots for 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 microSD. I chose the SD thinking that I could load many of my apps on the SD, freeing up RAM memory, but no such luck. On the other hand, I can load all of my photos, music and data on the 32 GB SD without slowing down the OS. The camera is awesome compared to my old Samsung and the screen is bright and sharp, though it flickers a bit sometimes....and it has spontaneously rebooted a couple of times like I believe most phones do. Importantly, online support has been great. All-in-all, despite the flaws noted, I LOVE IT and don't think you can match it anywhere for the price."
B078NCL7GK,Tate House,5,"This phone is amazing, having been a iOS user for the last few years I came to like the hardware but I wanted the Android operating system. This phone is the best of both worlds, feels exactly like my iPhone. You're getting flagship quality for a fraction of the price, phone is very fast and has an excellent battery. I use mine quite frequently throughout the day and my phone will only be around 50 percent when I charge it before I go to bed. Camera quality can't compete with the top of the line phones but it takes better photos than my old iPhone 6 and I can't complain one bit. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good phone on a budget!"
B078NCL7GK,Shaun,5,"I bought this for my gf and she's extremely happy with it,

great battery life!
great camera!
great build quality!!
extremely fast finger print scanner!
its also good for gaming (played pubg for a few hours on it and had no issues )"
B078NCL7GK,JOE HOUTS,1,Not happy at all. Received first phone...won't send SMS or MMS messages . called company and tech said it's defective and to call Amazon for a replacement. Got replacement phone...... exact same issues can't text. Two phones defective? Doubt it. There is a hardware/software problem with this phone. Maker couldn't figure it out. My cell provider tech couldn't figure it out either. I use it for work and it's been a week and it's affected my business
B078NCL7GK,Paula Mendez,5,"6 months ago I switched from my Galaxy S7 (which completely shattered within 6 months) To this phone, I saw many people recommending this as a budget phone, I liked the price and no longer see a reason to get a flagship device when all I really do is browse the web, shop online, send messages, light gaming, and use social media, these newer budget phones can handle all that with ease, and this phone really surprised me, all the features built in to this $200 make it feel very premium, it's very fast and responsive, I'd say better than My S7 for a fraction of the price. Flagship devices are really an unnecessary luxury now, as there isn't a need for them as there used to be, this phone really proves that"
B078NCL7GK,Samuel Montilla,5,"I upgraded my Honor 6X to this new one and im very happy with it, the camera is excellent, the speed is good (it does not stutter at all) screen is huge but some apps are not compatible with this size of screen so you will see a blank space on the bottom..

It feels good on the hand even better than the honor 6x.. I have 0 issues with it and when i got it i installed the clone app (by huawei) and in 10 minutes my new phone was ready to use with all the apps and they configuration i have previously on my honor 6x that was super nice.."
B078NCL7GK,Canned_Heatit,5,"Nice phone for this level of price. The set up is very easy and the screen is so big. I love it. I had a T-Mobile SIM card and everything is working fine. Perhaps the camera can be improved but again, it is a 200 use phone, so it is fine for me.
I recommend this phone to whoever does not want to spend 1000 use for an I phone or Samsung"
B078NCL7GK,KOK,5,"Great phone. The look is awesome. Photos/ videos are crispy, Cristal clear, and unrivaled. It is very light phone. The battery life is wonderful. You can go almost 2 days without charging."
B078NCL7GK,Niko C,5,"My last 200$ phone was an absolute piece of trash that couldn't keep more than 1 app in the background at a time and was made of plastic. This was a far different story though. Honors(Huaweis) EMUI software is snappy if a bit heavy on killing background apps. On the other hand, if you have another 30$, I would recommend getting the Mate SE becuase that phone at 230 with 4gb of ram and 64gb of storage is an even greater value."
B078NCL7GK,Superamazon,1,"Update: This went from 5 star phone to a 0 star phone for me within the 8 months of owning it. This phone will eventually slow down and stop working. I finally called it quits with this phone when (just now) it factory reset my phone because I inputted my password incorrectly (even though I logged in a couple of times before). It gives you 9 tries to enter it correctly which I did do but then through the day I entered it incorrectly. It should have reset the 9 tries after I entered it correctly but it didn't! Now I lost all my pictures, contacts, etc. I hate HUEWEI!! I'm sticking to Samsung (for android) or Apple phones from now on!! Beware anyone who is tempted by the price. It isn't worth it in the long-run. You've been warned.
_______________________________________________________________
I am soooo impressed with this smartphone. My previous phone (Nexus 5X) bricked on me after a firmware update and I was need of a phone fast!

So I went out looking for the best bang for the bucks but I didn't want to spend more then $250.. I came to the conclusion that whatever phone I buy at that price range will be a used or refurbished one. A little bit of research had me looking into this bad boy and I was truly amazed at the price point. However, I was worried that being a Chinese brand, the quality would suffer (sorry, this myth no longer holds true to me after purchasing this phone and a TCL smart TV).

The final step of deciding to purchase this phone came in comparing what I can get instead for the same price range... Nothing came close after hours of research except the Samsung Galaxy S7.. the difference would be that the Galaxy S7 would cost way more for a brand new phone and a refurbished in most cases would also cost more!!
Verdict after 2 Weeks with the phone: Truly amazing and I'm not exaggerating. I am actually constantly looking at the phone amazed that I got it at this price. It feels like I'm easily holding a phone that retails upwards of $400 but I got it for half that. If anyone else is on the fence like I was.. jump right over! the grass really is greener on the Honor 7X side ( ="
B078NCL7GK,Vincent Nicastro,3,"I have been using the iPhone since the beginning. I have never owned an Android device so I canât compare it to others. I even have the iPhone X. The reason I purchased this was I wanted a phone with dual sims. I hate carrying around two devices. I did a lot of research and wanted a good value. This phone fit the bill.
It will work with any gsm network. T-Mobile, AT&T and other prepaid gsm providers in the US.
Pros-
Fingerprint sensor is lighting fast!
Camera is pretty good.
Screen looks great
The phone is pretty snappy as far as speed. No real lag. I am using the stock software and from what I have read installing different launchers can slow it down.

Cons-
No 5ghz WiFi.
No fast charge, it takes a long time to fully charge.
No wifi calling
Second sim only 2G, you can still text but I donât know if it can handle picture messages on 2G
No native mail app. You must use a third party mail app. Yahoo, google.
I think it has some form of ad software installed.
The usb connection to most new car radios does not allow you to play music or streaming apps from the phone. That can only be done with Bluetooth. This might just be an Android thing and not a phone thing. My iPhones have always worked with the usb connection.

Android messages.. this is by far the worst feature of an Android phone. There is no comparison to iMessage on the iPhone. It has limited features and a character limit.. seriously? Its 2018 and text are limited to 160 characters ð. If you are a heavy texter which I am not, Android isnât for you if you are coming from an iPhone.
I guess some of my review is about the Android 7 OS. ð
I feel like I am using Windoze again. Itâs not too bad but If you are tech savvy you can figure it out.
Iâll keep using it for a couple of weeks and if my opinion changes Iâll update my review.

If you are looking for a good value then this is the phone for you. For $200, you canât go wrong.

UPDATE..

Well, I spoke to soon.. I am returning the phone.
It is now locking up. I have to constantly reboot it, I have had to reset it and when I install a few apps it starts happening again. I am guessing itâs the Android OS that is the problem but.. if the OS wonât run correctly it doesnât matter how good the hardware is.
I am not a gamer or a frequent texter.. I do use a few social media apps and shopping apps, thatâs about it..
still a good value if you can deal with the android OS."
B078NCL7GK,CLC,5,"I have had this phone for a month and, knock on wood, it's doing great. I like the glass as it's smooth and easy to clean and doesn't cloud up like plastic. Easy to connect to car through blue tooth for hands free driving. Loud and clear sound. Runs movies pretty well also. Charge lasts about 4 days. Make sure you let the charge get down to 15%, when it shows red, before recharging to extend the battery life."
B078NCL7GK,Nathan,4,"This phone is now my daily phone and it definitely is a nice phone. I also purchased a case and screen protector for it and with those I've dropped it several times with no damage at all. This phone is not for those who don't like bigger phones as it is quite large, however it has no problem fitting in my pocket. I have noticed that the ram is a little touchy so you will have to boost it from time to time and not leave open certain apps. This phone charges pretty quick and the battery lasts me all day. the camera quality is nothing amazing however if you are just using it for social media it is fine. The screen looks great and and games look nice. Overall it's a pretty solid phone for the price."
B078NCL7GK,Phoebe Saffold,5,"We bought 2 of these and took them to the T-Mobile store, where a very nice woman activated them and transferred all our apps and data for us. It was important for my husband to have a magnetometer, which this phone does. The battery (after 4 days) seems to last a long time. Will get back to you if we have any changes, but so far we are very happy we bought these. Our previous (unlocked) phones were Amazon special deals, and they had so much bloatware that the phones became almost impossible to use. It was important to us to find an unlocked phone with little bloatware and a lot of storage space."
B078NCL7GK,rebecca,5,"First time buying unlocked phone so I was super nervous. Shipped fast; OEM packaging as far as I can tell. Sleek phone; great performance so far. Camera is fun to use; not so great in low light so use flash. Still; portrait mode is gorgeous on both cameras. Haven't had a hiccup upgrading to Android 8 and works great with metro/TMobile service.
TLDR: fancy on a budget; works great"
B078NCL7GK,K. Miller,5,Had it about 2 months when it slipped out of my pouch and plopped into the slippery rock river. I slid down the bank after it and bunged my shoulder. It then took me 10 minutes to find it fish it out. It had self-powered down but showed no obvious signs of water penetration. I buried it in a bag of rice for a night and plugged it in the next morning and it fired right up. This is a grand phone for the money. I have never owned any flagships but my wife has always owned a newer iphone. I like this one better in overall design irregardless of the price. Upgrade to Oreo happened the day I received it.
B078NCL7GK,True Lor,4,"Well, it works like what others have said about this phone but my phone kept getting the screen turn off, although, I already set it to 10min. I will only give it 4 stars until I or someone help me solved this issue.

(Update)
Okay, I seem to solve my own problem now with the lock screen time being short. When I do the transfer of data from my google account to my new phone, the backup data was carrying my old phone system into the new phone. In which, the old system info have conflict with the new phone system. After I do a factory reset and not do the transfer of data into the phone it actually solve the problem."
B078NCL7GK,martys40s,1,To start with I purchased this phone on Prim Day and after I found out that I had paid more then if I had ordered it an any regular day. Then I found out the company does not offer an extended warranty. Customer service rep was very abrupt and did not offer much help. Quality of the phones functions were average. the thing that turned me off the most was that the screen was very fragile and broke very easy. Cost was prohibitive to have repaired. Cost me $200 for 5 months use. Purchase a phone from one of the more famous companies.
B078NCL7GK,USA PACKING,5,"I just change from iPhone to android, learning curve is not that big actually. Data transfer take sometime, but worth it. Phone is fast and smooth, battery is pretty good, normal use surely last for a full day.
Price is great for the this phone can do. highly recommend"
B078NCL7GK,Chocoleeza,5,"Great phone for the price - got it for my 12 yo as a gift. As a young techie, he can't keep his hands off it (which says a lot about the design and features, especially in comparison that the previous phones that he had and their lack of features that he used to ""hint"" to us about ). It keeps the charge well. We already have experience with the phone so it says something when we decide to buy another one - now his is an upgrade over ours!"
B078NCL7GK,mastika,1,"The phone looks nice and very cheap. But the GPS never work and you will be lost if you are in a busy city driving. The GPS will notify you where to turn left or right after you have missed the route. Sometimes, the GPS does not know where you are, sometimes it does not even start at all. Honestly, the calls are very slow and so many issues with it. I recommend better to get a different phone with higher price."
B078NCL7GK,Ail,1,I always but a case and a screen protector instantly for my new phones. The one time I dropped this phone it stopped working properly. The first to go was the side buttons which was the most frustrating. Try having no way of lowering the volume and constantly having to do it manually instead of being able to use the buttons. Apps would always keep shutting down or not functioning properly on this phone. The only good thing about this phone is how well the screen is made.
B078NCL7GK,Richard Colvin,5,"Some of the software isn't made for the USA
Voice typing quit working by itself one day, even a factory reset didn't fix this problem.
Support fixed it for free, even paid for postage both ways."
B078NCL7GK,Jeffery King,5,Love this phone. It is so easy to use and I out the battery to the test the first day I got it using mid level battery saver that already built into the phone. In doing so the battery lasted 36 straight hours at 100% before it died. Way better then my old s6 active that I had. Now you will need a case with this phone because it so slim and light weight. I haven't personally tested the phone durability due to not wanting to break it. But over all an amazing phone for 200 bucks and it easy to clone your old Android phone data over to this phone
B078NCL7GK,Eric Gray,4,I have always been an iPhone junkie. I would never get anything that wasnât apple. I recently have been in the process of switching phone companies (because sprint sucks lol) and I didnât wanna get a new iPhone yet because Apple will release the new ones in November so I bought this phone on prime day to use because it was cheap and I can honestly say that I LOVE it and Iâm not sure that I will get a new iPhone when they come out. The only thing I wish was better is the camera.
B078NCL7GK,Kaelyn,5,"Great smooth fast phone. Camera works like a dream and has a lot of cool features to it. Only problem is that I can't find a way to have the notification details pop up on the lock screen it always says ""content hidden"" and nothing in the settings help"
B078NCL7GK,Mark C,5,"This phone is replacing a iPhone 6 and I am astounded at how good this 200$ phone is. The screen display is vivid and the size is perfect for youtube, calls/texting is easy and reliable, camera is quick and responsive, and the fingerprint sensor is faster than my girlfriend's Galaxy s8! This exceeded my expectations for a phone and I don't think I can ever go back to paying more than 500 bucks for a phone. Definitely recommend!"
B078NCL7GK,LaBealeIsoud,5,"Excellent value for the price. The phone screen and back are not great materials, but work just fine. Battery life is excellent. Many features are better than what is available for pricier phones: ability to get FM radio and dual sim in particular. Although it took a little doing, I was able to activate my phone at the AT&T store with no problems. I also used a Tracfone ATT sim without issues. I believe that this phone will also work on T-Mobile networks, although I have not tested this. The camera app is not quite as good as my Nexus 5x, but is fine for my needs."
B078NCL7GK,SnowPigs,4,"I am pretty happy with the quality of the phone. Though if I compare it to my old Note 4, the Note (a phone from 2012) might winout in quality of device. Overall though I'm very happy. One thing this phone beats my old Note 4 on is battery. This thing has a killer battery, ending a day of moderate use at around 70% most of the time."
B078NCL7GK,Derb,5,"Combines a bunch of the newest features in the market and functions wonderfully. Works with Straight talk BYOP,"
B078NCL7GK,clive rennie,5,"wow where should i start sure my galaxy not 8 is a beast, but this phone is sexy and beautiful. I wanted the blue one sold out twice im still gonna buy it from Huwaei if i have to they offer a swag bag deal tripod special case, so ill wait n see if Amazon gets the blue one back. Screen size is awesome speed is fast dual sim use one for a 256 gig sd card from samsung overall this is the best deal i hope Amazon gets the red valentines day edition when it comes out. great buy go out and buy this phone oreo 8.0 is out real soon so great deal.This is an update the screen lags a bit when scrolling up or down in apps hope this is fixed soon."
B078NCL7GK,Preston,5,"It was coming close to the time I usually start thinking about s new phone because the old one bored me/started having issues. The 7x brings that trend to and end. I love this phone and will use it till it dies.

Overall it's amazing. I can go all day on my phone with moderately high usage. (Mostly texting and Mobil gaming) I have left this phone cased most of the time and always screen protected. No scratches or blemishes on the phone. And best of all it doesn't feel like my phone's battery dies off a little more each day.

My only cons for this phone really is the picture quality. It's eh.. but acceptable. And I wish it had a type c charger.

Screen clarity isnt amazing but it's good for those who are screen snobs.

I love it. You should buy it. And splurg for the 4gb ram phone if you have the extra doe."
B078NCL7GK,Jean,2,"I'm returning it as soon as my replacement phone gets here. I'm sending it back for the following reasons:
1. The keyboard is annoying. It's a small gripe that I'd be willing to overlook if the phone were otherwise okay.
2. The camera is lackluster. I use my dedicated camera for ""real"" pictures, but this thing really does stink in less than ideal conditions. I use the phone camera to snap quick pictures I can send to family, but I'd rather use my actual camera and go through the hassle of uploading them to my computer and emailing them than to text dark, blurry pictures instantaneously.
3. The phone lags. I wondered what people meant when they said this and thought they were being fussy. After all, it's pretty remarkable to be using a hand-held computer at all. But it does, and it's annoying. I think that my keystrokes haven't registered and all of a sudden, I'm texting like a ham-fingered drunkard.
4. This is main reason. The call quality sucks. The people I'm on the line with come through crystal clear. I come through crystal clear to them, except when I don't. On several occasions on multiple calls, if I literally (and I mean ""literally"" literally, not figuratively) turned my body 45 degrees, my reception was dropped entirely. I could hear the person on the other line, but they couldn't hear me.
I mentioned this to a relative who is a huge tech guy and he had the same problems, but somehow lasted a month before ditching his.
He has a Moto E4 and loves it, but being a tech guy, is already planning on upgrading to a newer version. His girlfriend has had an E4 for over a year and loves it. I ordered an E4 Plus, just for the extra MP on the camera.

If I had problems 1-3 and the call quality/reception was fine, I'd keep it, but since its main function is so fickle, the phone doesn't offer any other redeeming qualities."
B078NCL7GK,Carlos,4,"So far so good, I have no complain and I guess for the money is not too bad. This phone has a much better screen glass compared to others low badge smartphone. The phone responded pretty fast and the battery is one of the kind probably the best feature in this mobile phone. In fact, everything functioned as should be. And like I said before for the price it is a good toy. An update, the phone is still working perfectly with the new EMUI 8.0.0 Android version...The speaker is another great feature it can be heard 150 ft away inside my house. Good phone for the price, I'm impress."

Hola, soy miembro Prime de amazon.
El servicio al cliente es pÃ©simo, poco cortes y para nada empÃ¡ticos .
hace dÃ­as compre el celular HUAWEI HONOR7x Black color, ya que en la descripciÃ³n del producto mostraba que el honor 7x color negro tenia unas caracterÃ­sticas especiales las cuales eran las mostradas en en la imagen y vÃ­deo que acabo de subir, es decir, 4GB RAM Y 64GB ROM.
Cuando recibo el producto solo tiene 3gb Ram y 32gb Rom NO (4GB RAM Y MENOS 64GB ROM).
Cuando contacto al Customer Service me dicen que ellos ven todo bien y que no es como yo digo ya que no pueden ver la informaciÃ³n DE 4GB RAM Y 64 ROM y que como mÃ¡ximo lo Ãºnico que pueden hacer es una etiqueta de devoluciÃ³n donde yo debo correr con los cargos (gastos) de enviÃ³ entre otros gastos ya que no estoy en estados unidos.
yo compro de forma frecuente utilizando la amazonApp Movil y el mismo dÃ­a que compre el celular compre un Cover, protector de pantalla y una memoria MicroSD de 128GB todo eso para el telÃ©fono honor 7x.
el Customer Service procediÃ³ ha enviarme una etiqueta de devoluciÃ³n sin yo solicitarla y luego cerro el Chat sin permitirme responderla..
En varios Chat les insistÃ­ a que verificaran la AppMovil y no me hicieron caso ya que yo en mi descontento busque varias personas y les pedÃ­ abrieran sus AppMovil y seleccionen el honor 7x black y a ellos les salia la misma informaciÃ³n que a mi.

Les pregunte a uno de los de servicio al cliente si ellos estÃ¡n colocando publicidad engaÃ±osa a lo que respondÃ­an que no ven nada de lo que yo les estoy hablando y que me leyera las polÃ­ticas de devoluciÃ³n para que devolviera el celular."
B078NCL7GK,H. Miller,5,"We never buy expensive phones, so when we needed to replace our smartphones, I read a lot of reviews. Settled on these for husband and I. So glad we did. We've only had them about 2 weeks, but we're very happy with them. Read other reviews for details. Responsive, clear sound, good picture quality."
B078NCL7GK,Blue Moon,4,"Had this phone since Prime Day now. Had iPhones since 2011. No way I'm going to pay $800+ for a device these days. Never heard of this brand but took a gamble. I've been pleasantly surprised. Lots of pros and cons to consider if you are coming from an iPhone or you're just curious about this product. Just a side note, there is an option to unlock this phone using your face rather than your fingerprint if you like. It works quite well. I tried to trick it using photographs of myself and it never unlocked. It was quite intelligent.

PROS

-Expandable memory: I love the ability to store all of my photos/videos/music on a separate drive and never having to worry about running out of memory. This feature is like having a credit card without a limit.

-Battery life: I can get up to two days on a full charge. Sometimes I forget when I last charged the device. 30% can last all day. With the iPhone, that meant an hour or two :(

-Huge screen: I never want to go back to the smaller iPhones now!

-Speed: This phone is fast! Apps open quick and the fingerprint sensor recognizes your touch almost instantly.

CONS

-Brightness: Screen could be a bit brighter, especially in broad daylight.

-Bluetooth delay: My biggest gripe. If you have a Bluetooth headset, you will notice a delay in movies or YouTube videos. Read other reviews on here. It's just the way it is. Apparently it's due to the shared wifi and BT antennas. Nothing I have tried can solve the issue (developer settings, factory resets, different headsets). Restarting the phone will work temporarily but eventually the phone will delay again. Huge bummer since iPhones never had this problem. You could run a wired headset but who wants to use those?

-No NFC: This means no Android pay capability :(. I still have to carry my wallet around I guess.

-Camera: Like everyone says, it's pretty bad in the dark. It also takes really blurry pics if you have a shaky hand. There may be more settings I haven't played around with, but in all honesty I've been more impressed with photos from Apple's 8MP phones than ones from this phone that claims to shoot at twice the megapixels. Pics get much worse if you use the zoom.

-No wireless charging. At this price, I can't really call this a con, but rather a missed luxury.

-Vibration: The vibrator is much weaker compared to any other phone I have owned. If I have the phone in my front pocket, I will not even feel the vibration from a text message.

All in all, I only paid $167 shipped on Prime day for this phone. I'd buy it again even at the current price. Hopefully the manufacturer will read these comments and fix the Bluetooth delay and maybe I'll upgrade to the next version. I will wait for the reviews before I buy though!"
B078NCL7GK,TEE-MAN,5,This is the second Honor phone my wife has had and she loves it. She dropped her last one and cracked the screen because she didn't have a protective case on it. She got many years of use out of it before this happened. We just decided to buy her a new one for $200.00 instead of having her screen replaced on the one she dropped. You can't go wrong with this phone purchase.
B078NCL7GK,Sandra,5,"I have been loving my Honor 7x so far :) It arrived quicker than expected, the phone came with its charger and a clear case.

For a budget phone, I am happy with its specs. I like both cameras, the phone is fast, specially its sensor for unlocking.

And the battery so far is great. I am a mid to heavy user, and it has lasted 1 day perfectly.

If I watch a 2 hour movie, it only takes off like 20% from the battery, which I think is great.

I have watched two movies so far with the same performance. Around 20%-25% of battery use.

The only cons I have found after a few weeks of use is the fact that the phone lags a bit when using the camera, specially switching from rear & front camera.

I don't know if it's a bug, but for the price I paid, I am a happy user!"
B078NCL7GK,Ross M,1,"The 2nd sim card slot is only 2G. Telus here in Ontario Canada does not operate on 2g. The main sim card is 2g,3g,4g. Does not work on Telus with dual sim, one sim card only.

UPDATE - phone gets randomly stuck in a constant reboot , turning on and off and gets very hot. I am returning the phone.

I wanted to like the phone but not really being dual sim and the complete unrealibilty due to occasionally turning on and off constantly I have to return it."
B078NCL7GK,CMay2424,5,"I bought my husband this phone to replace his Samsung S6. He dropped his Samsung one time and after that the screen would flash on and off especially when the battery got low. I refused to pay another $800 for a phone and the reviews on this phone were great. So far my husband loves it, especially the battery life which he says is awesome. He can watch videos and play on his phone all day and not need to charge it. His Samsung wouldn't last even half the day. It is definitely competitive/comparable with these overpriced iPhones and Samsung phones."
B078NCL7GK,Ashwin,5,Excellent phone for an excellent price...
B078NCL7GK,JB,5,"I've owned the Honor 6x in the past, and since it worked for me I was pretty confident the 7x would be no different. With prices of phones getting higher and higher I was looking for something that wasn't so expensive; I'd just returned the Mate 10 Pro for this very reason and decided to stick with Honor/Huawei.

I love that it gets VoLTE on my carrier (T-mobile), and that it includes a case in the box - definitely something other phone companies need to do. The handfeel is a HUGE improvement over the 6x, and though it's not what the market considers premium (glass) I like that if I went without a case the device would probably be ok too.

So far battery life has been about what my 6x was able to do, and for my usage/needs that's more than enough - I can get through a day in with 60% remaining, and that suites me just fine. I'm not a gamer, my apps are mostly time killers/utility apps, but I haven't had the device slow when switching or freeze while trying to load something.

EMUI isn't something that's a deal breaker for me, in fact I love that it has features that I sometimes have to unlock with an app or ADB on other devices (night mode, fingerprint scanner gestures, mobile hotspot toggle, data toggle, etc); about the only thing I wish it would include is the ability to load customer icons and/or make the default icons smaller.

Overall for what I paid for the phone I'm extremely satisfied right now, even if it does get an Android 8.0 update I'll still consider this money well spent as the feature set is pretty killer. There's some good competition in this space, so definitely look around but I'm happy with my purchase."
B078NCL7GK,george cerezo jr,2,"I originally had the ZTE blade. However that phone kept on glitching. Yet I still enjoyed the thickness of the phone. So I did my research and looked for phone that was supposedly supposed to be the same equivalent in size. After reading reviews and checking the price range I seen that this phone was ranking High so I decided to give it a go. After having this phone for approximately 6 months there are several things that irritate me. First the phone is not the same thickness as my previous phone it's very slim. Yes I know that's a personal preference not a flaw of the phone in general but if you're looking for a phone that's thick do not allow the stats on the phone too deceive you. Secondly, the phone jack does not work meaning if you want to plug in headphones it doesn't work. If I'm using the Bluetooth feature and try to sync it with another Bluetooth feature and speak the speaker and Bluetooth features on the phone seem to jump in between each other glitching. Also while browsing or going through several apps the screen tents to become non-responsive to touch. Overall this phone has many settings that are somewhat confusing and it does not play well or nice with other devices I don't know if that's because it's a foreign phone or what. But I would not recommend this phone"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I never give 5 stars, but again the Honor line has left me astounded. I LOVED my Honor 6x...but after a year in my back pocket, it had like a 10Â° bow in the frame and glass. Never a crack or problem, till I sat on it one too many times, but unlike an iPhone, I never had a crack, scratch, or screen problem. It just had a butt-impression as bad as my couch, and it started messing with my beloved, amazing, dual lense camera.

Now the upgrade. Am in love again. How can this camera get better? I bought the 6x and figured it was a camera with a phone attached. Now it's a better camera with a way better OS, speed, screen, everything.

No matter Android or Apple, you simply cannot this amount of bang for the buck. This is a thermonuclear blast for your buck.

Did I mention this is an amazing camera?"
B078NCL7GK,Roger Herman,5,"Phone performes at the price level. It is fairly fast and not laggy but i dont download alot of apps etc. so i dont clog it up much, happy with the performance so far. screen is just o.k. its not amoled but it'll do. my only dissapointment lies with the camerea...its barely decent. my last phone was an asus zen phone 3 zoom and the camera on that phone was top notch so i was a little spoiled. all in all worth 199.00 i guess but my next phone will have a better camera."
B078NCL7GK,AlexIsOz,4,"So here's the thing. This phone is great, especially for the price. But you need to know going in that it's running EMUI. So it's gonna have some... issues. Sometimes it'll log you out of Chrome and there's just nothing to do. Both Huawei and Google know about this, but it's just kinda random luck. The screen looks beautiful, the camera is decent. Overall really happy with it.

Also, it's notifications are weird and I have no idea why. Like, it just won't give you notifications sometimes and you can't peek."
B078NCL7GK,Robby Dougs,3,Not a bad phone but inferior to the Honor 5x. I loved that phone and when i smashed it on accident i looked for an upgrade. The camera is better then a Honor 5x but everything else is worse. The bluetooth and wifi use the same antenna. When i use my bose headphones on youtube the video lags in anything higher that 280p. When i turn off the wifi and use 4g everything is golden. Good thing i have unlimited data. The GPS is basicaly usless. Im not sure if its something ive done but the GPS is constantly seaching for signal. I have to basicaly hold out my window to get to catch signal but ill lose it constantly. So that is to be desired. All not a bad phone for 200 but i would not recommend or repurchase as it has many feature that are not usable.
B078NCL7GK,Kaushik Ravikumar,5,Just got this phone yesterday and my first impression was that the build quality and look & feel of this phone is just amazing for the price. Battery performance seems to be stellar and I did not face any lag while accessing my applications. Touchwood!
B078NCL7GK,David,5,"I bought this phone after doing a little research and deciding that I needed something with more memory than my Samsung On5. I have MetroPCS and they don't always give the best opportunity to get a good deal on a new phone if you already have them so I bought this one from Amazon and figured at $199, I can't really go wrong. The phone has exceeded my expectations in every way so far. The screen is larger than my old phone and it has 4 times the internal memory, the processing speed has had no problem so far. The cameras work great, the graphics are clear, the battery life is amazing. For the price, I really can't complain, also it showed it would not be in stock until the 26th (I ordered on the 24th), instead it ended up shipping the same day I ordered (the afternoon of the 24th) and arrived the next day! So far I'm very pleased with this phone!"
B078NCL7GK,RAUL ELNITIARTA,5,"This Honor 7x is surprisingly excellent. If you don't need th experience bells and whistles of top of the line smartphones, get this one.
Note: I got this for my daughter to replace her Asus Zenphone II Laser. She loves it so far. It fits her criteria : bigger screen, not too bulky, fingerprint sensor, dual lens camera, headphone jack, pretty color (we got the blue one)."
B078NCL7GK,Michelle,5,I bought this after my Samsung S7 shit the bed. This is just as good and only at a fraction of the price. I think I'm done with flagship phones after realizing you're paying for nothing more than the name... And they're designed to fail after a certain amount of time anyway. Capitalism at its finest lol
B078NCL7GK,Stephen Ludwig,5,"Upgraded from my old K20 plus to this. Works amazingly and the camera portrait mode makes pictures look amazing. For all those asking, yes it works with Metro PCS. You just have to call and say that you got a new phone that is confirmed to work on their service and provide them the information they request."
B078NCL7GK,M.E. Pepper,2,Phone worked great for about five months then intermittently doesn't allow incoming calls to come through. Completely random. Incoming calls at different times from different phones randomly go directly to voicemail (I'm told). These calls don't even register on my call log. Also if my phone's been inactive for a bit and I make a call or send a text all of a sudden I'll get a bunch of texts pop up all at once. Trying to figure out how the warranty works. Very disappointed.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I am SO GLAD I bought this phone. I love everything about it! The storage is great, the photo quality is amazing, the fingerprint scanner works wonderfully. The only teensy tiny problem is how small the notification light is, I hardly notice it.
I haven't updated it because a past review said it messed up their phone, so I'm avoiding it."
B078NCL7GK,Philip,5,"Plug and play phone that was easy to setup and switch. I was a loyal Samsung user but with the price of an average smartphone, I was ready to veer off the path and I couldn't be happier for $200. The phone feels like it's of quality materials, has excellent battery life, and connects seamlessly to Bluetooth devices. I wouldn't recommend this phone to a data junkie or someone who loves taking pictures, as the camera of my Galaxy s4 was better than this one and the internal storage isn't the best but it does have an micro SD card slot, so at least the storage can be remedied. Overall a great buy. I've been using without a hitch for over 2weeksðððª"
B078NCL7GK,Bloody_Breeze,5,I like the phone a lot. I'm coming from an apple phone and I'm impressed. This they mid-range phone and it do so much more than the x. I got me a 256 gb memory card for the joint and I can put all my pirated music on it. No more apple music payments. And you can lock your apps for your girl won't be all in the joint . Facial recognition. Good camera And I made some good movies with it already. Umm I'm sticking Huawei from nown on. Bluetooth stay connected as well
B078NCL7GK,erik kastning,5,"this is an amazing phone. I used this phone for 6 months and loved it. it did everything my Samsung Note 5 did for the most part. I did have some issues when it came to missing APs on google play store but that could have been the version of android installed on the phone. The battery life is great. I could go all day at work with out needing a charge. The phone worked for UBER and Lyft while playing music.

The only thing that was not great on the phone was the camera quality but I watched dozens of reviews and knew it wasn't the best coming in."
B078NCL7GK,Markevee,1,"So the GPS on this thing is horrendous, it seems to only take readings around every half a minute or so, and it won't work for Pokemon Go or Google maps navigation. Other than that it is a near perfect phone, especially considering the price. I went to hihonor.com and talked to a honor representative about my GPS problem, but they just told me to factory reset my phone and It didn't fix my problem."
B078NCL7GK,DKPHX,5,I needed a backup phone and have previously used other brands that were much more expensive. For the money this phone does an exceptionally good job. I was expecting much less and got so much more.
B078NCL7GK,Donald Duck,4,"Very cheap, very high quality. Nifty fingerprint sensor is far more convenient than normal passwords. The only catch is that the company that makes these phones is famous for spying on it's customers, to the point that the DOD bans the sale of these phones on government property.

Of course, I'm sure Google does more spying than whatever it is the chinese manufacturer does (after all, it is in china that google is testing all of the latest and greatest consumer spying, censoring, and manipulation methods), but if privacy is a concern, don't buy this phone.

Other than that, very great phone for very cheap."
B078NCL7GK,Rob Porter,5,"Love this phone. I will never buy a 1000 dollar phone again and get locked into 2 year contracts. Screen resolution is beautiful. It takes high quality pictures which makes it stand out from other phones in this price range. looks, feel and acts like a much more expensive phone. Was super easy to set up on my AT&T account. Set up in seconds."
B078NCL7GK,jamie beets,5,"Great phone, extremely happy with it. Snappy performance for a ""so called"" budget phone that is borderline flagship quality.

Camera takes amazing picture.

Build quality is superb. It has some weight to it, you actually know when you are holding it in your hand.

Compared to previous phones I have had in the past, this is the best one by far (Note 2, OnePlus One, Moto X Pure, Zenphone 3 Max).

This phone still has a headphone jack, which nowadays is considered a premium feature IMHO. The sound quality from listening with headphones is amazing.

The lack of NFC shouldn't steer you away since NFC payments aren't status quo yet.

Definitely getting the most bang for my buck. Bought a second one for my Daughter"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I have ordered this phone and it is arrived on time. Before this, I have order Moto 4, but that phone was heating up after and not to easy to hold. Honor 7X is one of the best phone without any heating issue. Features are good, Camera is wonderful for average use. Very good processor for playing games. Overall the product is good."
B078NCL7GK,Nedgi D.,5,"I bought this phone for travel purposes. I travel a lot for work and don't feel comfortable going everywhere with my iPhone. So, I take this with me. You can put in 2 sim cards or 1 sim and an SD. It takes calls, pictures, you can load music on the 32Gb and one very nice feature is the clone one that's on the phone. Lets you activate two WhatsApp, Messenger and so on at the same time without having to download an app from the PlayStore.
Overall best $200 phone I've ever had."
B078NCL7GK,D,5,"Best feature: This phone is a bargain at this price point. Lots of the same or similar features as the Google Pixel 2 that cost 3 to 4 times what I paid for this. I'm very satisfied with the quality and appearance of this device and will definitely buy an upgrade Huawei next year.

Worst feature: After two weeks of normal use, my biggest complaint is that I've had to restart the device twice because it locked up. Not a deal breaker by any means."
B078NCL7GK,Leroy A. Hall,3,"This has been an awesome phone until 9 months after I bought it. It still works fine, but for some reason a blue splotch has appeared in the middle of the screen. Getting a hold of Huawei has been a chore, and I have been unable to locate their US service center (if one exists). Next time I stick with either LG or Motorola, as both have been the most durable phones I have owned"
B078NCL7GK,Bishoy,5,Love this phone defiantly great phone and great purchase will recommend it for anyone
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I've had the phone for almost a week and a half. It should be said my uses and needs are basic; I only use it to browse, read, watch YouTube, and other basic stuff.

PROS
- Screen ratio is really good I like it alot. Splendid for reading and writing even. Split screen is awesome too.
- Battery lasts about two days with casual use.
- Price is of course unbeatable for a new smartphone that works well.
- Overall UI is alright
-32gb storage

CONS
-Only 2.4ghz wifi. Not deal breaker but would be nice
-I have had it glitch out once or twice, where no apps work properly for a period but that could be an app problem. It corrected itself soon enough.
- Takes forever to charge. Almost 2 hours from low battery if I remember correctly.
- Bluetooth has glitched off a few times.
- GSM only.

These are all the pros and cons I can think of in my case. I'm not a heavy user though.

Overall, even with the cons I'm happy with the phone. I'll have to update this post with how it's held up in a few weeks."
B078NCL7GK,JB,5,"I purchased this for my high school son to replace his old Tracfone cell phone. It is easy to transfer from old tracfone device to this honor 7x as long as the new sim card is inserted into it. The phone number and minutes left in the old phone are kept. After about 2 weeks usage, my son like it very much and feel pretty good on the camera, finger print unlock feature and sort of Apps provided by the manufacturer."
B078NCL7GK,jjdownam,2,"I've lived with this phone for seven months. I bought it to replace my Galaxy s8. It is honestly an alright phone. I've only recently noticed slowdowns and weird random glitchyness. This phone just really doesn't compare to any of the previous Samsung phones i've used and for the price I really wish it had more to offer.

Save yourself some money and go for a Samsung or an Apple."
B078NCL7GK,Deja,3,"This phone is generally a good phone. If I never took pictures I'd love it, especially for the price. However, I am a mom and my main use of my phone is taking pictures of my kid (at least it feels that way! Haha). I've definitely noticed a huge difference in the quality of photos compared to my last phone, a Nexus 5x. I plan to find another phone with a better camera and pass this one to my husband who uses his phone mainly to play games."
B078NCL7GK,Kameron,5,"I am loving this phone, I did months and months of research on what phone to get and I started at the s9+, for the dual cameras but eventually I found this, a great phablet with dual cameras that blow the doors off 500$ flagships. In the end what got me hooked was the amazing battery life, big screen and dual cameras. And honestly, you can't go wrong for a phone of this price (especially when upgrading from a galaxy s4)"
B078NCL7GK,Javid,5,"I don't know how long it will survive, but the phone is perfect. when you watch video in this phone the quality is not so high. But for this price it is very nice phone. I order one for my mom, and I will order one more for my dad)"
B078NCL7GK,Megan Erin Pallante,5,"I'm loving this phone so far. I came from the nightmare that is BLU, and Huawei is leagues ahead (which is interesting when remembering that BLU rips off Huawei phones...). Anyway, it takes some getting used to the new UI, but that is true of all non-pure Android phones. The phone has a snappy response, takes decent photos, and simply *works*. I play a lot of phone games, and it holds up well with that demand."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"It's great! If you want to spend 800+ $ for the phone that's completely fine. Camera is great however if you want to take action shots ie games your doggie running you want get it obviously. But for the money you save you can actually get a decent camera for that. As far as apps, emei etc. Hey I got this phone to replace my Nexus 5. Yes I keep it for almost 5 years. I am more than satisfied. It is an amazing phone. I compared moto5x in any review I could and couldn't be happier to choose Honor7x. I hope that Amazon will continue to carry Huawei products unlike what Best Buy did. Price/features ratio 20/10."
B078NCL7GK,Edgar lopez,5,"It's the best phone you can get for $200. The aluminum build is awesome but if your going to get the blue one because you think it looks good I would reconsider the black color. The blue isn't bad and my friends are always asking me about it but I think the black would have been a good too. The camera is actually really good if your patient with your shot, none of these photos are edited in any way because I know some people will try to make that point. I come from an iPhone 6s plus so I definitely recommend this if you want an Android device that can do just about anything you ask it to do."
B078NCL7GK,B. Chiu,4,"So far so good. It's not water resistant and I know the Moto G6 is supposed to be better, but for the prime day price of 169, I had to go with this. It even came with a clear case! If its' still running in 1 year, I'll bump this to a 5. If it doesn't, I'll drop it to a 3."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I'm from the USA and am currently going through family mobile. I have no issues with my service. Setting it up was a pain but that was on family mobile'side. If you are already a family mobile user than I would recommend purchasing a byop Sim card online while you wait for the phone to be delivered as they are $1 compared to the $55 you are forced to purchase in the store (comes with one month of service but still charging you $25 for the sim) other than that, I absolutely love this phone and will be purchasing another for my fiance."
B078NCL7GK,Jason Fox,4,"Good size phone, feels well made. Awesome battery life. Good looking screen. I've had the phone for less than a year and there are some problems too. It used to randomly think I was in Chicago several times a day, changing the phone time and causing me to miss some alarms. It won't recognize an external microscope plugged in to the USB port where every other phone I've tried works fine. Tried it in Google cardboard glasses and was unusable. The position tracking was all over the place. Screen brightness is usually all the way at the bottom and if I slide it up the tiniest bit, the screen gets super bright right away. None of this is enough to get me to buy another phone. For the around $200 I payed, it is certainly a usable phone if I get a years use out of it. I guess I was spoiled with $600+ Samsung phones before."
B078NCL7GK,GameHEADtime,5,"Great Phone
-Nice display!
-Great software!
-Clean!
-Comes with case!
-Low price!
-Good performance!

Suggestion
-Add full glass protector
-improve cpu speed"

The gps never works, data speed is extremely slow, and I havenât even install much apps yet the phone was already slowing down like crazy, even the phone says I have 1GB of ram left it still lag like crazy and barely could switch between apps"
B078NCL7GK,Jen Jen,3,"The phone is ultra sleek and the blue is beautiful. The finger print scanner is pretty accurate and it does have some nice features, but reception is really poor. I would blame it on the network but others don't seem to have the same issue with other phones."
B078NCL7GK,adamayus,3,"Bought this phone cause I had the older honor and enjoyed it and liked the upgrade on the speed and picture quality on this phone and came with a U.S. warranty. Got the phone loved the look and the beautiful pictures only down side was when you zoomed to far it got blocky but not a bad deal for a 200.00 dollar phone. The issue was after 2 weeks the phone started having issues not receiving texts or calls, then screen started fading and wifi as well as my 4LTE stopped working. Got no help from the customer service no replacement even tho it was warrantied. So I had to spend another 200 dollars with in two weeks for a new phone. Very let down on honor."
B078NCL7GK,GL!+cH,4,"This is a decent phone for less than a fortune. Sound quality is fairly good; photo/camera quality could stand to improve which was surprising to me.

I also miss having the option to set specific ringtones AND text sounds to each contact like with the Samsung Galaxy; but no biggie.

I'll update once I've had the thing longer than 4 hours"
B078NCL7GK,DrStock,5,"Was anxious to get delivery on this phone, and was not disappointed when I received it today. Absolutely awesome. I got the blue one, and it is beautiful. Feels like my son's very expensive iPhone. The finger scan instantly unlocks. Watched some Amazon prime today. Big bright screen and speaker is great, too. I used the Huawei phone clone app, and it worked flawlessly transferring everything from my old Samsung S4. This feels like a huge upgrade, as you can imagine. No need to hesitate on this $200 phone. Will try to update after a few weeks."
B078NCL7GK,John L. Belliveau,5,"I had the two previous versions of this phone and I love this one the best.
It's fast, nice screen.
The best feature of this phone for me is the battery life. At the end of they day I normally have 50% to 74% battery life.
If I break this phone, I'd buy it again (or it's upgrade) I use it with an AT&T sim I got from straighttalk."
B078NCL7GK,Gordie,5,I have an Hornor 6x that is a real good phone. But there were a couple of things that I didn't care for. Those problems were solved with the 7x. For $200 it is a steal. I've only had the phone for a day but I see and expect good things from this phone.
B078NCL7GK,shizlady7,5,"This was purchased for one of my family, several others have this same cell phone -- all of them LOVE it. It is very easy to use, takes really clear pictures, functions well, fits easy into the holster-type cover. Great phone!"
B078NCL7GK,Just me....Just Louie....,5,"Excellent, excellent phone for the price. I have friends who are locked into contracts who tell me they wish they weren't because this phone has changed their mind about unlocked GSM phones. If you use Straight Talk like I do, this is a great phone to have. Highly recommended."
B078NCL7GK,Scott Gerhardt,1,"An unauthorized update essentially broke my phone for my purposes. Inexcusable. CS refused to fix it. Also, a small drop that would have been fine with any other phone shattered the screen. Avoid this company."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,I have always purchased cellphone brands that were less popular. I bought BLU phones for 5 years. I ran across this phone and gave it a chance based on the awesome specs. I bought an at&t byop kit for straight talk and it worked immediately. Awesome phone. Easy to use. Beautiful in every way. I'm glad I went with this one....
B078NCL7GK,miguel,5,Works amazing for the price! Can't get anything better than this for the price. The huawei mate se is the exact same thing but has 64gb internal memory and 4gb ram if you perfer that for 250$ and the huawei y9 is 230$ and has dual rear and dual front cameras with 4000mah battery so if you want a better camera and battery go for that one but other than that its almost identical to the honor 7x and the mate se. I was happy with the specs and price on the honor 7x so i chose this one and so far it's worked really good.
B078NCL7GK,seasidewildbirdrescue,4,High resolution and fairly snappy speeds. It feels substantial with the metal case. The software for the camera makes it more useful and the picture quality is good with the proper lighting. Sound is only adequate from the one speaker. Call quality is ok. Sometimes the GPS loses contact with the satellite during navigation. The phone is good for 160 dollars. It would be great for 100.
B078NCL7GK,J. Kirk,5,"Great battery life so far and tons of features. Fingerprint scanner is quick and the overall performance is snappy.

Two big things it's lacking are a Type C port and AC Wifi but for $200 I'm not going to complain."
B078NCL7GK,SKIPPYONE,5,"Very satisfied so far, have had for a couple of weeks now & can't believe how good this phone is! Don't think I'll ever go back to paying those outrageous prices for another brand again. Went to Best buy & was browsing when a worker there told me he had this brand & loved it, I'll pass it along!"
B078NCL7GK,Anndriska Roberts,5,"So far I have used this phone for two weeks straight, the battery holds up good from a full charge in the morning 5am to 2pm without charging and at full performance. Have upgraded the software to Android 8 and it still runs smoothly, I had one hiccup when I just got it but not since the update. The camera is great with great quality detail. Each shot is captured nicely. I can do plenty with this phone if the internet works with me, split screen and various other functions that I am discovering everyday."
B078NCL7GK,alaskanchick,5,"I just purchased this, and it's a great phone so far. First off, the battery is fantastic. It charges really fast and lasts all day long. The screen is bright and has a quality picture. There's tons of storage space. Honestly, I don't know what more to say, other than I just love it so far. Of course, we'll see how it does in the long term, but so far, it's a great phone. Especially for the price!"
B078NCL7GK,Bryan Lantry,3,"Good deal for a budget phone.. seems to lag behind when mutli tasking.. ok camera quality, though the camera response time is laggy at times. Ok for video playback..1080p ac3 is poor. Recommend no more than 720p videos."
B078NCL7GK,Sam,5,Great phone for 200 bucks l. Anyone who says it sucks cause they cracked it is a wast of time. I cracked mine because i was being ignorent so buy a case. So far i love this phone i had an HTC one M8. This phone is good for gameing and almost never lags . It's comparable to the phone 7s and the Samsung Galaxy S8
B078NCL7GK,Nathaniel Gibbings,5,"Pros:
From the software features, of which there are many (go look up videos of things you can do with this phone!), to the beautiful screen, and the lightning fast fingerprint scanner, this phone is the best bang for your buck on the market. It's durable, I've dropped it and had no issues, the aluminium back was scratched, but not very much, and that's to be expected.

Cons:
Low light environments do not fare well with the phone's camera, however at this price point you can only get so much camera wise. There isn't as much RAM as one would like, the processing power isn't particularly incredible, and not having USB-C is a bit annoying, but once again, you can only get so much at this price point.

Overall: I will tentatively say that it is currently the best phone on the market for $200 or less."
B078NCL7GK,Draegos,1,"I bought this phone in March of 2018. I haven't even owned it a year. The battery is swelling and it's disfigured the whole phone. The screen is slowly popping out and there's discoloration on the screen from the pressure. Apparently this is an early warning sign that the battery's getting ready to explode. The battery cannot be removed or replaced on this phone, of course, so the whole phone is now useless. The cause of this is a battery with cheap, sub-standard materials in it. And that's apparently what this phone uses. Buyer beware."
B078NCL7GK,Carlos,5,"Wow, what a decent phone for 200 monies.
Picture? CRYSTAL

Performance? SUPERCAR

Storage? EXPANDABLE BABY! but decent.

Camera? NOT AT NIGHT! Also decent though.

Battery? AVERAGE AT BEST! but not terrible.

Sound? WHO NEEDS GOOD SPEAKERS? The 7x apparently.

But I am a happy boy with a shiny toy."
B078NCL7GK,Rafael Augusto,5,"Muy bueno el telÃ©fono, era para regalarlo y lo Ãºnico que me hizo fue que no me guardo los contactos pero despuÃ©s muy muy bueno el telÃ©fono, resuelve, tiene buena cÃ¡mara y es econÃ³mico en comparaciÃ³n a como lo venden en mi paÃ­s."
B078NCL7GK,VeiledAxiom,5,I have dropped twice today. No scratch or dent on the steal body. Screen still looks brand new. Phone is mostly water proof except phone speaker. Don't submerge it on purpose. great for people who sweat and ruin their phones. This phone is just as good as Samsung and iPhone. I've had both. I feel ripped off by both companies. Buy this phone you will not regret it !!!
B078NCL7GK,Kindle Customer,5,"Iâve just returned from a trip to Europe and Africa and used the phone as my travel phone. It worked as advertised and I am glad I got it. Iâve owned an iPhone for several years and my experience with this phone and android was pretty good. Highly recommend it especially for the price, quality, and functionality."
B078NCL7GK,Gadget Freak,4,"Considering its price (I paid $180) this is an exceptional phone. The camera is above average, obviously not a good as the higher end cameras on newer Samsungs and iPhones but for my purposes, good enough. Workmanship is phenomenal. An included app made it a breeze copying apps and settings from my older (also android) phone. Highly recommended."
B078NCL7GK,Dongwoo Kim,4,"Itâs an impressive device for $200. But for some people, paying more to get a better phone still makes sense. Also, no 5GHz Wi-Fi and no NFC are two big bummers. I wouldâve liked to see USB-C, but Honor has to reach their price, so oh well. Overall solid for $200."
B078NCL7GK,Papa Tony,5,"A truly beautiful phone, and a budget one too, a very high class phone . And no one will know. Buy you will not regret, oh, I got my 8.0 Oreo download a week laterð"
B078NCL7GK,lorenzo,5,"This was one of the best phones I've gotten myself in the recent years, so good in fact someone thought they have it, not me. I am a college student and its ability for dual application use and its super fast speed really saved me (and my GPA) more than once. I would recommend this for anyone who needs top of the line but is also on a budget. The only thing I would warn people with is to keep it close to you, and always check your pockets. I plan to order a new one in the near future."
B078NCL7GK,Alexa N,5,Honor phones are not just hype. Got this for my Mom to replace her samsung S7 and she is very happy with the switch. Great larger screen battery life is way better and she can still use her old 128gb memory card. And its running andriod 8 oreo such a great deal.
B078NCL7GK,Jackie,4,Fast smartphone but ended up returning. I do not understand how this is recommended as one of the best budget camera phones and it has such a high megapixel count but it looks very poor. The only thing it provides is more saturated photos but the quality is not really good at all. Fast though
B078NCL7GK,Avid E reader.,4,My son is very happy with this phone. It replaced his note 8 that he broke and I refused to let him spend that kind of money again. He says it does everything his note did it's just not as big.
B078NCL7GK,SUNSHINE,5,"I previously had an old android phone that served my purpose.
I felt it was ready to die on me so my Grandson who is 15
did some research and felt this would be a good phone for me.
I absolutely love it!! Did not know what I was missing. It has good
reviews and I am glad I took my Grandsons advise. Easy to use
and if beautiful. Lots of tutorials on YouTube if you need some
help figuring things out and lots of tips and shortcuts.. Awesome phone."
B078NCL7GK,Henry,2,"Was a sweet pickup until it started having problems after two months. I bought and received the Honor7x in Feb, and writing this review in mid April. I was thinking of writing the review after using it for three months, but it's suddenly been problem after problem. First month went by fine. I enjoyed the camera and it ran fairly smooth. Fingerprint sensor is really quick.. Now for the cons; calls don't last more than 15 minutes before it disconnects and I have to recall. It wasn't a big problem, but now calls won't last a minute. I've been experiencing some strange stutter when switching between basic apps. My phone has also randomly crashed about 4-5 times and just rebooted by itself. Sadly, this is all within only two months. Who knows what else will random start malfunctioning. Nice phone in specs, but save your money and perhaps look elsewhere."
B078NCL7GK,Roobs,5,Wanted a good sized screen & performance . It has exceeded my expectations. A quality product made for a higher range. Thank you for the speedy delivery. I have been putting my 7x through the paces and happy with results.
B078NCL7GK,KIKUSA,5,"Beautiful and powerful, this device is so friendly and easy to use, I have using it for a couple of days without problems or lags, the performance is superior and the quality is unbearable like they say. I'm a happy owner of this Honor 7 x"
B078NCL7GK,Dev,4,"I don't know how to start my review on this. Because im so happy after receiving this phone. It's so stunning and cool and really easy to use. The battery backup is going well than other android device I used before. 100% of charging easily goes long for whole day. Even i used it heavily gps, music and apps. Its a well valued phone and amazon.com delivery is amazing always on time. And i want to advice the packing department of Amazon warehouse please use some bubble wrap or plastic bags with the product. Don't throw the only item in the box. I know you guys worried about your rates but please think about customers item not to be damaged in that way. Rate only 4star because of packing not well done..."
B078NCL7GK,trieger,4,I really like this phone. There are many cool features that don't come with other phones at this price point. There are a few quirks that are keeping me from giving 5 stars. I'm slightly tech savvy and I don't mind the quirks but I wouldn't recommend this phone to a person that isn't tech savvy.
B078NCL7GK,jinghuajin,4,Got the phone. Surprising me a lot. Only 200 dollars. But works axcelant for me. Texting is good. Searching Google is good. Everything is good enough for me. That is all the review for those 5 days I use.
B078NCL7GK,Robert Farrell,5,"One of my favorite phones I have ever owned... at a fraction of the price. Very well built. Fast. Great screen. Very good (not fantastic) camera.
Updated to Oreo without issues. I miss the lack of NFC. I miss USB C. But WOW! I will definitely buy the next version of this phone. Warning for smaller hands: it is 3 inches wide. You may not find that very handy...."
B078NCL7GK,christine,3,"Upon receipt, phone shape not as attractive as in photos. I also never expected it to be so big - a bit cumbersome. Someone else bought another Huawei just before mine and both surfaces crack after just one fall. I've owned other brands before and they were more durable."
B078NCL7GK,KingSmitty24,5,After buying this phone I think I'm done with Samsung for good!!
B078NCL7GK,Esander,3,"The phone looks great and is easy to navigate, but everything is super glitchy. I've not yet had it for a year and there are a ton of issues. It won't scroll up when I'm trying to see back in a text, you can't archive texts, no visual voicemail works, my GPS is failing/not accurate... I could go on and on. Not sure why this is happening. About to start looking for a new phone."
B078NCL7GK,Jacob Bolzenius,3,"I've had this phone for about 8 months at this point. Overall I'm pretty happy and it works well. I'm quite disappointed with the camera specifically. It performs poorly in moderate to low light (smudgy, pastel-looking pictures) and I have essentially stopped taking pictures of my 18 month old child with it, whereas my prior phone (Google Nexus 5x) performed without complaint in the same scenarios. Pictures look okay outdoors or in well lit areas. But for a budget phone or a bridge to tide you over if you don't want to splurge on a nicer model for another couple years, this one will work pretty well overall."
B078NCL7GK,lukeslorelai,5,Loving this phone. I bought this one after my iPhone start glitching and was informed it was about to completely die on me. I think it was a financially wise decision... Honor for $200 vs iPhone for $700-$1000. INSTANT SAVINGS!
B078NCL7GK,Heather Rigg,5,"I am normally an LG person, but this phone really took me. I was surprised with the amount of available settings and customisation of the phone. Phone calls are great, SMS works well, 4G datab no complaints here and definitely the best phone I've had yet."
B078NCL7GK,alberto salinas,5,Mine freezes from time to time but I run alot of big apps at the same time and I understand this is a budget phone. It looks and feels good and is very well built and its features always work. The camera is brings up alot of red but besides that it's amazing.
B078NCL7GK,Kaiser Sose,5,"Honestly, I can't believe how cheap this phone is. It is really good for the price. Is it not as fast or lacks certain features of the $1000 flagship phone on the market today? Yes, of course it does. However, in my opinion, those features do not equal the price differential between this and a flagship."
B078NCL7GK,Angela Caruthers,5,"I got this phone a month ago as I switched from my old Samsung phone to this and it went through easy, the phone still works fast but at times it can slow down if you have a lot of apps in the background, but not much of a worry. The camera is very great has a lot of features on it making it useful for taking photos. The screen is very good, lots of color on it. It's battery lasts for about 14 hours on heavy usage for me which is pretty good. Over all I haven't found any other issues or anything I didn't like so I really would recommend this phone."
B078NCL7GK,clam608,5,"I bought this phone on Amazon and have been using it for 2 weeks. It looks premium and shockingly beautiful for a $200 phone. All the apps run smoothly and fast especially browsing the net, watching youtube video and playing games. Bottom line is I'd recommend this phone for those who looks for a decent budget phone instead of wasting money on the overpriced high-end phone."
B078NCL7GK,Kimberly A Guarneri,1,This phone looks nice on the outside but does not have a quality build. After having the phone for 5 months the phone all of the sudden started to display white vertical lines on the display. So I opened a case with Huawei and sent the phone to get repaired since it was still under warranty. Once they received the phone they then told me the phone is showing liquid damage (which was not the case) and wouldn't fix the phone. Don't know how the so called liquid damage would case straight vertical lines to show on the display but obviously didn't want to repair the phone. I guess that is what to expect for a $199 phone made in China. So buyer beware !!!!!
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Perfectly living up to it's billing and the descriptions that got my attention.
Not an expensive option, but gets done, a reasonable level of work that a mobile phone should do."
B078NCL7GK,Brandon,5,"Price is great, phone is great, been using it for over a year now, my wife and I both have one and no issues other than the slight curve to the screen which doesn't allow for glass screen protectors so don't get one, the silicone ones are the only ones that work"
B078NCL7GK,Ron Lawrence,2,"I love this phone in every way but one. There is no way to set a custom sound for applications that use the new notification management in the OS. This restriction is VERY annoying. I can only set one sound for all applications, and no customization for messages, emails, contacts, etc.
Honor / Huwai has not responded to any of the messages I've googled for to answer why they took this out of the OS. Android stock version allows different sounds by each app and even in messages by each contact."
B078NCL7GK,KM,4,"I have been using the honor 7x for a month now and there haven't been any problems. The phone is reliable and fast given its price. For around 200 USD, the phone has many useful features and the battery can last up to around a day on normal use. However, I've found that the phone doesn't run stock Android (like google) but uses EMUI, which is a software with some skins layering android. Nonetheless, the honor 7x has been a breeze to use and I hope it improves in the future."
B078NCL7GK,Christopher,5,"Good:
-18:9 ratio
-Screen (good viewing angle, resolution, size)
-Built quality
-Looks (have gotten compliment)
-Enough storage and RAM
-Battery life (tend to use it in battery saving mode and lasts me the day and sometimes more)

Bad:
-Perhaps the EMUI skin
-Bought the phone with the intention of unlocking bootloader but they stopped providing key (disappointed but not enough to detract from phone's overall quality)

Average:
-Speakers
-micro-USB"
B078NCL7GK,Melody,5,"I just think it can work for call and wechat is enough to my dad. Is very good phone with a very cheap price ever , and prime day has discount . But is too late for me. Anyway my dad loves this phone, deserve to have one."
B078NCL7GK,AKSALA,5,This is the second Honor phone I've purchased. This is one fantastic phone for a very low price. The camera is amazing and the best I've ever seen on a smartphone. I use this phone on a net10 network and have used it on ATT and others. It is a true charmer. Well worth every penny and will be my go to again!
B078NCL7GK,Travis Booker,1,Purchased this some months ago and I REGRET too many problems the sound sucked and picture quality only kept it because i really needed a phone so I delt with it but its now to the point where it gets extremely hot and screen goes blank I haven't dropped it or no water damage spent $20 on a very great protective phone case so its the phone
B078NCL7GK,lu,5,"My wife's Huwaei died and would not hold a charge , Needed a replacement phone I reviewed all the phones available and for the price and specs this was the best available phone. Ordered it and once received set it up with our T-Mobile account. Works well and suits my Wife;s needs. Excellent product"
B078NCL7GK,Erick C,3,"When Honor released the 7X I was all over it since day 1. After owning the 6X I figured the 7X would be worth the upgrade. For $200 you are getting plenty bang for your buck. The blue color is nice, the screen is nice and the camera is okay. But having owned it since February there are some downfalls. Honor still hasn't fixed the auto brightness bug, the touch screen responsiveness is still a bit wonky at times, and the battery is starting to drain pretty quick. On top of these issues, the rattling sound from the camera made me think I had a defective device but it seems to be just the phone itself. I will admit that the 7X does take pretty nice pictures. The phone gets pretty hot quickly during normal usage and the battery drains fast. I never had that issue with the 6X. The lack of cases available for the 7x is also another downfall for me. I just wouldn't consider this device a major upgrade from the 6X. If you have a 6X, hold off until the 8X comes out. If you need a phone, look for another option or wait until the 8X comes out, which should be soon in the US actually!"
B078NCL7GK,Emari Riley howe,5,"I was skeptical, as always. I wanted an iPhone but couldn't afford it. I thought this was going to be a phone wthat would give me problems or something else. But this phone is amazing, fast, sharp, the picture quality when watching things and playing movies is amazing . I highly recommend this phone , you will not regret it."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"Phone runs smooth so far. The only downside is the single antenna making it near impossible to use bluetooth and wifi at the same time. I did have a pretty frustrating experience when I first turned it on and connected it to wifi. After about 5 minutes it kicked me off, and everytime I tried to reconnect to wifi, it showed ""Denied access to network"". I tried forgetting and reconnecting, power cycling the phone and router, and making sure there weren't any MAC filters preventing connection. I finally resolved the issue by updating the phone's software which took 8 hours of using purely data. Since the update went through, the wifi is working perfectly."
B078NCL7GK,Juan O.,4,"The device is working well. I choose to stay with this brand of cellphones since my last Honor ( 6x) worked so well. I had the 6X for 3 years and only towards the end did it start giving me a little trouble (flickering of the screen.). I bought the Honor 7X hoping that this new device works as well for me and most importantly, it last a few years. Can't wait for the Honor 8X"
B078NCL7GK,kat,4,so far so good. takes a bit get use to like most new toys. but strait away. the screen top area is tooo small and annoying. maybe I will find away to make it bigger? but over all fast. feels real classy to. its slimmer than the picture shows it as. so better in person. good weight to it. doesnt feel like gonna snap strait away. LOL
B078NCL7GK,Muhammad A. Qureshi,4,"Decent phone for the price, but don't expect it to work like a Samsung flagship phone.
Pros: Nice big screen, screen brightness works well in Bright Florida Sunlight.
Cons: Slow response occasionally, you can feel the lag after pressing a key. Even crashing sometimes ending in restarting the phone."
B078NCL7GK,Buzzy L Moore,5,"I bought this phone in mid July and it's probably been the best phone I've ever had! After 4 months it doesn't look like it's showing any signs of wear or slowing down! The picture quality on the back camera is amazing, but the front camera definitely has some room for improvement... The only other problem I can think of is that I can't seem to transfer apps from the device to my SD card, but it isn't too much trouble since the phone has a pot of space on it."
B078NCL7GK,@UrbanShredder,5,"I Love it, I'm an iPhone owner and order this phone for my business and WOW for $199 you can have this type of device WOW. Big screen, fast phone, excellent camera, the resolution on the screen is amazing. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on a phone but want a NICE phone get this one! Did I mention it comes with a free case???"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Fantastically camera, good battery life, good gaming graphics, fast and accurate fingerprint scanner. Huawei did it again with this phone: My wife has the 6x that was current when purchased and has also had a fantastic experience, I would expect as much from the 8x that has since been released."
B078NCL7GK,Jairaj Tikam,3,I was coming from a OnePlus 3T which is already a couple years old now. So I thought this device would be at least as fast as the 3T if not faster. But it was really slow performance wise. Another problem was the amount of time it took to charge since it does not come with fast charging. I believe there would be much better phones around the $300 mark. Returned the device after using it for a month.
B078NCL7GK,mickey53usa,5,I have used a different brand for the last 12+ years. Changing carriers so decided to change phone brands - I could not be happier. A colleague had one and really likes it. Bought mine and two others I know also bought them. A great phone for a great price
B078NCL7GK,madlady420,3,"I bought this phone for my son. It was damaged when it was left by the door. The speaker was damaged, the screen had small crack. I wanted an exchange but was refunded and i bought this phone again. But my son said it was good for what he needed. Very nice phone."
B078NCL7GK,Slothy,5,Im very happy with this phone. It keeps up with constant use and maintains a strong battery after not putting a full charge for days on end. I wish there was a more manual option for picture taking but it still takes some great photos.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,3,"I have the Honor 7x for a couple months and I like it. It has all features that much more expense ones have (dual camera, dual sim, finger/face recognition login, etc). Unlike my old phone, there are no finger prints on the screen so it always looks clean. The reason I only give it 3 stars is because panorama photos are blurring under low light. I can only take sharp panorama photos under bright day light. Anyone has this issue?"
B078NCL7GK,Tyree Hastings,5,"Up until now I have been a Motorola fan (Have had two versions of the Moto X), but when my last one broke, I needed to spend a bit less money. This phone is great! It is faster than my Moto (bigger RAM). The camera is not quite as high of quality, but it's not the end of the world. It's still really good compared to a lot of other ""cheaper"" smartphones (my husband's cheaper phone's camera is much lower quality)."
B078NCL7GK,claudy,5,"I love that it has soo many apps so no worries about downloading them. Soo much to do on here, never a dull moment with this phone"
B078NCL7GK,Michael Hughes,5,"I am an avid Android user now. (Used to be iOS). It's Feb 2019 and this phone is still holding up to par with other phones on the market. MIUI 8.0 is pretty legit. You don't need an expensive phone for it to be good.

I have had people ask me if this phone was the iPhoneX... With the screen off it's comparable. When the screens on. It's obvious.

4GB RAM + SD Card + Dual-Sim...

Perfect phone."
B078NCL7GK,Honest,3,"Itâs a budget phone with its price tag. I love it being light and one almost feels nothing in your hand. The reason why I didnât give more than 3 stars are that the phone doesnât support 2 sims as described. One sim supported 2g/3g/4g, great and 2nd sim only have 2g, very worst. I bought it to 2 sims. I donât expect the Face ID work likely my IPhone XsMax."
B078NCL7GK,Derrick,4,I upgraded from the 5X to the 7X. Love the speed and the ability to multitask. The addition of the equalizer is really nice with headphones. Android 8 has nice new features. The only thing I don't like is how the notification light works. It's not as responsive as the one in the 5X.
B078NCL7GK,Hec,2,"It's a good phone but I had a lot of problems with it, the GPS does not work well, it disconnects constantly, it does not read memory cards or after reading it abruptly disconnects.
Contact technical support but they did not offer me a solution"
B078NCL7GK,Kindle Customer,5,"I love this phone, functions just as good as an iPhone or Samsung. Will be buying family members one in a few weeks as gifts."
B078NCL7GK,Samuel Strauss,5,"Great phone, however if u use Android auto in cars, that doesn't always work well, but phone is fantastic in all other areas"
B078NCL7GK,Jewelz,5,"I absolutely love this phone!!!! I have had a many phones in my past, but this one is the best of them all.. Camera quality is great pictures and videos are crystal clear professional looking quality. Phone is super fast no lag and has tons of memory storage. It's been about 2 months since I have had the phone and have had no issues with it what so ever... I would definitely recommend this phone!!"
B078NCL7GK,J. Hay,3,"Maybe my favorite phone besides the original HTC One, but then came the dreaded day a couple months ago with the GPS started flaking out. I have been late for some important meetings and am now looking for a new phone."
B078NCL7GK,Joseph D.,3,"nice phone for the price, the camera is good, but the contrast is too high, maying everything look yellow, and if you lower it and restart it resets, along with 3rd party apps like ig cam the contrast is way too high."
B078NCL7GK,Heidi A.,5,"This phone has great fingerprint technology and a nice voice-to-type feature. Both work better than on the Samsung S9. The responsiveness of the screen when typing seems a tad bit slow, but otherwise, this phone is amazing."
B078NCL7GK,CW,5,"Honor 7X GSM Unlocked Smartphone 5.93â , this brand is a really nice phone. I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews decided to purchase it. I really love it and it for a few months now and no complaints"
B078NCL7GK,loveshopping,5,"I love honor phones, I started to buy from honor 5x, now I just bought this 7x, I still love it. just like people keep buying new generation iphone, i am an honor person!
Huawei! please keep up the great work and the reasonable price, then I will keep buying it."
B078NCL7GK,Chloe Birky,3,"It was a really nice quality feeling phone. I thought it ran pretty good and had a good camera, for only $200, but after a day or 2 inoticed that I wasn't getting any services for the first 15 minutes of my commute.
I do live somewhat out in the country. I haven't changed cell phone providers, and I have always gotten service with my other phones in that area,so all I can figure out is that it's the phone. My husband would have service while we were driving together, and I wouldn't have any at all. My phone would say"" no mobile service available"". I wish this phone would get better recent, because it is a nice phone."
B078NCL7GK,R. R. Escobar,4,Screen is amazing but camera is so so. I bought this for my mother and quickly became envious of the gorgeous screen and how it's just slightly faster than my Honor 6x. My mother loves how the large screen is easy for her to read and type her messages.
B078NCL7GK,Toni Brown,5,"What a great phone! Low price should not put you off. This phone compares perfectly to any other. Has all the bells and whistles. I'm still finding new things to enjoy! Amazon does it again! Buy it, you won't regret it!"
B078NCL7GK,ALOK,2,"This phone could have been great but.... the phone continues to have problem with GPS. I got the problem in first 3-4 months and I asked for replacement but honor said that it has to be sent to Dallas for fixing. I was without phone for a week.

Now again after 2 months....I have same problem....I am going to call them and see what will they do...problem is....after 1 yr warranty is over and this issue occur again...I am on my own .

It is a good phone but it people keep having pb with something or other then it is useless."
B078NCL7GK,Jessica Riley,5,"I'm holding off on giving this phone a 5 until I get more time with it, as it just arrived today. If you get blue, be aware it's a darker blue than the picture would suggest. It's more of a navy than a bright blue, but that's fine with me. I haven't tested the wifi as of yet, so I can't verify any claims about how good/bad it is. Pro's and Con's so far:

Pros:
- Contrary to some things I've been reading, we ordered two of these, one black and one blue, and both are getting 4g service through AT&T, so that hasn't been a problem for us.
- The fingerprint sensor is SUPER snappy so far, by far the fastest way to unlock the phone, and to my pleasant surprise you can register up to 5 fingers in the settings, so multiple people can be given permissions to unlock the phone with that option if you so choose, which is incredibly nice. It's also good to note that out of the box the phone has the option to toggle on and off extra functions for that sensor, which lets you answer calls, pull down the notification menu, etc., which is quite convenient.
-The phone feels well constructed, and the aluminum body makes it feel stout. It's been in my pocket (with thin rigid case and screen protector) through work and I've stopped worrying for the most part about accidentally cracking the screen. The phone is quite rigid and feels durable.
-The camera is great. There's a plethora of features built in with Huawei's software, and it's given me some amazing shots (I'll include at least one with this updated review). It'll take some experimenting to get used to, and it will also take practice to learn what works best when, but overall I'm extremely happy. It won't do 4k or anything that great, but I hardly expected it to.
-For a ""cheap"" phone the speakers are more than passable. You won't get amazing depth of sound or anything (these are phone speakers, after all) but audio is clear and loud enough for my uses.
- I've yet to get this phone under %50 battery, but I'm not a power user. It's greatest test so far as been as a GPS device for about a 4hr round trip, with the screen on about 3/4 of that time along with my normal light use. Heavy users will likely have more problems with it, but if you manage how many things you have going on in the background it's not a problem.
-I cannot complain at all about screen quality here. If anything I'm thoroughly impressed. Colors are true, lines are crisp, and it responds to touch without issue. It looks beautiful.

Cons:
-The first minor thing is that if you're ordering it for AT&T you might need to mess with some APN settings when you first set it up. It's an inconvenience but nothing serious that other phones don't also have to deal with.
-I do have one mildly irritating issue with headphone audio, which honestly is barely worth mentioning. I think it's due to the phone turning off power to audio devices to conserve battery life, but when I have headphones in (and only then), a second or two after audio is stopped there's a squeak or pop. It's the same noise you would hear plugging headphones into the headphone jack or wiggling the wire on a dying pair of headphones to get it to reconnect and play sound. It's slightly irritating, but not enough to dampen my enjoyment of this phone.
-Some will consider this a Con, but I don't mind it personally. As of now this phone is still running Android 7.0 Nougat, without an option to upgrade to the newest Oreo software. This is supposed to change, however I haven't found a solid date on when the update will roll out to this device.
- The phone does not support USB type C. This doesn't bother me in the least, but some people prefer it for various (legitimate) reasons.

Overall, this is an amazing device for the cost, and I can't recommend it enough. It doesn't help that I'm still getting a kick out of showing it to people and seeing the look of shocked disbelief on their faces when I inform them that this sleek, snappy device is a Huawei, which in my area has a reputation for being the bad end of cheap. Holding it up to a friend's Samsung Galaxy Note 8, it's nearly identical in size, and in brief comparison seemed just as high quality, and it's a surprise to people that it's not a flagship phone."
B078NCL7GK,bigfoot584,5,"Works very well impressed loaded with many programs you may need right from the start easy to operate.
I can now send text and emails on my consumer cellular plan that I could never do before with the phone
I purchased from them with my phone plan."
B078NCL7GK,jen,5,"i've been using this phone for bout 3 days n my experience so far is great. as stated in the other reviews, the performance is great; battery life is more lasting than i expected, fingerprint detection is fast, n the performance is just simply amazing as it doesnt lag that much. plus, the phone looks rlly pretty, so thts a heads up! the only concern i had when ordering was, if the camera quality was going to be nice or not. when it came n i tried it out, its actually pretty good. the camera quality is not as gud as the iPhone x , but i can work with it. overall, the phone was a steal for its price n im satisfied with this purchase."
B078NCL7GK,William Castle,5,"I did my research, looking at phone from various manufacturers and at different price points. My Wife has used this phone since Friday Oct. 3rd, she has given me her honest opinion, she loves the seamless interaction with the phone, word of advice, if you buy this phone do the system update 1st, then update the apps you want on your phone.
I would recommend this phone."
B078NCL7GK,Man,5,I love this phone knowing it's pack with features that I need (app twin...app lock....safe...) This is my 3rd honor device and won't be the last 5star all the way better than my s7 edge where security and privacy is concerned
B078NCL7GK,Kombiz Hakhamaneshy,4,"I bought this phone after a lot of searching because I had a tight budget. I don't regret buying it all! It's been less than a month that I have been using it and it has no lags, the battery life is great (I use google maps a lot and I can still use my phone for a whole day without charging it!). The picture quality is average. The phone comes with a cover instead of earphones and I found that made more sense for me! Would recommend to anyone who needs a phone under $200"
B078NCL7GK,Jack,5,Never Buy the latest and greatest. This exceeded my expectations by 10x. Destroyed my basic Samsung Jxx performance wise. I was shocked at the speed of this with large apps (Home Depot). Save $600 over a marginally faster flag ship phone. Large screen requires bigger hands.
B078NCL7GK,Reesha RP,2,The battery started giving trouble within 6 months. Its keeps cutting off but saying battery empty before and then coming on with battery at a higher percent.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"Overall, great phone. I bought for less than 200$ and for that price it is a great purchase. I would recommend this phone.

Pros:
-Good design, sleek look and appealing
- Good camera performance in good light, with a lot of control in pro photo mode
- Very good battery life
- Solid processing and multitasking
- Large display with nice color

Cons:
- Screen glare in the sunlight. Honestly, this is quite annoying since the screen is not nearly as clear while in the sun light."
B078NCL7GK,Kay,5,This phone is for my tech savvy husband. It has all the bells and whistles of the newer Android phones you can buy with none of the bloatware. The phone is expandable by adding an internal memory card that you can't beat. He is very happy with his phone and we are now a Huawei family! Delivered fast and on time.
B078NCL7GK,world traveller,5,"Great device - so far has service in the rural midwest, boston, california, Cost Rica, Mexico - will test Thailand next week."
B078NCL7GK,Sam,2,"Highly recommended
Update: I'm facing many system problems recently!! No one is answering me from the customer service!!"
B078NCL7GK,Paulus (Robert),2,"Sad sad...but the screen shatters...and took me a day to find one in Singapore. Still not arrived owned for 3 months!
Not user friendly...touch the contacts screen and its ringing! Try to end a call and one is opening and closing everything to switch off..Only a small green band on the top which does not open ...my calls often are 20 seconds longer! Camera hopeless...cannot change the picture size! Alarm is hard to set...and has let me down 3x! Sad as I say but maybe off to a bad start."
B078NCL7GK,Art,4,"Looks great. Case is a nice little extra. Has issues with some notifications, even after poring through and properly setting up the whitelist. Lag issues went away after updating to latest version of Android."
B078NCL7GK,Lukas Wagner,5,"Well for the price it's really solid. The only complaint I have is the fingerprint scanner works like 4/10 times I scan my finger. It kinda sucks nuts but doesn't degrade the phone much. Camera is really solid, software is up to date, and it's just snappy in general. If you're looking for a high end phone this cheap, this is the closest you can come."
B078NCL7GK,Amodeus1971,5,I truly think this brand makes some of the best phones for the buck. This phone is missing quick charge and USB C compared to my old phone but with the battery life I really don't notice it. I never used any other of the C options.
B078NCL7GK,tdtdtd,1,"This phone is a decent phone. I've had it for a year now. The only real problem I have is the GPS does not work at all. It never catches a signal so anything GPS oriented is useless, cannot use Google maps at all. I have researched this and I am not the only one with this problem. If you don't need a GPS, then this phone is good for you."
B078NCL7GK,Customer!,5,A pretty great phone the battery life is great and the screen texture is smooth I have dropped this phone a few times and with the clear case you get with it not a single dent not a single scratch its just a great phone all around
B078NCL7GK,Charley Chen,5,"Amazed that this phone is just 200 unlocked. Not a shill, just thinking about all the money I wanted on iphones in the past several years."
B078NCL7GK,RB - Seattle,5,"I had a couple other competitors. This is the best phone I've owned. Took a trip to India, wanted a good camera, best camera on a phone I've ever used. Got some amazing shots.

Phone's now updated Android 8. Perfection would be 64gb or 128, but with a microsd card this is a great phone"
B078NCL7GK,Larry C.,4,For the money I think you would be hard pressed to find a better phone with more features than this. I bought this for my 13 year old son and he loves it. Does everything you would expect a modern smart phone to do at an affordable price.....highly recommend!!
B078NCL7GK,kemar bell,4,For the price the specs is too good to be true I bought this for my friend I was amazed by what this phone can do for the price it is it almost has the same specs as my Note 8 the camera is great the user interface is great for the price yeah.
B078NCL7GK,kevin quintero,5,"This phone has been behaving very good, temps are reasonable(even though i have a big case), battery lasts me about 19-25 hrs depends on the use ( i always have apps running in background).
just in case you want to know Works fine with AT&T and Cricket.

overall feels premium.

looks 9/10
screen and colors 8/10
camera 7/10
battery 9/10
temps 9/10 without case, 8/10 with case

Update: 5 months with the phone and still 5 stars"
B078NCL7GK,Sibusk,5,"This is a very good quality phone that compares to the latest phones for a fraction of the price. It takes super clear pictures, better then my iPhone 6 did. It also has a good amount of internal storage that an be upgraded with a micro sd card."
B078NCL7GK,Ashford256,5,Fantastic smartphone
B078NCL7GK,Melody,5,The best phone I have ever had. Love it!
B078NCL7GK,Kitty Sky,3,"4 months in and the back light is out for the screen,rendering it useless"
B078NCL7GK,Kindle Customer,3,This phone is good for the price. Screen touch needs to be improved. Only allows a single press at a time. Sound is OK not great. Network and WiFi connection is not the greatest. Don't rely on VoIP type calls because of the constant reconnection.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"It has lots of excellent features and well built. Good size in the hand and light enough. However I prefer a better screen ( a bit washed out, especially in day light), fast charging, wireless charging)."
B078NCL7GK,Matthew Billingsley,5,"The Honor 7X surpasses all expectations I had when purchasing. The phone is sturdy, has an amazing battery (I've had it last 2 days on single charge with regular use), the camera is far better than I expected, and it has plenty of space plus expandable by micro SD. My only complaint with this phone is that it has mircro USB instead of type-C so there is no quick charge and in fact the phone takes a little over 2 hours to charge. Even still this phone has been one of the best phones I've owned and I prefer even to some flagships."
B078NCL7GK,Richard Oh,4,"I bought the7X in March 2018. My first smart phone. So far no mechanical problems. The phone is well worth the money and I am overall satisfied with it. However, I find the manual information quite incomplete.

When I ""dial"" a 10-digit telephone #(USA), it connects; but some numbers require additional numbers/letters/password in order to route your call to the complete the call.
Does anyone know how to do this? I could not find anything about this in the user's manual.
RIchard"
B078NCL7GK,Tone,5,For now on I will not pay $1000.00 for another phone. This phone has proven to me that you can have a great phone for less.
B078NCL7GK,Wendi,5,This is great. I think just as good as my wife's new Samsung 7S. Only thing I noticed is that it doesn't have 5G wifi.
B078NCL7GK,Tora Belu,5,Really loved this phone 5 star
B078NCL7GK,Tanaya Sakura Meow,5,I didn't know what to expect with this phone. The bad reviews truly don't do this phone any justice. I've been using this phone for about 2-3 months now and it's been great. The camera quality is surprisingly beautiful. My instagram pictures have been elevated ever since I got this phone. The fingerprint unlock feature has made me lazy with its convenience.
B078NCL7GK,faygo19,5,Amazing phone for the price. If you want an iPhone quality camera you won't get that. But this thing does everything else better and the battery life destroys my wife iPhone 8.
B078NCL7GK,Brian Ellis,5,"I love it. Does everything as advertised if not better and It didn't take 30 months to pay for it or require financing. Beautiful screen resolution, long batter life, and it was easy to transfer data from my old phone to this new one with an app."
B078NCL7GK,KS,5,"Excellent mid range phone for the great price.

It's well built, and has solid feeling no less than that of Mate 9 that I currently own. Only negatives that I can think of are the lack of NFC, slight more lags for switching applications (when compared with Mate 9), and narrower screen dimension that is relatively new to android devices.

It supports LTE FDD band 17 (and several other bands), so it should work with AT&T, and NVMO using AT&T network like cricket mobile that I use.

I feel that smart phones are quickly commoditized, and it's getting very hard to justify paying for the price the flagship phones ask these days. So this phone is a godsend for me."
B078NCL7GK,miii,2,"Based on reviews, I expected a good phone. At first it was, once I did a factory reset. Camera is okay, good considering the price range. The phone itself, not so much. Apps don't work properly, seems like they aren't compatible with software. In fact, apps that I had transferred from my old phone that were working fine were incompatible with the honor 7x, affecting the whole operation of this phone. So right after the initial setup I had to do a factory reset, upsetting but the phone was good to go. Then the problems started. Slow. Laggy. Freezing. Shutting down randomly. Kept having to restart which was very frustrating, couldn't even use the phone for a half hour sometimes.

I honestly don't understand the rave reviews about the honor 7x! I am not a gamer or a heavy user. Calls, texts, light user of social media and camera - that's it. And this phone could not even handle that!"
B078NCL7GK,Bevon Burke,5,"This phone is quick with loading apps, the Selfie camera is awesome, the other cameras take OK photos, with the panoramic picture mode making best use of those cameras. The build quality is study, it has fallen quite a few times, no scratches or broken screen. There is a wide array of cases that keep the phone sleek even with the case on.
For its price, this phone is a worthy buy."
B078NCL7GK,Paty Nsumbu,5,A great smartphone!
B078NCL7GK,Tom Millard,5,Love the phone! I'm typing this review on the phone right now. I was not sure if I should upgrade this from the s6 edge I had the international 64gb version. This phone is a lot better because my s6vwas getting old. The case that comes with the phone ruins the look and makes it look really cheap. Ranyi makes a great case for this phone that is 9.99 and I highly recommend it as it makes the whole phone look absolutely amazing.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"Great phone, so my experience with phones has been around the budget area since I previously owned a Asus Zenphone 2 and a Samsung galaxy mini. So what you want to know are the Cons of the phone since everyone else has already explained all the Pros. However one thing that did shock me was how good the fingerprint reader was 10/10 so fast. So onto Cons.

Cons- VIBRATION SUCKS, like damn this motor is weak af, good thing the sound is loud enough
Lot of bloat with the phone
Camera is fine not great not bad
Heavy skin of Emui but its not too in your face
(Micro usb is maybe a con for some but I have a ton of old cables so its nice not having to buy new ones)

Overall my second $200 dollar phone and compared to the zenphone out of the box, its not anything to blow your mind performance wise but right away it feels and looks SO much more premium alike something that would cost $500 bucks. If your looking into this phone right now I definitely recommend getting it if your budget is similar to mine or if you need a cheap phone. Oh and i'm on T-mobile and it seems to work fine."
B078NCL7GK,Bri,5,Absolutely recommend this phone to anyone that will listen. We've bought these for family and enjoy them more than the $600 phones we got suckered into by our carrier
B078NCL7GK,Elton Velasco,5,"this phone is excellent, it's beyond for how much i paid. Great feeling holding it and having, love the design, the way it holds the software and everything basically. The camera is good but not the best, but it's fine for how much i paid. Best budget phone out there.

HERE'S AN UNBOXING VIDEO OF THE PHONE:

B078NCL7GK,Pearson,5,"This is a great phone for the price. Big screen, decent battery life. No real documentation on how to use, but my kids gave me a thorough tutorial."
B078NCL7GK,garyw,2,"I really liked the look and feel of the phone. It was very fast for about two weeks but then the screen started freezing. I would have to push the power button to get to my home screen and then start again on the webpage I was looking for. I thought it might have been my wifi but No, it happened with mobile data as well as other wifis. It may just have been this phone but I didn't want to take a chance so I asked for a refund."
B078NCL7GK,C,5,"Best money I have ever spent on a phone. My girlfriend is jealous now because she's still paying on her iphone, and this does pretty much everything it does for waaayyy cheaper."
B078NCL7GK,Kaito,1,"Amazing out of the box but with major flaws. The camera is great, though slow to load. The screen is beautiful and gigantic. I really wanted to love this phone but it's major flaw is with the simplest features. Apparently they used one antenna for both bluetooth and wifi so neither works well and even worse when they are both being used. I expected to give up some features with a price point at 200 but the amount of issues I've had connecting bluetooth devices is absurd. I've paired and re-paired my garmin watch more times than I can count. Not having my work truck recognize my phone basically makes this phone useless to me. Some days it finds my bluetooth speakers some days it can't. Great phone as long as you don't plan on using bluetooth."
B078NCL7GK,Thomas M.,5,The best phone ever built on a budget. Don't waste money on flagships until you try this phone.
B078NCL7GK,Benn,4,"First why border spend 1000 on a phone.
this 200 dollar phone almost do the same .
I can said you dont feel a big different .
I have.iphone 7 plus. dont feel big different.
only.the price....

i vote 4 because can not change battery.
I like the big screen.
and phone run smoothly with game.
long battery."
B078NCL7GK,Loving Father,4,A good inexpensive phone. It's a pity you have to choose between the second Sim and a memory card but for me the 32gig storage is fine so I use the 2 Sim cards. It has its quirks like any other phone but so far they have been minor. I like it.
B078NCL7GK,Reydi B.,5,"I bought this phone and it has so many good functions! first of all you can use fingerprint to unlock or you can choose to have face unlock. it comes with the latest security patches and updates, not hard to use and it's camera is a top-notch camera with so many good functions as slow-mo, a great bokeh effect and much more. the Honor team did a great job here and people like it so much, i bought 2 more for my friends."
B078NCL7GK,M. Davis,5,"Best $200 Android phone out there. Not going to outperform my OnePlus 5T, but it is everything a non-power-user could want. Camera is pretty meh, but that is par for the course in this price range."
B078NCL7GK,Julie Miller,5,"A awesome phone for cheap. It's fast, fingerprint reader beats the Pixel 2, no noticeable difference in performance from the galaxy 8. You will not be sorry unless you get a lemon."
B078NCL7GK,Taylor,4,"The sent me the wrong color phone! But whatever! Excellent phone! Runs smooth. Fantastic photos. Runs games, apps and emulators smoothly. Lots of storage space.
Call quality leaves something to be desired, in terms of volume and carity but it's far from awful. Phones speaker is not going to WOW you but it's servicable. This is a budget phone after all. OS has no guest mode. Battery life is not as great as most phones and charging is slow.
Phone looks and feels wonderful. Sharp wide pictures look great."
B078NCL7GK,Jose d.,5,"For the price there are few cellphones with the amount of features this phone has, the screen is particularly nice as it covers much of the phone, on the back it looks like an Ipod, that may be a good or bad thing depending on the person, it has a real dual camera setup that's good, but not great as there are plenty phones that take better pictures but this one cost a fraction of those

In summary this is a great phone specially considering the price and features it has, there is more good than bad

Pros:
* The Screen with the new Screen Ratio so popular in flagship phones
* The Price
* There is a clear rubber case included in the Phone
* The software has alot of options and it feels quick
* Dual Cameras are good but not flagship good
* Good Battery Life
* Metal Body
Cons
* No NFC
* 5 Ghz Wifi
* No Fast Charging"
B078NCL7GK,Jrogjr,5,For the money you can't beat it. Just buy it
B078NCL7GK,William M.,3,Looks great works better than expected but it can't access the cell service I use at&t or FreedomPop or others I checked will keep it for sort of tablet. Also hope to travel out of country.
B078NCL7GK,khoa do,5,"Great phone for the price. I've used the Honor 5x and this is a nice upgrade wile being basically the same price. It's quick, responsive with decent battery life. Honestly, the only thing that would put people off is the UI but it's not difficult to get used to."
B078NCL7GK,Alex K,5,"I really like this phone overall, it's fast and easy to use. I thought the camera would be a bit better, but my expectations are pretty high, so don't let that deter you. It's a good value phone."
B078NCL7GK,Donna,5,2nd purchase love it. My son is now using the old one.
B078NCL7GK,Just Me,4,"Pretty good, haven't had it long. Pictures are decent but not the best. Good value for the price compared to other smartphones."
B078NCL7GK,BKAZ,5,"Had about a month now. Batttery is still great, phone is working flawlessly. Really enjoying this thing. Well worth the price."
B078NCL7GK,Jim Bridger,4,Seems like a pretty decent phone so far. Fingerprint reader is cool even though it usually takes multiple tries. I wish the power button was above the volume buttons. Battery life is good. Camera is good.
B078NCL7GK,Don,5,For the price you get more than ur money worth. I got this for the frequency to work with one of my carriers. It's even better than I expected it can't reach to my LG G6 but I will keep this one
B078NCL7GK,Jagdish,5,"I bought this phone for my brother and he doesn't wanted to spent too much money so I was looking for something in our budget. I am very glad that I took right decision to buy this phone; solid material, easy to hold, great picture quality, video conference quality is perfect (duo, WhatsApp, fb messenger). The phone satisfies customer from all aspect."
B078NCL7GK,Justin schwanger,5,I honor phones there nice and make it through a day and love the big 6in screen great for games or YouTube plenty of storage and itâs a great plus if your in a budget this is for u
B078NCL7GK,Andre R.,5,"Flagship Killer, plain and simple!"
B078NCL7GK,Coop,5,"Been awaiting delivery of the Honor 7x for a couple weeks now. Just for comparison sake, I owned a OnePlus 3T prior to picking up this phone. The OnePlus was slowing down quite a bit, so I sold it and took a portion of the proceeds and gave the Honor 7x a try. I owned the Honor 5x a few years ago, and had a decent experience with it.

Like I said, so far, so great. I'm only 6 hours into the experience, but I can say that this is one impressive phone for the price. I did quite a bit of homework before purchasing and was between a few devices, but this was the only one under $300 that I was considering. The screen ratio is one of the best aspects of the phone. The build is solid and the software layer is pretty usable. I haven't yet needed to go to Nova. If you put this in front of anyone with a bit of knowledge about the landscape of phones out there, I would bet they would guess that this phone is priced between $300-$400.

Will update after a week of use. Don't hesitate...buy, buy, buy!"
B078NCL7GK,Larry Lowe,4,"The Honor 7 does most things well. Two problems: I experience significant lag time in response if I forget to swipe apps closed after use. Just keep the RAM clear and things seem to respond well. Also, there are dropouts in the signal when I use the Bluetooth connection to my car's stereo, more dropouts than usual with this car and my old phone. Also, if you want near field communication, this phone doesn't have it. Battery life is great."
B078NCL7GK,Judy G. Harber,5,Great phone. Great price. Very fast. Easy to use. Except I canât use google pay on it...or at least canât figure out how to get it to work. Very happy with the phone
B078NCL7GK,MamaBear,5,"Have had galaxies for years, decided to try this because it was so much more cost effective. Fabulous phone is every bit as good as my galaxies, photos are better, very easy to use, great quality at a very small price."
B078NCL7GK,John B,5,I couldn't be happier with the product. Actually I could if it had NFC and Wifi 5ghz but for the price is for sure the best quality phone you can get !! Go for it !!
B078NCL7GK,ava,5,"so far so good, nothing less than my Samsung cellphone. to be honest, it could have a better camera but i already saved enough to get a dslr by going with this over Samsung , so no complain. great lcd, very beautiful design, good battery life , and the finger print password works awesome.way faster than my previous devices."
B078NCL7GK,Bobblefrog,5,"**Edit**
Recommend going through Honor chat support to get ticket if needed (don't leave message on unattended chat - won't be answered). Turns out hotspot issue was operator error - I used a hotspot name my computer ""remembered"" so it wouldn't prompt for a password. Once I renamed it, it was fine. However if it had been the phone other than clearing cache, it would have required a reset - or maybe repair.

I think phone on ""automatic"" makes some pictures outside a little bright and tinny feeling right out of the box. That feels a little unfortunate. I'll update after I have tested more. At least this phone offers some basic settings to play with. The portrait mode doesn't always give me the bokeh effect. Again, more testing needed. I wasn't expecting professional but for novice was hoping for a little better point and shoot good results.

**Original**
So far, putting it through it's paces, I'm really happy. But I'm stepping up from $100 phones, with the last one still being on Android 5.5, so any comparison is relative. I had a great experience with Ting, including a free sim card when I asked them some presale questions, and the phone activated without any issues.

A clear flexible case for the back does come with it which was a bonus. The blue is a pretty color, wouldn't want to cover it up. Missed having gorilla glass from my Moto G a couple years back. So, pleased it is one of the phone features. Overall it's not too bulky for its size, retains the earbud plugin port, has a nice clear display, seems responsive and I liked the pictures I've taken so far. Nice options all the way around in this Android version 8.0 Oreo. Fast charging seems to work as expected with the included cord. Fingerprint scanner works great. Calls were clear both ways.

Have had a few glitches worth mentioning:
- does not support wifi calling (Ting does, so it's the phone)
- when I set it up as a hotspot, even though I created password and the icon on other devices saw it as locked - they were not challenged with a password request (have sent a message to support, so we'll see). workaround is to manually allow devices.

I'll come back and edit if I have any further problems, or get an answer to the hotspot issue."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Everything is exceptionally good except the camera, which is still good enough for me since I don't take a lot of photos.

Update: It's been a few months and I still have no objections with this phone other than the camera, but I had worse before."
B078NCL7GK,Michael G,1,Item freeze all the time drop Bluetooth and you have to reboot to reconnect again
B078NCL7GK,Sierra,4,"I bought this unlocked phone because I saw It on straight talks list of compatible phones. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE. Now I have to return the phone, case and protection plan! Very disappointed..."
B078NCL7GK,Martin P,5,"Very good phone, purchased it for using it as a daily carry, has good battery life, the screen looks nice, software is runs smooth and although of course it does not have the best camera in the world it is still very usable, overall a very solid and practical phone specially for its price tag."
B078NCL7GK,Anna,5,I loved the Honor 6X and only upgraded to the 7X because it was cheaper to buy this one than the 6X with an Amazon deal and at first I thought the screen was almost too big for comfort but once I got a good case that had a ring buckle on it for support that wasnât an issue anymore. Still better than an iPhone.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,The best budget phone of 2018. Fingerprint sensor is stellar and works perfect except when hands are wet. Does a great job in sunlight and the battery life is the best I've experienced so far.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought this phone after apple slowed their phones, I had an iphone before and when I looked for phones, I found this phone to be a perfect match for iphone S. My niece had previously bought this phone and she loves it so I decided to give it a try. Very nice camera, good size.... and the speed it loads is amazing. Absolutely worth it!"
B078NCL7GK,Jade,5,After trying apple and windows phone I have found this phone. I love it! It does everything I need but at a fraction of the price of an apple phone.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Buy it. You honestly will not regret it. Though, its not on Android 8 or 9 (whatever the lastest is). It runs on 7 and works, in my opinion, faster than an iPhone 6s and/or 7. Very good phone for the price"
B078NCL7GK,Hannah,2,"It seemed like a pretty decent phone in the first day. Day two, the fingerprint scanner just stopped working. I've returned it before anything else breaks ."
B078NCL7GK,Oneluckyguy,3,For the price its a nice phone but the GPS is terrible. Playing Pokiemon go you cannot stay near gyms long enough to battle or raid. However it gives zero GPS drift credit.
B078NCL7GK,Aaron Hudspeth,5,"Huge screen and very responsive fingerprint reader! I don't miss the exclusion of 5GHz WiFi or USB-C, because I don't have a compatible router or any USB-C cables or other devices anyways. For $200, there is no better value. Some people dislike EMUI, but I find it quite nice. Coming from a Moto G3, I do miss the motion-based gestures, but not worth docking any stars for."
B078NCL7GK,Paul T,5,My second Huawei phone. My first was the Mate II. The Mate II was great. The Honor 7x is even better. No other phone offers the same quality features without charging twice the price!!! I won't go back to American brands unless they get more competitive!
B078NCL7GK,Sarem Ayub,4,"This phone is really good for the price. When you look at a phone around this price range you don't expect much but honor gives you a lot more. This phone feels like its $600-$700 just on build quality. The photos are hit and miss. Night photos are terrible. During the day you can get some really good pictures! The sound is what you expect from a $200 phone. It's best you use headohones. All over if your new Android or need a budget phone, this is the one!"
B078NCL7GK,Daniel Jozwik,5,Bought this for my mom. She mostly browses articles and talks to family in Australia with viber app. Great phone. My mom has no complaints with it.
B078NCL7GK,Daniel Torres,5,"Wow this phone exceeded my expectations! Previously I had a Samsung Note 5 and I can't believe how fast and smooth this Honor 7x is, I don't see any difference at all and Honor 7x has even more features! Finally for a quarter of the price, EVEN BETTER!!"
B078NCL7GK,F. Wang,4,"had some calling issues but turned out to be the recieving phone.

hardware feels good in hand. seems responsive. big screen that doesnt feel so big in pocket."
B078NCL7GK,P. Buchanan,5,"We now own 3. Incredible little phone for the price - the photos are great, the screen is super bright and colorful, everyone loves it."
B078NCL7GK,Eli,5,"This phone isn't a bad phone at all compared to the price. Latest software, fast, and sharp. Front camera quality can be better but you are able to customize the picture appearance to make it look great"
B078NCL7GK,Stanislava Ivanova,5,"I am very happy with this phone overall.
One thing to keep in mind, if you are a Snapchat fiend - the app will periodically freeze up really bad on this phone to the point where the phone has to be restarted, if you keep it running - so i recommend closing the app out every time after you use it."
B078NCL7GK,Buyer of random things,5,So fast! And so much customizability in the settings! I like it much more than my old iPhone. Of course I'm slightly worried about the Huawei spying issue. But isn't that like every phone these days...
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,This phone is not bad for the price But slowly I got problems
B078NCL7GK,Michael Badette,5,Best budget phone ever
B078NCL7GK,Marjorie,5,Best phone I've ever had! I'm 74 years old and found it very easy to use. It has everything I need and more. Especially love the long charge!!! No regrets!
B078NCL7GK,change,4,I loved my honor 5x so i thought ok ill try this phone what i'm disappointed in is the notification light its a big deal to me because i sometimes have my phone turned all the way down and i have come to expect to see a notification come in by just looking at the light pulsating but the light on this phone is so faint and the blue is hard to see and in comparison.. i think my honor 5x was faster if you can believe that..anyway i maybe returning this phone and not sure if ill be sticking with this brand ...my honor 5x is still working by the way for almost two yrs now.. I bought this thinking i would get an awesome phone and it is in some ways... but ((((NOTIFICATION LIGHT IS HARD TO SEE)))). i also bought this phone thinking encase my honor 5x dies ..
B078NCL7GK,Phil C,4,"Good camera, screen is bright, fast ,no complain but why only 2G on the second Sim."
B078NCL7GK,jim bob,4,"Amazing value, just doesn't work on Verizon networks"
B078NCL7GK,cinest,5,"It is very elegant, easy to use, no bloatware. It is light and with a huge screen. Fingerprint scanner works like a charm. All in all, works for me."
B078NCL7GK,A. Kirsch,5,2nd one I have owned. Battery lasts for 5 days with location turned off. 2 days with location turned on. Better than any other android phone I have owned (Motorola and Samsung).
B078NCL7GK,Sylvio da Cunha,5,"I am not that crazy about fancy smartphones and this device is just perfect for me. As a matter of fact, this is my second Honor. I used to have the Honor 5 before. Go for it!"
B078NCL7GK,dt,5,"Great phone, great value. Metal case and build quality is top notch, great hardware specs, super fast, great camera, awesome price, can't think of anything to complain about."
B078NCL7GK,R. Bethke,4,I liked the price point and power the phone offered. It seems sturdier than it's predecessor but I'd still recommend a case for it just in case
B078NCL7GK,Mike Reitano,1,"after using the phone for more than 2 months, I found that everytime I change the themes, the new themes messed up my contact list, it just wiped out all phone numbers eventhough the name of all contacts still there but numbers were all gone, I had to re-loaded them again from my back up and then deleted all the duplicates that was sooooo frustrated, that forced me not to change my themes again because it was absolutely horrible to have to fix your contact list especially if you have a long list...another thing is once in a while the phone was not responding at all even right after reset, imagine youre doing something important and all of the sudden the phone stop working that need to reset again all your works are gone, it was such a big waste of time. will never purchase Huewei/honor again, don't buy this product it's not worth your time and $."
B078NCL7GK,Domingo,5,The color of the screen is bright and nice. The only bad is that it does not include fast charging. but the battery is great last long hours.
B078NCL7GK,DC Bike RIder,5,"Easy set up, intuitive. Useful features: you can set up schedule for the display to minimize ""blue light"" effect, and brightness can auto- adjust. Easy on the eyes, and lots of text- adjustments for reading. Pleasantly surprised by this phone."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"It's cheap and good but the only place it lacks is on the camera, pictures come good just that colors look weird sometimes depending on the light."
B078NCL7GK,Stace Face,5,"Great phone. Fast, beautiful, functional. Really good mid tier phone for entry level price. Nice big screen, fingerprint sensor, extra storage. Good buy. Forget the name brand and save $$$ on a comparable product."
B078NCL7GK,Raquel da Cunha,5,"This phone is really good. Battery is amazing, 3300 mia lasts over a day. The camera is not the greatest but still pretty decent. The processor is also really good. For the price, this phone is a bargain."
B078NCL7GK,skyworld,5,great phone with lots of features for a good price
B078NCL7GK,Juan C Alonso,5,Works and looks great. Just what I expected.
B078NCL7GK,Mauro Neaus,5,"What more is there to say? I have 0 hangups about this phone, it is the best one I have ever gotten, and at that price?! Wooo wee. I bought this when it was on sale for $169, btw."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,I switched from Apple and I will never look back. The 7x works great day in and day out. after letting a few people see what it could do it blew them away that it was priced at $200.
B078NCL7GK,vanessa,5,"honors are the s*** best phones out there in my opinion, seriously better than any iphone"
B078NCL7GK,Waleeka Willis,5,"This is truly a great phone, I love everything about it so far and have no complaints!"
B078NCL7GK,K. T.,5,"Item just as described, plus more un-mentioned useful features - such as a Mirror app and Speech to Text messaging feature - among my favorite, most useful features. Room for improvement - No suggestions are shown when entering recipients for new messages. But on a whole, overwhelming 5 stars."
B078NCL7GK,Opinion,4,"If not looking for super fast and powerful phone, and just need a phone with good battery to watch videos, this phone is perfect."
B078NCL7GK,Sniper,5,"I bought this phone for a friend, she likes it very much, the speed is very fast, and the screen quality is also very good. Thank you Amazon."
B078NCL7GK,H3110,5,"I really love it.

Pros
It's fast,
Gorgouse screen
Long battery life. It lasts me the entire day

Cons
Does not have a picture stabilizer"
B078NCL7GK,J Owens,2,I really loved this phone for the first few weeks but it has gradually become more and more of a pain. It is slow/jerky at times and I have to restart it multiple times a day in order to get it to work for a few hours. Would not purchase again.
B078NCL7GK,DLTK,5,I must have looked at mid-priced phones for 6 months and wasn't really happy with any until I found this one. I'm convinced that this is the deal at least of the decade!
B078NCL7GK,Jesse813,2,"It's ok for the price, just keep in mind that there will be some lag as this doesn't have a snappy processor. If you don't mind that, then this is a great phone. Good camera and built quality."
B078NCL7GK,Jason C Ricketts,5,"I like everything about this phone. I've had it for awhile now. I've been converted from Samsung, this phone is superior in every way compared to my like priced Samsung phones."
B078NCL7GK,paul datcuk,5,"Very happy with product, so far. Nice looking, comfortable to hold. It is a bit heavy but that was expected. Can't comment on anything technical since I'm not a techie. Was just looking for something a little larger with nice features."
B078NCL7GK,M Shack,5,"Usually get top of the line phones. Got rid of my LG v30 after getting this phone. The battery life is amazing, lasts over 2 days."
B078NCL7GK,J B,5,"This smartphone meets my needs. It is economical to purchase, takes good photos, and plays clear sound. I couldn't be happier!"
B078NCL7GK,Jake Sully,5,Really wonderful phone. I upgraded from the Honor 5x and am really pleased with both phones. One thing I've noticed about the Honor phones is that they are pretty durable. The user interface is also intuitive and easy to set up. The camera is exceptionally good. The professional mode works well and I can even take long-exposure twilight shots. Overall very pleased with these phones.
B078NCL7GK,Izzy,5,"Very responsive, camera quality is ok and has a very responsive finger print unlock. very good for the cost"
B078NCL7GK,Alvin Satney,5,do not break the screen. trouble to get a good replacement. zippy. beautiful screen. camera is good. for the price it is a very good phone.
B078NCL7GK,Chiaroscuro,5,Loving it. Great camera.
B078NCL7GK,Amazonian,5,I really enjoy these phones. I had the 6x until I dropped it down a flight of stairs. It is nice to not panic about the cost of a phone when life happens and it breaks.
B078NCL7GK,Eduardo S.,5,"the best option I could take when selecting this phone. i'm from Venezuelan and use Movistar and this phone it works perfectly in 4G LTE Bands (1700/2100).

The screen resolution is excellent, the camera resolution is very great, take a good picture.

this phone arrive with Android Nougat but instantly you can update to Andoid Oreo.

really really recomended"
B078NCL7GK,zzzrn,5,This phone is huge! It takes the best pictures I have ever seen. A million times better than my Samsung A billion times better than the iPhone.
B078NCL7GK,Matt,5,"Bought this for my wife as a replacement to her Nexus LG 5. She enjoys it very much. Food screen response, looks sharp and has a great battery life."
B078NCL7GK,Fanual Dawit,3,"It's great phone for the price, but the GPS is terrible. It's frustrating it barley works other than that it is great phone."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,"this phone i thought at first was new and amazing but it immediately started messing up.. the service wouldnt pick up as good as my phone before in the same areas. it would drop calls, speaker messed up and eventually screen wore out. i only had phone 2 and half months."
B078NCL7GK,Ish,5,"Excellent phone. I have been using it close to two months and everything is running well. It is fast, the camera is good and the battery life is great, So far I am very happy and satisfied with the phone."
B078NCL7GK,D Whitlock,4,"I have only had this a short time but so far, it seems like a quality product. I was going from a very old slide phone to this one. It has been much easier to setup than I thought it would be. Still getting used to it but I think I'm going to like it a lot!"
B078NCL7GK,Em Morris,5,"My MotoG 4th edition wouldn't charge, so I ordered this phone as a replacement. Turns out my MotoG started charging again (must have been a moisture problem)...but by that point I was in love with the Honor 7x - its thinner, faster, and the camera is a lot easier to use. I'm a convert who loves the 7X....."
B078NCL7GK,Christian Betancourt,5,"Good quality for the price, i sent this to my mother overseas and she hasn't gotten any issues since then."
B078NCL7GK,Eliza Houghton,4,"Processing is a little bit slower than most smartphones, and you have to close down most other apps to use the camera. That said, the phone works great, has a good amount of memory, and is sleek and modern looking. Battery life is excellent, and the screen resolution and picture quality are great. An amazing deal for the price."
B078NCL7GK,Irene rivera,5,I honestly don't have a con for this. The camera on this phone is great. Pic quality is sweet. Sound is also great. Easy to set up. I have family mobile/T-Mobile and it works great.
B078NCL7GK,venkataraman,5,Very good value for money. Has the lastest features and is 4 times faster than iphone
B078NCL7GK,bennywang,4,"it works great, it is for an older people, which is more than enough. camera takes great pictures but too many apps that come with the phone which take a bite out of the memory."
B078NCL7GK,Mr Fort,5,"I definitely recommend this phone. It's easy to use, and works pretty well for me.
Very easy to connect with my company (metro pcs). I don't have any problem using the Bluetooth or the
Hot Spot."
B078NCL7GK,Francisco durango uribe,5,"Been using it as my main phone, work great. Have the Android 8 via EMUI. That provides some cool features such as screen recording with out external app and nice gestures for use. The camera is great to capture nice pictures and provides some filters and extras for long exposure photos."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,3,"I value reviews on products I intend to purchase. Typically, I don't do reviews but I felt obligated to do so on this phone. I consider myself to be tech savvy but not a tech snob when it comes to phones. That being said, I know what I'm looking for in a phone and I thought this phone had it. I had been patiently waiting on the Honor View 10 to come out (guess I should've waited a tad bit longer) but decided to bite the bullet and just buy this phone until its release.

THE GOOD:
Beautiful phone- solid build. Love the aluminum body and how it feels in the hand. Love the skins and themes you can download to customize the phone. Transferring all of my apps / accounts / etc from my previous phone was a breeze and only took about an hour or so.

THE BAD:
I'm coming from a ZTE Axon Mini 7 which has given me hell with performance issues. Watch Netflix on the Axon 7 Mini is a lot crisper than this phone (sure it has something to do with LCD vs AMOLED).

THE UGLY:
RAM RAM RAM! Imagine my heartbreak when this phone started to lag not even a week after owning it. Imagine my frustration when I realized there was a Mate SE model with more RAM that was available for $30 more.

Needless to say I am in the process of returning the Honor 7X and purchasing the Mate SE. Totally worth the money in my opinion."
B078NCL7GK,Justin Ward,5,Amazing phone for the price. Best budget phone out there for the price in my opinion. Compatible to most top flagship phones.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,This phone is an excellent budget buy. Only difference I've noticed between this and $700 competors is the Bluetooth isn't as reliable but still functions good enough.
B078NCL7GK,Kathy-Ann Thomas,5,I purchase this phone last month for my husband after reading customers reviews and I must say my husband is really enjoying this phone. He love taking photos and the quality is really nice. The screen size is amazing. Overall he is really pleased with my purchase.
B078NCL7GK,JPMar,5,This cellphone looks and works very well. Screen resolution is good and its camera takes nice and clear photos.
B078NCL7GK,Balasor,5,"Something you should know, some carriers,like boost Mobile will not except this brand. T Mobile does and is my carrier. That aside a great phone for the money"
B078NCL7GK,brian burchett,5,"Couldn't be happier! This phone is the best bang for your buck. Amazing picture quality, super fast when using apps plus it looks great. Thank you!"
B078NCL7GK,XL,4,Its camera can take very good pictures. The calling and SMS function works very well. The sound quality is not bad. A very good choice for a $150 Android phone.
B078NCL7GK,Justin,4,Great phone! Bright and big display! Only draw back is you can't have a different notification for the email and text notifiers.
B078NCL7GK,Landysh,4,"Very pleased with the purchase. Nice phone, the siftwear works pretty well, camera is great, battery holds long. The only concern is the speaker but doesn't really bother."
B078NCL7GK,Edward,5,"Very cool phone at this price, has to be one of the best unlocked phones you can buy at this price point."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,"The GPS chip is malfunctioning apparently Honor 7x company made a bad deal by installing cheap and bad quality GPS unit in to this phone... An advice :if you using google or other maps application frequently, This is not the phone to buy, it won't be long time before you get disappointed..."
B078NCL7GK,linda h.,5,DON'T LIKE THE ADDS OTHER PHONE IS OPERATING BETTER THAN MY OTHER PHONE DID. PLEASED WITH THE PHONE.
B078NCL7GK,Alexis Feliciano,3,"Device screen ratio is amazing for the price! I had to return it due to lag and some freezing issues. For those u who can take patience and wait for app to come pass the freezing point.

Camera was an issues, it was often getting camera blur, this is no go for me."
B078NCL7GK,Cathy,5,"So far I love it, I've had it a few weeks and it works perfectly. I just wish it had themes like previous honor models, but that isn't even an issue. I suppose the camera app can be a bit slow to start up."
B078NCL7GK,Moriah,5,"I am in love with this phone. You won't regret getting this phone. The camera is amazing takes clear sharp photos and the speaking plays loud and clear. Additionally, the apps open fast and flawless have not experienced any lag while using my phone. The appearance of the phone is crisp and it is so lightweight. The display is also very clean and bright. I am very pleased with this phone and if you choose to purchase it you would be too."
B078NCL7GK,Storcov,5,Great phone for the price. I've been using it for a few months and love it. No bugs or issues.
B078NCL7GK,Mike,5,Great phone for the price
B078NCL7GK,melinator85,5,Excellent phone. As close to iPhone as Android can get. Best of both worlds together. Love the finger print id to unlock. Also screen is nice and large and it's very fast
B078NCL7GK,Dahmain,4,I wish it had type C and a fast charger... I think the Honor 8 was a better version. The camera and other apps react very buggy sometimes
B078NCL7GK,Bob Sacamano,5,"Works great, but speaker could be better. Speaker phone function is weak for conversation, music or videos."
B078NCL7GK,Camil W.,5,love it everything works great.. good updates reliable phone and AMAZING CAMERA! everyone goes crazy over how good my camera is.
B078NCL7GK,Tanya Nelmar,5,Read lots of reviews on this phone. I really like it. It has lots of functions that you only find on the high dollar phones. Extremely easy to set up. Really surprised. Will be buying another one for the hubby in a few weeks.
B078NCL7GK,martin sandoval,1,I bought this phone less than a month ago and it has some issues. First week was great then it started freezing having 2-3 apps open. Now for no reason the screen will go black for no reason. Not worth the money.
B078NCL7GK,Dan Fisher,5,"I've only had this phone for several weeks, it works great so far. I'm impressed with the quality, ease of using, looks, and quick charging capability. Highly recommend!"
B078NCL7GK,Joey Castellon,5,Honor makes excellent phones at unbeatable prices. Absolutely recommend this one if you want a near flagship experience at a great price.
B078NCL7GK,J-Fernando,5,"I received the product in perfect condition. No problem of compatibility with my cellular operator in Canada. The shipment was made very, really fast. Totally satisfied with the service and the quality of the product. Thank you."
B078NCL7GK,Shirley Somora,4,My daughter just got this phone today for her birthday she is 15! So far she is in love with it. She lives the bigger screen and the camera is pretty good. Time will tell!!!
B078NCL7GK,Allentown,5,"Never used an Apple or Samsung, but this Huawei is way better than any phone I used before, exceed my expectation in any way."
B078NCL7GK,Ondadawg,5,Performed above other phones at similar price. Only disappointment is lack of USB type C.
B078NCL7GK,RC,5,Such an amazing deal. It's a very good phone at this price. Highly recommend.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,3,An issue is that the face unlock is a little off and sometimes takes too long. Another more important issue is that the phone sometimes becomes really slow and unresponsive for about five minutes and then returns to normal
B078NCL7GK,George Parker,4,"This is an amazing phone for the price, with one reservation. I find the battery life to be mediocre to poor. Make sure that you take a power pack with you."
B078NCL7GK,Lisa Ramroop,4,"I absolutely love this phone! Great interface, easy to use and navigate. Great storage options. Basically, premium quality without premium price, a definite superb buy."
B078NCL7GK,Krish G,5,Finger print scanning is blazing fast. Mobile is very good and easy to use. I fell in love with this phone. I would recommend everyone to go for it.
B078NCL7GK,Ewwilson3,5,"Love it. Works as advertised. Suitable camera. Long battery life. Thin, but relatively durable, but highly recommend a protective case that suits your lifestyle."
B078NCL7GK,a. clinkinbeard,5,"I love my phone. I've always had iPhones, but was frustrated with the software upgrades that seemed to make my phones obsolete.
I love my honor 7x. It is big, high quality and works great. It has a better feel than my wife's iPhone 10.

I had to wait 2 weeks for delivery, but love it!!"
B078NCL7GK,anonymous,5,Great phone for the price. Can't believe people pay $1000 when you can get phones like this one under $200
B078NCL7GK,Henry,5,"Great phone for the price. Good looking, great camera, the screen is quite big and bright. Excellent buy."
B078NCL7GK,A.W,5,Bought it to replace my honor 5X Huawei is really stepping its Smartphone game up Watchout Samsung and Apple
B078NCL7GK,Logan Franks,5,"This phone is amazing. The battery lasts all day. I used to have an S7 edge and after 6 hours of normal use I would be down to 15% what's amazing about this phone is that after 6 hours of the same use, Instagram spotify, messaging i went from 83% to just 70% Phone is extremely responsive. Great buy."
B078NCL7GK,Khadeem,4,"Just got it a few ago and I'm really liking it; the only bad thing about it is the font camera ððð 8mg, type disappointing. That aside, completely worth it. Hopefully the 8x comes soon; that's definitely worth $200"
B078NCL7GK,S G,4,"Works well, but you get what you pay for.... The sound is not great, touch response is not the best.
Battery life is very good"
B078NCL7GK,Tim j.,3,Good phone does anything you need (have not gamed on it though). Unfortunately a week or so after i got it a pixel died on the lower half of the screen; i don't mind it too much but it is something you should take into consideration.
B078NCL7GK,Mr. H,3,I had the honor 6x and I believe that performed better than the 7x. Notifications don't come through consistently and now I have data deadzone areas even though it is the same sim card. I miss my 6x
B078NCL7GK,Sara jadoo,2,It is a really nice phone except I'm having trouble with the speaker. It is really extorted.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"My only beef with this product is that they removed the capability to move apps and such to an SD card, at 32 gb you are kinda limited once you've downloaded music and such, everything esle is A+ tho"
B078NCL7GK,Authority Anue,4,"I've had the phone for around 4 months now and it is a great phone for the price! Of course the camera is not as good as like a super expensive phone, but it takes decent enough photos. The speakers are very good and there are so many features that are customizable so you can really make the device your own. I definitely believe that this is a quality phone."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,The camera takes awhile to focus. And the speaker is okay kinda quiet. Browsing the internet and watching videos are great the screen is a nice size and the picture looks great. It comes with a clear case cause the phone is really sleek and slippery by itself. Has a good battery life. I thinks it's one of the better budget phones available.
B078NCL7GK,Thomas A,4,"Likes- premium look and feel, 18:9 screen ratio, fast fingerprint scanner and facial recognition, good battery life, great price.
Dislikes- lousy mono speaker, micro USB port, no NFC, unable to move apps to SD card."
B078NCL7GK,Sanjay,5,"Perfect size. Not too big not too small. Good user interface, nice camera, and HD screen."
B078NCL7GK,B. Jones,5,"I love this phone, nice and big."
B078NCL7GK,Samuel G.,5,"Great Cellphone, more than i expected"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,for the price hard to beat
B078NCL7GK,Triin,5,So far works great. Has all the features as more expensive phones. Really happy with it
B078NCL7GK,Sara Sheldon,1,"I liked the phone design and it worked fine for about a week of light use. Then the first sign of trouble appeared - screen flashing purple streaks that would not stop until reboot. Invalid MMI code error appeared although there was no connection problem initially.
A few days later screen froze and unit would not boot up.. After factory reset the phone worked for a day and then froze again. From that point on the phone got stuck in boot up screen with no ability to even turn it off. Factory reset stopped working, clearing cache had no effect. HiSuite software was no help since phone settings had to be adjusted every time it was connected via USB, otherwise HiSuite would not detect the phone, even though Windows had no problem seeing it and accessing files on the phone.
Call to Huawei tech support, although pleasant enough, provided no solution other than offer of shipping the phone for repair.
It may be that I was just unlucky and the unit I received was defective, but since I consider reliability to be the most important feature of the cell phone I have to mark it as completely unsatisfactory."
B078NCL7GK,anupam t.,5,This phone is so mush better for the this price. It is fast and has most of the features compared to all the high end $1000 phones.
B078NCL7GK,Tommato,5,Ordered for teenage son. Lasting much longer than last two iPhones.
B078NCL7GK,Joseph L,5,"I've had this phone over a week now and like it more each day. I had been attached to my HTC One M9 but it had contracted degenerative terminal battery disease; symptoms include spontaneous power off and battery standby of an hour or less. As the disease ran it's inevitable course I knew I had to replace it. Investigation of possible battery transplant offered little hope. The new HTC U11 was way out of my price range also one thing I really wanted was offline FM radio and because wireless companies prefer that you use data it's frequently only on one-off brands and cheap phones. I kept running across the Huawei honor7x. While there are some scathing reviews, there are some scathing reviews for every phone so the percentage of good reviews must be taken into consideration. The screen quality, camera, battery, processor & GPU, my offline FM radio, and Tricorde-resque plethora of sensors, overall build tells me I've made the right decision. Since receiving it Wednesday I've charged it 3 times. I was charging my HTC 3-6 times per day and even that was insufficient. The complaints in the harsher reviews of the Huawei honor7x frequently indicate ""lagging"" but they also say it's resolved by a reboot, "" only to return again at some point in the future.
So for a $200 phone with premium features, occasionally one may have to turn it off then on again. THE HORROR!!
Others dislike the micro USB vs USB-C. I personally am relieved I don't need to replace my numerous charging cables. Also, complaints about no Qualcomm quick charge.
With light to moderate use, the H7X lasts me 3 days between charges. Also, it's 1/4 the price of a premium phone. If they are going to omit something I'm glad it's that. What else? Oh no wireless charging either. While inductive oscillating charging is kinda neat, it's slow, hard on circuitry due to heat and testy, if your device isn't right on the correct spot it doesn't charge so you just put your phone down for a while, which can be a good thing on its own, but it still needs changing. So again, it's$200, and if you feel that strongly about wireless charging you can buy a kit. Personally I think my $200 phone should go to work for me in the morning so I can sleep, keep me sexually gratified and cook my dinner, but that's not what phones do. Conversely, if you are not willing to spend close to $1000 on a phone there are some things that you are going to have to do without. That being said, the H7X isn't really a compromise, you are getting far more for your money in my book! Thank you Huawei! Excellent phone at an excellent value!"
B078NCL7GK,Patricia A. Wallis,5,"Simple, not expensive, very functional. I removed a bunch of the installed Huawei apps to clean things up. Liked this phone that I ordered for my husband so much that I bought a second for myself!"
B078NCL7GK,calvin,5,"This phone is reasonable price for person likes me to use daily. Do not expect the camera this one with high end phone.
It will take a good picture in outside daytime.
Thanks,
Hung"
B078NCL7GK,Bek,4,"Really good for price. Everything is as expected, recommend for all!!! only one minus, cannot find any screen protector"
B078NCL7GK,Rebekah S,5,"I have really enjoyed my phone thus far. The quality is very good, and easy to navigate. Similar to Samsung which I like because I don't like the iphone setup. Holds the charge for a long time and recharges quickly. The size is decent, large screen. If you have small hands like me it can be difficult to handle sometimes with one hand. 5 stars overall!"
B078NCL7GK,Christopher,5,"Quite snappy (quick) smartphone.
EMUI 8 is very responsive.
If you are thinking about upgrading from the Honor 6X to the Honor 7X, I would recommend it.
It is still an amazing phone in 2019."
B078NCL7GK,william,4,I cant write a full review on the phone because I just received it today but I will caution against buying the amazon recommended case for the phone. There was a case included with the phone that is almost exactly the same. Save yourself $12.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,It's great phone for the price! I live the way it feels in my had and it runs fairly smooth too. I use the GPS on this almost everyday and it works great and very accurate. The real only down sides to this phone is the camera and the speaker isn't very loud. But I've owned it for 2 months or so and I am very happy with my purchase.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,Great phone for the money. Quality build and a beautiful screen. Don't pass this one up.
B078NCL7GK,Jeffrey B.,3,"Watch out, the volume is VERY VERY LOW. Otherwise, great budget phone!"
B078NCL7GK,Davit M.,5,"Very good phone,with very good parameters,no lag at all,and it offers the functions that other even high class phones doesn't offer totally worths it.Also it will soon get EMUI 8.0 update,so it will add even more features."
B078NCL7GK,Sydney,5,"Best phone ive ever had. Pictures are nice I even took my senior photos with this phone, I'll post them on here to show you how good the camera is. There are so many features. Sounds great and it's fast. Its unlocked so I can use any cell service so I chose Trackphone cause it's cheap. 10/10 would recommend."
B078NCL7GK,phillip,4,"Shipped quick and easy, great phone for the price, big screen"
B078NCL7GK,Stevie H,5,Phone is as discribed. Put in sim worked right off. Sound is not the best for music though. Plays real quiet. Amazing photos
B078NCL7GK,Brady Pawson,5,Very happy with phone! Very reasonable price for what you get. Performs as well as the more expensive models. Would buy another!
B078NCL7GK,missy,5,Phone is great works with straight talk if you have the Sim that runs off at&t towers. Good battery life and the pictures quality is amazing.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"The AT&T website was having a problem, and complained about the IMEI, but everything is working well after I went to the AT&T Store. Fantastic phone! This phone feels like a phone costing several times more."
B078NCL7GK,antuan robinson,4,Like any phone it has its issuse but for $200 this is an incredible deal ...This phone premiered with $800 features and worked like a $600 phone.....the Oreo update gave this phone even more value
B078NCL7GK,Meare1,5,"This phone is DEFINITELY worth the $199 price tag. It is great to have a quality phone at a relatively inexpensive price. No buyers remorse, issues, or complaints..... My wife loves her's too !!!"
B078NCL7GK,Unhappy Customer,1,I thought this was awesome ..bought this after reading so many good reviews. Don't know if this is a defective items but the phone shuts down and restarts constantly. Reset it to factory condition twice but no luck. Returning this phone.

B078NCL7GK,Skyraini,4,Picture quality isn't that great but it was a gift for a teen who enjoys it very much! Thx!
B078NCL7GK,Joel D. Cady,4,For the price I haven't seen a better phone.
B078NCL7GK,zhen Z.,5,This phone is far better in quality than it's actual price. The benchmarks are good and the camera is far better than the majority of android phones. Coming from an apple user this product is a great alternative.
B078NCL7GK,Kevin Phillips,5,"This phone goes all day, great kids phone if you are not on a CDMA carrier and you want something cheap for the kids. Dont believe in putting out $1000 to what equates to an MP3 player or a kids toy."
B078NCL7GK,tsr,3,"So far all has worked perfectly but price dropped 10%in three weeks, how about a 20 dollar refund to my account."
B078NCL7GK,Ben B,2,"Receive audio very weak, Bluetooth intermittent/weak. I would not recommend this phone to anybody!"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,I love this phone so much. I just got it and for the price it works amazing. If you're doubting which color to buy just get the blue!!! It's so beautiful. Looks better than most brand new smartphones.
B078NCL7GK,Lucy,5,"Pros:

B078NCL7GK,âAwesome Sauceâ,2,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Changing my four star review after a month of solid use to a measly two stars. The original review is below. After a month of use, about half the time the phone locks up. You can have about three or four windows open at a time before things start getting a little unusable. Sometimes it'll happen with just a single window open and sometimes it will happen with NO WINDOWS open. Still, this is not the worse part. The worse part is that the phone and/or apps will become unresponsive without you knowing. Many times, my Nike Run Club has crashed and missed 15-30 minutes worth of my run because it crashed and the phone still showed the app running in the background. I never had the same issue with my Axon 7 or my Galaxy S7. Using GPS to get to a work-site you've never been before? Good luck. Same problem happens.

The sound and video quality remains solid and I still think the phone itself is absolutely BEAUTIFUL.

Although this is nothing against the phone itself, I am unable to find tempered glass that will stay on longer than two weeks which leaves my phone vulnerable to damage at super inconvenient times and forces me to rush order new tempered glass so that I can preserve it as much as I can. It's disappointing that not many manufacturers are manufacturing good quality accessories for this device. Again, nothing against the phone but if you really want to protect it, there's not many good options that will work long enough to be worth it.

I kept thinking to myself, how can a phone this beautiful have such subpar performance on a regular basis? I get overheating phones, or having way too many apps and windows open, or trying to do too much at a single time but this phone can barely handle an email window open, a browser in the background, and a water time app waiting in the background for my water intake. Save yourself some headache and buy something different. I'm going to have to replace it with something that can handle my typical usage, which believe me, is not crazy. I mostly use my phone for work. At most it'll have my work app, my work email, and a browser open. Even then it suffers in performance. If you're a power user or use your phone a lot for everything or just use your phone in moderation, this is a hard pass. If you only ever have one or two apps open at most, and you're okay with your phone locking up at any time for any reason, then you'll probably get by.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

For $200.00, you can't beat the quality.

Especially when you first setup the phone, the phone will be under a great deal of load. It's a no-brainer since your phone is usually installing all of your apps from your previous phone and the corresponding updates for the system as well. Still, even casual use will lock up the phone. This isn't a huge deal. Close your 4 million apps and try performing the same task again, it should work without issue. That being said, as someone who needs to use this phone for IT work, the lock up can be frustrating sometimes. If you're on a budget and you want a little better performance, plop down the extra $30 and go for the 4GB, 64GB version of this phone found here (trust me, I wish I had done the same but it's not worth the effort just yet):Â Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked 5.93"" - 4GB/64GB Octa-core Processor| 16MP + 2MP Dual Camera| Grey (US Warranty)

The 5.93"" phone screen is AMAZING. I put it right next to my brother's iPhone X, who by the way had been bragging about his new iPhone X for months, and he went quiet before releasing a subtle ""wow."" When I told him how much money it cost, he shook his head in disbelief. Screen transitions can be customized, you can add 5x6 app tiles, and the stock backgrounds and lock screens are visually pleasing to look at. Sometimes I find myself waking my phone just to remind myself of how awesome the phone really is.

Storage is a bit of a bust. The system takes about half the storage of the phone. If you buy a 32GB, be ready to have about 18GB of storage to actually use. Again, if you're on a budget but you need double the storage, check the link I posted earlier because that is the exact same phone with an extra GB of RAM and an extra 32GB of storage on top of what this phone currently has.

My only regret is that I didn't upgrade for $30 to 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage but you can be assured that once you have this phone, you'll forget what a galaxy or iPhone is, or why they even exist."
B078NCL7GK,Shai,5,"I don't usually review but the phone is great for a budget phone, it even has some features that some more expensive phones have! It takes nanosim so be cautious if you have an older phone. All I wish is that it could've came with the Oreo update and some headphones, but besides that it really seems worth it!

Update: Works with MetroPCS, just purchased a nano-sim and everything works great so far."
B078NCL7GK,Jacob,5,"The only negative I have found with this phone is the speaker. It isn't very loud, but it really doesn't matter considering how well this phone functions on every other platform. It is worth the money."
B078NCL7GK,Sophia Simpson,4,I am an honor fan. This one is great so far. However the audio is not that great.
B078NCL7GK,Natalie C. Crawford,5,"This phone is amazing. I have had several phones, and this by far
exceeds all of them
Apple does not come close to this phone. Any one looking for a new
phone should look at the Honor 7. You won't be disappointed."
B078NCL7GK,Sairam Nusetty,3,I bought this over the thanksgiving weekend and took it on a vacation with me to India. However this phone didnât have a voice over lte support which it claims to have.

B078NCL7GK,Gabriel H.,5,"Big screen, amazing battery life, speedy response and good signal. I'm really liking the phone. Only complain is the speaker could be louder, water resistant and wish it used USB c but that's just me nit-picking and was resolved with an adapter for a magnetic charger"
B078NCL7GK,Cld. S,5,I love this phone. smooth gaming experience and unique look.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,Amazing phone for the price. If your connecting it via MetroPCS. You have to take the devince in to a store to get the phone activated. Battery life is great with optimal use.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"Item is working very good, I think is very good option in category smartphone under 200. recommended"
B078NCL7GK,TacticalJ3diJ33pLife,5,awesome deal . great specs for the money .
B078NCL7GK,Luppa,5,"Perfect phone, there really isn't much to say. Honor phones are seriously the best these days. Especially for this price.
The one and only issue I have with it is that sometimes, when I'm writing, my touch doesn't register and I end up missing letters."
B078NCL7GK,Joseph,4,I love the phone it's my second one.. All though I did by a case they recommend a slight fall from waist high cracked the screen.. case or no case don't drop it.

B078NCL7GK,Jeon Junkook,5,You should defiantly buy this if it's your first phone. It comes with an available transparent case. It also has long lasting battery holder with is a super deal package. It's a great deal. My friend and I were searching for a phone for me. I though it would be a risky thing but it wasn't. It's a super great deal. Trust me It's worth it.
B078NCL7GK,david ortega,4,The sound is very bad!! Before i had an moto G4 and i thought this cell is better but not... I put the max volume and i can hear the external sounds... Don't buy if the music is important for You... I regret...
B078NCL7GK,wai,5,Very nice smart phone and very fast. Price is very good too.
B078NCL7GK,Michael Gutierrez,5,Android 8.0 Oreo! I cannot stress enough how thrilled I am that a sub $200 phone has a newer version of Android than most high end phones! This phone is fast and the screen looks great! Really happy with my purchase.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"My favorite phone so far. Just a picture quality is a little weak, phone service drops in certain places, lags hardcore if you don't manage your apps."
B078NCL7GK,Horacio Sep,4,"It's not as fast as my Nexus 5x was, however considering the price it is a OK phone.
My favorite part is the camera which unfortunately once in a while freezes.
My least favorite part is that it doesn't come with a USB type C."
B078NCL7GK,cherie glover,4,Very nice phone. I like how I can change the font and the themes on it. Change it up some. 2 thumbs up :) definitely worth it. Thanks.

OS update brings you face recognition and improvements all over the phone.

Excellent phone in every single aspect."
B078NCL7GK,Briona Gurley,5,"I love this phone but there are some technical issues. It needed two system updates just so I could use the Internet and the screen doesn't respond sometimes. Other than those the phone itself is good. The screen is so clear, the camera is great."
B078NCL7GK,Mau Bo,4,The quality of the camera and microphone could be better but overall I loved the phone

B078NCL7GK,SCMorgan,4,I love my Honor 7X. The only issue I have is that it gets really slow sometimes and I need to restart it. Everything else is great. So that is not a deal breaker.
B078NCL7GK,DVFAMZ,5,"Phone smokes the Samsung Galaxy s6 Active I had. Was also easy to root, etc... Love it! Very fast, looks great. The only con is the camera focuses a bit slowly... But, I don't take tons of pictures."
B078NCL7GK,crys,5,Cheap(ish) phone for pretty good quality. Easy to use.
B078NCL7GK,Customer,5,"It is a great a phone with features that I find useful for every day use. I recommend it since it's a budget phone that is advanced in the quality it holds. It doesn't heat up. The GPS works. The camera is good and on top of that, it doesn't crash but may rarely lag. Overall, it qualifies to be one of the best budget phones around."
B078NCL7GK,Gary,4,Great phone and great price. The only reason I didnât give it 5atara was because it does not have wi-if calling which would be great for where I live.
B078NCL7GK,N. Christianson,5,Nice phone stands up to abuse well.
B078NCL7GK,Jasmyn,4,"Pros

B078NCL7GK,Andre,5,"After constantly buying crappy metro phones. I had enough and wanted a better phone that'd last me a while. I saw this phone while looking at the Sony Xperia. Phone looked beautiful but the bezel was too big. Then I saw the honor 7x. I drooled at the features this thing had. I watched videos. Read reviews. Even purposely looked at why you shouldn't buy it the reason weren't enough to make me not want to buy. It came 2-3 days than expected and the box itself looks extremely sexy. The way they have the tape at the bottom so you'll know of someone was in it. Then when it came to opening the box it came off like butter and seeing the phone was an instant nut. It was smooth, had a nice weight, and screen. Mmmamamia it was sleek. When turning it on the UI was amazing. It had an iPhone and Android mix. Forget team Android or iPhone, phone had both. Settings it up was a breeze. Downloading apps. Easy. Then I went to settings to turn on all the cool features. I went straight to looking for the option to expand the screen on any app. I tell you what, with this option my phone looks like any iPhone someone would have. You keep the back of the phone down and nobody would know the difference. This phone is more than awesome especially for only $200. All I have to say is to not download too many apps. It will take up all the Ram and it will start to slow down."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,This is probably one of the best budget phones on the market. What you get is so much more than you pay for.
B078NCL7GK,Joseph A. Nickence,5,"An excellent phone! It does everything I need, for a great, affordable price."

B078NCL7GK,s'Tos,5,"Awesome phone. Fast, and reliable."
B078NCL7GK,A. Rosa,1,"This phone has 32gig memory and 8 processors. It was taking forever to download all the bloatware. I could see that much of this space would be consumed by trash I dint want. I tried to watch video, amazon video to be exact on this phone. Dispite it having a supposedly good screen resoplution, superior to my current Blu phone it was horribly fuzzy. I dont know why. Back in the box it went. The very medioiocre battery life was another factor. When the time comes I'll just get another Blu phone with a good sized battery since I know this is a big factor for me. If the battery runs out it wont matter what the resolution is or how many processors the phone has, it wont work."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Love this phone so far. The display is big but not ""too big"". My husband loved it so much, he got one!"

B078NCL7GK,Elizabeth Van Lauwe,5,"This is a fine phone for the price. My old Samsung finally died after 3 1/2 years. This is a feature rich phone. The colors are vibrant and the AI is awesome for the price of this phone. About battery life. I use my phone for calling and texting and google calendar and photos. I charged phone day I had chip installed (T-Mobile). My battery had 19% left after seven days, so I find the battery life more than adequate.
The phone is very fast and was easy to hook back into T-mobile. First phone call automatically went to T mobile. Gave them my old chip # and new chip #, they sent me verification code on my email, read it back to them and I was good to go. It did come with a clear case cover included. I am very satisfied with the purchase."
B078NCL7GK,Alessandro V.,2,"It's the second one I order. I like the phone alot but like the 2nd one is lags and the options ""wait or close app"" pop up often aside from that it present an issue with Instagram stories and I can't find a solution but the first phone did that as well get back to me with possible solutions??"

B078NCL7GK,david ortega,4,The sound is very bad!! Before i had an moto G4 and i thought this cell is better but not... I put the max volume and i can hear the external sounds... Don't buy if the music is important for You... I regret...
B078NCL7GK,wai,5,Very nice smart phone and very fast. Price is very good too.
B078NCL7GK,Michael Gutierrez,5,Android 8.0 Oreo! I cannot stress enough how thrilled I am that a sub $200 phone has a newer version of Android than most high end phones! This phone is fast and the screen looks great! Really happy with my purchase.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"My favorite phone so far. Just a picture quality is a little weak, phone service drops in certain places, lags hardcore if you don't manage your apps."
B078NCL7GK,Jose Miguel Amaya Rivera,5,Good
B078NCL7GK,tobi adesiji,4,The phone is very sleek and fast. It's full specification was not displayed on the product details. I was expecting it to come with a 4gb Ram but it's ohk with 3gb at it's price.
B078NCL7GK,Shanice,5,"Purchased this for a friend, he was certainly longing for it and seems to really enjoy it."
B078NCL7GK,Kindle Customer,1,"Slow, sloooooowww, sssllloooooowwwwww POS. Locks up, backs up ucks up."
B078NCL7GK,True customer,5,Cannot be beat for the quality and features at sub-$200 price. This phone is easily on par if not better than phones at $350 and above.
B078NCL7GK,Menashe P.,5,"Best budget phone out there no doubt, impossible to tell it's 200$"
B078NCL7GK,Nicholas Summerlee,5,"Once again the Chinese have done an incredible job of giving flagship phone build quality with upper tier internal components as well as high end features like dual cameras all for 200 dollars. I ended up giving the my 6X to the misses as she really needed an upgrade while I'll preordered this 7X. They improved on the screen size as well as improving build quality and material feel. The slight curve towards the lateral edges of the device give it a pseudo S8 kind of feel in the hand. Side buttons have a good feel and click like a top notch device. The also went with protruding lenses in the back like Apple, possibly do to light restriction on the previous model when a case was used. Huawei also makes it super easy to put everything from your old phone to your new phone with their clone app that even a smart phone novice could do in less than ten minutes. Good job on making the best budget phone out there Huawei. You've got a lifelong American customer here."
B078NCL7GK,Ranish,4,Like it for the price
B078NCL7GK,Ian Marlowe,2,"At first it was great. An ideal phone for the price. The camera was buggy as hell and took forever to start, but installing a 3rd party app fixed it. Then it would occasionally freeze and hang, but I didn't mind too much. After all, it was $200. THEN this morning, it died with no reason. It worked last night, and this morning I wake up to a dead phone. Just like that. No warning, nothing. There's no smell, the charger works, the cable is fine, it's just dead. Yesterday I got a popup from one of the pre-installed apps saying I could use it to contact their customer support if I ever needed it. I hadn't seen that. How suspicious that it died within 24 hours of that message. How does a phone die right at the 2 month mark? Baloney. This was my second Huawei phone and the other one wasn't great (the battery lasts less than 8 hours only a year after purchase), but was a real budget phone. I won't be getting any more of their junk if this is how it works."
B078NCL7GK,ramon,5,Ok
B078NCL7GK,stpet004,5,Great phone for your money I like it a lot
B078NCL7GK,safa,5,item as describe

B078NCL7GK,Tammy,4,Descent phone. No complaints
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,"I bought this phone on July to replace my wife's old phone. However my wife did not use it right away, and when she started using it, the battery was bad. It cannot charge. The return window is closed and the product service is also closed."
B078NCL7GK,Keith Nelson,4,Still getting used to android after using apple product for years so I have some frustrations that having nothing to do with the phone. Image is good and performance is very adequate. Well worth the price.
B078NCL7GK,Tayler Singleton,5,I'm loving the new phone. It does not have any problems at the moment and is the best phone I've had for the price.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,I didn't get a USB cable with my package other than that I like
B078NCL7GK,Nope_really,5,Great
B078NCL7GK,Denise Boodoo,3,My phone blanked off.. how do i find out about warranty. Please email me
B078NCL7GK,Larissa R Lee,5,Purchased as an emergency temp replacement until the Pixel 3 is released but I may end up keeping it! Can't beat the price (Prime Day).
B078NCL7GK,Greg W,4,"It's a surprisingly good phone for it's price category. But not without flaws. One very annoying problem with the phone is that some apps can freeze and remain non-responsive for minutes. I have this problem quite often with the camera app and Google Maps. Just because of that I'm thinking of switching back to my Moto G5, which was performing flawlessly except that I wasn't happy with the quality of the photos. I got Honor 7X because it's supposed to have a very good picture quality. And the phone UI is very responsive and perfroms quite well except at times when the apps are frozen/stuck. The phone is very nice overall, good signal and call quality, no issues with bluetooth, nice, large screen, battery rarely drops to 50% at night. The speaker isn't as good as the one on Moto G5 (wow that thing can be loud), the phone ringing and notifications are much easier to miss on the Honor."
B078NCL7GK,Nicole McKenzie,5,Great phone. Loving it so far.
B078NCL7GK,a,5,great
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,good quality overall. best buy. recomended
B078NCL7GK,gingerpeach,4,"I drop it all the time and it looks great. Not a fan of not being able to use the phone at all if the camera is covered, but other than that it is a great phone."
B078NCL7GK,Dinomite07,4,"cheap, works fine but i have to use the phone without the case because for some reason the gps doesnt work with a case on. i assume the signal is being blocked with a case"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Shopper Â®,5,Nothing bad to say about it. I mainly use it has huge screen for my Mavic Air
B078NCL7GK,LeAnna,5,This is great little phone. It's very sleek and beautiful. It's not the fastest phone all the time but the battery life is amazing. I can 2 days without having to charhe. It's honestly amazing for that reason.
B078NCL7GK,Marc Twain,4,Great phone... The only complaint is the phone does not have WiFi calling .... It would have been good if Amazon would add this special in the description. All in all it's a great phone and great connection on metro PCS
B078NCL7GK,Twynklette,5,"Love it. Works great, great camera, good storage, cheap price"
B078NCL7GK,Alberto007,5,good quality
B078NCL7GK,markreif,5,worth the wait
B078NCL7GK,Eli Contu-Owen,4,Reliable
B078NCL7GK,timothy,5,I luv this phone a must have a good budget phone
B078NCL7GK,Patrick hinds,5,Now my wife wants one and I'm ordering it right now
B078NCL7GK,Matt,2,"Slower than advertised, mostly due to the amount of space that is taken up by the software. Frequently closes apps in the middle of usage, and the screen broke between going to bed and waking up, while sitting on a dresser"
B078NCL7GK,Ranger,5,Good mid price phone.
B078NCL7GK,Annakyoyama88,5,"Comes with a free jelly like case, couldn't get a better phone for the price point. Just beware, the screen is very easy to crack, so try to avoid dropping the phone on it's corners."
B078NCL7GK,Melissa Diaz,5,My son uses it to download games and music
B078NCL7GK,Robin kirk,5,So far I love it!!!
B078NCL7GK,June,5,This smartphone gives you a bang for your buck. Excellent! I'm thinking of buying another.
B078NCL7GK,Naresh K.,5,good one.
B078NCL7GK,Rolando,5,good
B078NCL7GK,Misty G,5,This phone is a great value. It came with a case which I wish I realized because I purchased another case. The case that came with it was a better quality!
B078NCL7GK,Quarious T.,4,Grate phone
B078NCL7GK,joe goodwin,5,Worth $350
B078NCL7GK,Bharanidharan,5,good phone
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I love it! It tells you how much ram you're using, it's fast, it looks great, love the big screen! Overall great! The storage isn't great but its WELL worth the price. Love it!!"
B078NCL7GK,G. Lin,5,Would buy again
B078NCL7GK,Santos Tecum,4,"It's really a good phone for the given price. It feels and looks like of really good quality material but under pressure the phone might slow down. Also, the speakers are a bit tiny but otherwise it's a really good phone."
B078NCL7GK,Rick Masseur,5,"This is a truly unlocked phone. I love it. I got rid of an iPhone for a Samsung Galaxy. It was a good move. Now I got rid of the Galaxy S5 for this Honor 7x. I don't need a cleaner app, or an anti-virus app, or a launcher (because I didn't like the forced home screen, etc) - because these types of apps or functionality come standard in the phone. I can set the grid size of the screens, set how the screens transition, etc.; all the functionality I wanted in Nova Launcher. The response time is fast. The fingerprint access is faster than the Samsung. This is certainly a ""flagship killer"". I use it with Straight Talk and it works just fine. Even switching my number to the new sim (I was already on ST) was quick and painless to do myself online in my account. I would definitely recommend this phone to my friends and family."
B078NCL7GK,angel,4,The sound could use some work and the placement of the speakers is bothersome but it's a really good phone with pleanty of features.
B078NCL7GK,Martine,5,just love it
B078NCL7GK,Sundar Shivshankar,1,Honor 8 was great. So bought this phone. The camera always crashes. Phone is laggy and almost usable. I am an Android device pro and really know how to use an Android device. This is a very poor followup of Honor8 Device.
B078NCL7GK,EUCHARIA U. O,5,"I purchased this phone for my daughter as an upgrade from her previous honor 5x, and she loves it. Great phone!"
B078NCL7GK,FireMetal&Stress,4,"Only had it a few days.
Thus far, seems to be a really nice phone for the price.
Nice camera too.
Only complaint so far is that Huawei's proprietary Android build prevents you from installing apps onto the SD card.
(which is easily done on most other android builds.)
Its internal memory of 32GB ships half-full with just theOS and the apps that cannot be removed.
And yes i have set the SD as the default storage location. But the apps still get loaded onto the internal memory and cannot conveniently be moved."
B078NCL7GK,Antonio Nez,4,Still have it. I slammed my car trunk on it but did not crack. But bent a little.
B078NCL7GK,Christian,5,Very good
B078NCL7GK,RG,4,Great phone for only $200
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,Easy to set up...doesn't feel cheap...it is unlocked...very smooth
B078NCL7GK,William Bryant,4,I am honored to be an owner of the honor 7. The phone still performing great
B078NCL7GK,S. Nkosi,3,"Liking it so far, but I'm having issues with the touch sensitivity, I have to press the screen pretty hard."
B078NCL7GK,Miguel E. Andrade M.,5,"Great quality of the camera, great performance, the price/quality its great."
B078NCL7GK,babak,5,It's perfect for the price.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"Returned. Specs were too impressive to be true. The hardware is great and the software sucks big time. Phone hangs like nobody's business.
My wife owns Honor 6 which works well seeing which I had ordered 7X, but disappointed."
B078NCL7GK,Miguel Perez,1,"the processor of the phone is really slow, the application of the camera takes time to open and stays stuck. Applications like snapchat or some game are also hung. Actually with so much processor the phone is very bad, does not meet the expectations."
B078NCL7GK,Essadro Levy,4,I lile everything on this phone except the front camera i think it could be better. Ive been using this phone for a week and no problems or glitches. It is fast big and worth more than the price
B078NCL7GK,Junior,5,Best 200 ever spent!!
B078NCL7GK,A guy,5,"I'm pretty happy with the phone so far. Coming from a moto x pure (yeah downgrade) I never really used the specs. Also lenovo and motorolla I wasn't happy about. The battery was losing its life since I had for a couple of years. This phone is pretty snappy for the specs. I'm using spotify, and reddit mostly. If you want an affordable android phone for 2 BILLS this is it."

B078NCL7GK,VINAY DHANDHEL,5,I liked this new phone with all features in it. Wish USA version was like rest of the world's version with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. Apart from this everything is great.
B078NCL7GK,Michelle,4,I like it. Itâs beautiful and enoug weight which made me feel good in my hand.

B078NCL7GK,SsgRick00,5,I love this phone. Everything runs smoothly and the pictures come out cleanly even though I'm not a picture guy but I would recommend
B078NCL7GK,Drew Van Ausdall,5,For $200 I could not find a better phone. Works just as well as my Samsung Galaxy s8 did. The camera is fantastic as well.
B078NCL7GK,TC Chang,4,"Good deal phone with $200 bucks.
Nice display and 32G really allow me to download almost all of apps I need.

B078NCL7GK,Jaime Valbuena,5,Highly recommended
B078NCL7GK,smarintl,4,The build of the phone was great. No usb type c though and camera not the best as of 2019. Huawei still did well with it.
B078NCL7GK,Samiha,5,Love this phone
B078NCL7GK,Ryan,4,The audio and battery life are good for the price your paying for this device.feels like a $400-500 phone but only 200 wish it came with headphones but a free case is just fine.
B078NCL7GK,Paul,5,"This is a great phone for the price. If you're looking for a upgrade but don't want to pay 800.00 dollars, look at the Honor line up!"
B078NCL7GK,Viggo Y.,5,Best quality/price phone in the market right now. Bought it from Canada and it was still well worth it!
B078NCL7GK,Lucia Rodriguez,5,"Great phone, I use it with cricket wireless service, I just had to go to the store to get a nano sim card."
B078NCL7GK,Jack,4,"This is a great low budget phone with lots of features. I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with this phone. Since I only use rooted phones, every time I rooted my Galaxy, I would start to experience severe lag times after about 1 month of use or less. I would then have to backup, factory reset and re-setup my phone with all of my hundreds of applications.
I have rooted the Honor 7x and so far it is working flawlessly.

The only reason for the 4 stars is because Honor has not provided the latest Android system available. I've seen rumors that an update is coming, but no official word from Honor regarding this.

A great job to the folks at Honor for producing a great product."
B078NCL7GK,cuong hau,1,"For some reason, Huawei thinks it's a good idea to allow the phone operating system to kill/restrict 3rd party apps. During the 2 months of use, the system kills my alarm app 3 times, and twice of my game (playing). You can do some search up on Google about this ""feature"" they called ""ram management."" The feature is good to improve the performance of the phone if executed perfectly; especially for phones with less impressive hardware. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oneplus, Meizu, Lenovo, and Asus are well known for this ""feature."" Unfortunately, these companies code ""so-so"" quality software experience. The ""feature"" is not execute perfectly and kills needed apps."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,Best phone in this price range.
B078NCL7GK,H...P...,5,"great phone, easy to use and respond fast enough to running all apps!!"
B078NCL7GK,Kevin,5,Great phone
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,A decent upgrade from the 5x edition. Works just as well and in some ways better than the Galaxy counter part.

B078NCL7GK,KooHuang,5,Good I like it

B078NCL7GK,AlfinBC,5,Liked the phone and price. Did not like that red color was not available.
B078NCL7GK,Urvien,5,Like; very good phone for the price. If you expect Galaxy s9 performance you should buy the s9.

B078NCL7GK,lionel lanchance,5,Was a gift and the recipient loves it.

B078NCL7GK,Nicola,5,Great phone if you don't want to over pay for an iPhone or Samsung.
B078NCL7GK,lipo,5,"I have it now for several months, still good"
B078NCL7GK,Yoon-Ji Huang,1,"For the first 3-4 weeks I had this phone it was great. I never experienced any hiccups or lag. Call quality was good. I did have some minor bluetooth connectivity issues but it was nothing major. More annoying than a problem. However, the phone bricked itself. I'm not crazy, I promise, and I'm not lying. I had turned off my phone every night since getting it. Last night, it seems to have decided it didn't like that because when I went to turn it on this morning it got stuck on the ""Honor Powered by Android"" blue screen. I tried holding the power button, holding the power button + the volume up button, nothing. It wouldn't even turn off. So sadly I had to return it and I likely won't be buying a replacement. I understand I'm probably one in a million to have such an issue, but I'd rather not take my chances buying something that turns into a $200 paperweight after a month."

B078NCL7GK,Rachel,5,I love this phone! It is better than any of the BLU devices I have had.
B078NCL7GK,Juan Eduardo Rosero,5,Incredible affordable for the specifications
B078NCL7GK,Samantha Van Muyden,3,"I've had this phone for a little over 2 months and up until this last week I was thrilled with it. The body design is sleek and looks on par with bigger brand phones, and the interface had all the customization I love with androids as well as being user friendly and streamlined like apple products. It was a little glitchy or laggy with some higher memory usage apps like Snapchat and it doesn't do ""fast charging"" like the bigger brand phones do now, but overall I was over the moon with the performance and design of this phone for the price. However, in the last week when I plug it in to charge I've been noticing it either isn't charging all the way or it seems like the charge has decreased. I thought maybe I was unplugging it without thinking about it and then forgetting to plug it back in. But today it has almost completely stopped charging. I've tried 4 different chargers, including the one it came with, and it does not even acknowledge being plugged in.
I gave it 3 stars because while it took a charge, it was an awesome phone for the price. However, 2 months is a very short phone life. So if you're looking for a high quality-for-the-price phone for a short period of time, this phone would probably be perfect for you. But if you're looking for a phone to last and perform consistently for a long period of time, it's probably best to shell out a little more cash for higher quality."

you cannot have many apps open it freezes too, i have to keep closing to free the memory it says 3gb of ram but it feel like a 1gb ram with 1/2 already in use :/ :(.
body build looks amazing like the iPhones but not that strong i just dropped it this morning with a protective cace ON but that didn't stop from breaking the screen :( ."

B078NCL7GK,diane,5,Very nice phone.
B078NCL7GK,Kemayoul,5,The faster of the finger touch
B078NCL7GK,Tom Granig,5,"I have always used iPhones and bought this just to try out an Android phone. My previous phone was an iPhone 6s. I have been using it for my main phone for a couple of days and I really like it.

Pros:

Screen - The 18:9 screen is big and easy to use. The text is much sharper than on my iPhone (407 ppi vs 326 ppi on my iPhone). The viewing angles are a bit worse than my iPhone, but not by much. The display gets just as bright as my iPhone.

Batery life: It lasts quite a bit longer than my iPhone.

Build quality: The phone feels like it cost way more than $200, however the matte black version is like a fingerprint magnet.

Buttons: The power and volume buttons feel solid and not mushy.

Fingerprint scanner: The fingerprint scanner is so fast and accurate. Opens in less than half a second. Much faster than Touch ID gen 2.

Call quality: The sound from the earpiece is load and clear.

Camera: The secondary 2MP camera for wide aperture mode does not do such a good job at blurring out the background, however the primary sensor can capture very nice images on its own, especially closeups.

Cons:

WiFi and Bluetooth issue: When bluetooth is on Wifi speed drops significantly. This is because they share the same antenna, but I was still able to play 1080p YT videos to a bluetooth speaker, for $200 I can't really complain.

Main Speaker: It lacks mid and bass frequency and can easily be covered. My iPhones speaker was much better.

No 4k recording: This is due to a chipset limitation.

MicoUSB: At least you don't have to buy a bunch of new cables if you have a lot of microUSB cables.

No fast chrging: It charges as fast as my iPhone with the 1 amp charger.

--- After looking at my iPhone after using this, my iPhone just seems so ancient."

The Honor 7x is handsome and stylishly thin, the screen is beautiful and has really thin bezels, the performance is snappy, fingerprint unlock is nearly instantaneous, the camera does the cool defocused backgrounds, it comes with a nifty clear protective case, it's super-easy to set up, it comes with twice the internal memory of comparably priced competitors and one and a half times as much RAM, I mean, come on people. This phone makes the people who throw down $1000 for the latest iPhone look even sillier than they did before."

B078NCL7GK,Susan,1,"This phone, although having great specs, is very slow. It crashes constantly with even simple applications (i.e. camera, video calling, messenger) and if you have over ten apps running in the background then you may have trouble receiving calls or instant messages as the phone takes too long to respond. Constantly I was unable to receive calls as the screen would freeze being unresponsive to touch. Switching applications is also problematic and forget trying to use maps to get anywhere. Thoroughly disappointed in this purchase.

Pros: screen is great and high-quality."

B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"Either mine was defective or this has a 10 year old WiFi radio/receiver. I can't stream 480p or lower quality videos more than 10 feet from my router, more than 30 feet from my router websites take 1-2 minutes to load. I have devices hooked up all over my home that have no issues streaming video (Roku, game console, smart TV). I looked online for solutions thinking I have to be doing something wrong. Found a few (disable Bluetooth while streaming, software updates, etc.) but nothing made it better.

The display, which reviews indicated was a high point, is bad. Colors look washed out and muted. It has some sharpness to it, but the colors on my 3 year old Samsung J7 look much more vibrant. I tried messing around with all the display settings to no avail, simply can't make it look as good.

I give it an extra star because the design of the phone is sleek and the OS seemed snappy, but since it couldn't fulfill the basic promise of outperforming my outdated Samsung J7, it's hard to like much of anything."
B078NCL7GK,John_1,1,"Junk, Got the update to Oreo and after the update I have no screen notifications for calls, text messages and emails. Not even Honor's Support can't / won't figure out the fix. I opened a ticket with support and they keep giving me the run around..

Here is a copy of what i was told to do for the fix.

Frank C (Tue, 5/15/2018, 11:02:18 am)
We been having some issues with the recent updates but It's really helpful when people contact us as soon as you get any new update in order to let us know about any glitches/bugs the update might come with.
It might take up to a couple of days in order to get it.
Not all devices are updated at the same time since the updates are pushed in batches.
Just keep on checking the UPDATER option every week or so.
Try connecting it to different wifi networks.
And reboot it every 3-4 days.

This is just to get a fix..........

Update - 5-21-2018

After Oreo update..

Phone has been reset to factory defaults, Notifications have been changed again, changed sim, verified with provider no blocks on IMEI. Voice quality sounds like tin, Bluetooth drops even honor branded watches, Bluetooth wont stay connected to headphones. Charging extremely slow. Wifi slow and is hit or miss... Low light camera function leaves pictures dark and grainy. Zoom functionality for pictures are pretty bad. Touch screen only responds when it wants to.

Still no response from their support after opening ticket 6 days ago..

Update 5-24-2018

Honor support keeps contradicting their statements. our first chat he stated a few hours for a fix then in our second chat he stated 24 to 48 hours, finally they stated to check every week and reboot the phoneâ¦. So what am I supposed to do while I wait and wait for an update? I have a non-usable phone since I do not get alerts for texts, emails and phone calls coming in? Support stated the issue was resolved. Itâs not resolvedâ¦. What patch am I waiting for? I have other branded phones âLG, Samsung and a Google Pixelâ and when I contact support for an issue and they have to push out a patch for a fix itâs not done in batches as they state... it is usually within a day or less that I get a notification that a push is readyâ¦. So far this is the worst customer service Iâve gotten from a phone manufacturer. They told me to turn the phone in to their service dept, what will happen is I will get a refurbished phone back and then my current 1 year warranty goes to only 90 daysâ¦. That
is what has happened with the Honor 8 and the Honor 6x that I cannot use anymore due to their support center broke and refuse to fix the phones they broke..

Stay away from Honor or Hauwei products"

B078NCL7GK,NewEnglander,3,"Update (4 days later after purchase)
Unfortunately, I had to drop 2 stars after using the phone for 4 days. I started to hit serious lag. It seems like reviews you may find on youtube are reviewing the 4GB/64GB international version, because the US version with the 3GB/32GB is just not on par with the international version.
Why I dropped 2 stars?
- No 5ghz wifi connectivity. This is a serious bummer, since I only connect to the 5ghz frequency on my home wifi, since I had problems with other devices connecting and my wifi router routinely dropping some off the wifi-list,unless it's on the 5ghz freq. This is kinda interesting, since as far as I can remember, even phones from 2014 had ac 5ghz option.
- Extremely slow charging. I just can't get around with this. I can see people charging their phones at night, but there are phones out now with the same $200+ price range that do fast charging. Micro USB is one thing, there are phones that fast-charge with it, but again, we are in 2018.
- No NFC. Granted, there are only a few budget phones with NFC, but we need to look at from the point of view of the year 2018 just began and within a few months, more budget phones are coming out, packed with more features than ever before, even with NFC. Let this be the least of the problems, it's a compromise that most people can live with, if they don't use NFC (not using their phones with Google Play or transfer files etc. )
- Here is the worst. After several days, the phone began to lag. Whether it's from the new update, that popped up during setup, whether it's something to do with lesser memory than most phones or the interface itself, I don't know. I ended up disabling apps to gain some speed back, including disabling amazon apps, navigation apps and the built in Huawei apps. Then it continued. Browsing a webpage is like the scrolling acceleration is disabled or just the lag gets worse. Keep shutting down recently used apps won't help. Rebooting won't help, there is a constant lag while browsing in Chrome and in Facebook, something I don't experience in other budget phones for years now. Hopefully Huawei can address this in future updates, or could be just a few particular models effected, I don't know. It can get very annoying. There is something going on with the memory management, whatever, I am not an expert, but it just ruins the experience.
Speaker is ok, but still very tiny sound. Again, we are talking about a $200 phone, but consider the trade-offs.
In a nutshell, here is what to keep an eye out for when purchasing this phone:
+Nice bright screen, small bezels,
+Good camera for the price
+notification LED (many people prefer it)
+battery lasts a day for most people
+fingerprint reader is lightning fast
+Love/Hate heavy launcher skin over Android OS
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Lag can creep up after a certain amount time, restart needed, apps needs to be disabled, /wait for more updates?/
- Still on Android Nougat, no confirmed date for Oreo update
- Heavy launcher skin over Android OS
- No dual band wifi
-No NFC
-US version : 3GB RAM/32GB of onboard space
-Micro USB
-No fast charging
-No 4K recording capability
-No image stabilization
-tiny single speaker at the bottom
----------------------------------
At this point, I had luck to use the Honor 6X for 2 weeks last year and it was great. I would recommend that phone over this one."

B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I am pretty sure this is the best deal for the $200 price tag. I would recommend a oneplus phone for $500 or the essential phone, but if you only have $200 you can't go wrong with this. I have cricket and it works well.

Every phone has spyware in it. Like this one tells me how many footsteps I have taken each day (which means it knows where I have been). Every phone does this and I am glad it is more upfront about it.

If you are on a military installation, I recommend Sony, Apple, Samsung, or Nokia (stick to the allies)."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,Great!
B078NCL7GK,Aslien Reyes LeÃ³n,5,Good no problems.
B078NCL7GK,asia,5,"Excellent,I like it."
B078NCL7GK,Scuba Sue,1,"This phone didn't even really function. It froze all the time, and it took at least 10 seconds to open the camera, if ever. You could even see faces in sunny pictures, just a weird face outline."
B078NCL7GK,Wendy,5,This mobile is amazing!
B078NCL7GK,amory,4,"like the poster below that said his unit would not connect to his bluetooth speakers, i am also having that problem.

yamaha, anker, philips...no go. anyone have any idea what's up with that. i am going to return if i can;t work it out.

thanks

ok, so i returned the phone and the replacement immediately hooked up with all three of my speakers. now i have a problem with the new

one. the touch screen is a PIA. it is unresponsive towards the outer edges necessitating pushing several times to get a response.

i have to say that i wish i stayed with my motog4, the only thing it lacked was the fingerprint scanner."
B078NCL7GK,rafael alvarez,5,Excelente smartfhone. Ultrafast
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,Love it
B078NCL7GK,Benjamin samuel,4,"For$200,no complaints from me!!!"
B078NCL7GK,akhil,5,wonderful mobile.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,Amazing!!
B078NCL7GK,gabriel,5,Very good
B078NCL7GK,B cuda,5,"Update: Been using it for a week now, and still love it! **Check using willmyphonework.net to make sure your carrier will work on the phone your interested in**

So my last phone was a samsung Note 3. I had it Forever. But the Crack in the screen and slow lagging on this phone was starting to get to me. So was researching some phones that were 400 bucks and under. Based on lots of online reviews on YouTube and Google and of course here. I decided to try this phone. It is awesome. I love how it's android and also like the iphone. Pretty neat. I know it doesn't charge quickly but neither did my old phone so I'm ok with that. I'm not a power user. Just mostly for texting, phone and occasional social media, news etc. This is a great phone blows my old note 3 phone away.
**Also read on many blogs and news media that the honor 7x will be one of the lucky phones to get the new oreo update very soon** Can't wait for that!
This phone just keeps getting better each day. I'm really loving it. And at this price, can't beat it!"
B078NCL7GK,Everon Rice,2,"This device has mediore specs for the price, the Mate SE has an extra gig of ram and 64g's of storage for less than $40 more but my deal breaker was that, this phone will not send videos in any capacity. The camera records in 720p but no matter the length of videos, the phone still will not send in MMS messages. Not sure if this will be the same issue on the Mate SE but buyer beware on this phone especially if you're on At&t's network !!!"
B078NCL7GK,dustyman042004,4,It's not a bad device for what it offers cameras decent battery is a swell decent will get you through a whole day screen is good you why is not very resource dependence it's been said that it will receive 8.0 Oreo per honor I would recommend
B078NCL7GK,michelle sundstrom,4,"Is a very nice device, but beware. You need a screenprotector. Whenever i put the phone in the pocket if my jeans, the screan gains little tiny scratches and some bigger scratches past the middle of the screen."
B078NCL7GK,Ricardo Cabrera,1,"Itâs a decent phone for what you pay for it. I purchased the phone to upgrade my personal HTC Desire during Amazon Prime Day. I have an iPhone for work so donât use my personal phone too often. It does what I need it to do, make calls, send messages, read my email and surf the net. It also takes decent pictures.

It does get boggy and unresponsive at times. I have to remind myself to make sure I hard exit any apps Iâve been on. Sometimes the keyboard doesnât react when you are trying to type. I have issues connecting Google Maps to my Ford Fusion. I can connect the calling feature with no issues.

I would recommend the phone if you need the basics and donât want to get into a long lease with a major carrier.

Update:
I am updating my review to a single star. For the last week I have not been able to receive or send any MMS messages. I called my carrier, T Mobile and they werenât able to help me. It is not an authorized phone for them so they do not have any specs for it. Iâm going to try Hauwei next. But everything Iâve read online they are no help."
B078NCL7GK,robert paulsen,4,"Past phones: Moto droid, droid x, droid x2 droid razor, S5, V20, Note 5, Note 7, Moto G5, and some other low end phones. Nothing beats the note 7 before it was bricked though.
I am really impressed with the phone for several reasons.
PRO:
The phone construction is great, camera is better than expected for a low level phone (about the same as the S5, but not as good as the Note7 or V20 and better than the others listed above), button feel is perfect, color is as advertised, screen looks good and the brightness level is way better than expected and much brighter than my Moto G4, speaker volume is very loud, but tonaly quality isn't that great but not as bad as others I have had. I really like the overlay of the gui and the options for customization are close to flagship level and equal or better than other big brands I have had. Response time of the processor is good and not a let down, the 3 gig ram seems fine for the phone also. Battery life is great and closely 30% longer lasting than the G4 I still have. The real surprise is the fingerprint sensor and how well it perfectly and instantly recognises several programed fingers. The Note7 was a joke in comparison .

CONS:
What I dislike is the fact the touch screen anywhere around the edges is kinda iffy, not really responsive at all. Using it as a hotspot is worthless as the speed is a joke and not even capable of playing youtube vids at a 240p setting. I still have 2 other working phones for a direct network comparo and this phone just sucks for use as a hotspot. My only SLIGHTLY MINOR COMPLAINT, is that this thing is slippery! lol Good thing they included the slim fitting, great quality cover/case for it. Given the battery life the last complaint is that it isn't a fast charging phone at all, but being that it needs charged less often that other phones I can still get a 12.5hr work day out of it before it dies. I have not charged it for 2 days on my days off, so the battery life is great in general, but having the turbo charge that other phones offer is still lacking on this phone. Again, just a minor con.

Overall:
I really like it and would buy it again if needed, but the lack of it being a hotspot is a big issue for me, as I used my last 2 phones a lot for this as my home wifi blows in some rooms and could use the phone to stream through the pc, smart tv, and the roku with ease for netflix movies. This phone just completely fails in that regard. Because of this I am wanting to give it 3 stars, but as it works so well in all other areas I will gift it an extra star and give it a 4."
B078NCL7GK,Lena,5,"I love Honor. I had an Honor5 before and it was great and this one really doesn't dissapoint. Great features & performance for an affordable price. In addition, the chance to carry 2 SIM cards at the same time really comes in handy when you're travelling and you want to have a local line."
B078NCL7GK,Oswaldo Zelaya,3,"I usually don't write review for products however i feel compelled to write one for this phone. First of all if you buy this phone for the camera, don't do it as it is terrible. I use the camera of my phone daily for work i have to send reports and at least good pictures, in the past i had a camera for this purpose, however as cellphone cameras became better and better this was not necessary until this phone. The previous phone i had was a Xiaomi Mi4C and it was a great phone for its price range of about 150 bucks the detail on that camara was far superior to this one and it was supposed to be worse in paper. The dual camera is a good gimmick for Facebook pictures with simulated out of focus areas but that's about it, if you want detailed pictures this is not a good phone, specially for macro. Also the colors are off
Now on to the rest of the phone its alright i guess, good memory. The sound is really low. It feels sturdy."
B078NCL7GK,jennifer shotton,5,"I bought this as a replacement for my old Google Nexus 5 and have had it for about a month now. The phone is great value for money and seems to do everything better+faster than my old one. Based on my experience with a Samsung tablet, I was expecting a ton of bloatware compared to the pure Android implementation of the Nexus but I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case. A few popular apps that I don't use, Facebook and Instigram, we're pre-installed but I was able to delete these easily. I use it with Tmobile and it works great."
B078NCL7GK,Melissa,1,"The phone is great but the customer service and warranty sucks. Manufacture warranty covets up to a year. Ive had the phone for 4 months, the screen cracks and they won't cover it. Extremely pissed off"
B078NCL7GK,Skywalker,5,This is Nice Phone with Cool extra Features and it doesn't come whit all junk bloatware that AT&T store Phones come with
B078NCL7GK,Rafael Garcia-Leyva,5,So far my 2 daughters are very happy and sattisfied with their new cel phones. It seems that fits the specs as promised. Long long lasting battery and great quality and sharp screen. Need to purchase a good screen protector because the ones I ordered for the two phones were of a terrible quality and I lost my money.
B078NCL7GK,hptruman,5,"I love this phone, Sleek, great photos, only complaint, the volume is not as loud as I would like."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"This phone is absolutely amazing! I love how fast it processes, the beautiful screen, amazing picture quality, excellent voice quality on calls. The battery is stellar... I usually only have to charge it every other day, but I rarely stream video or play intense games. I highly recommend this phone, especially for the price - it can't be beat!"
B078NCL7GK,Osafo Sam,5,"To anyone who is considering to buy this pone. I am telling you this, it is a steal, it is a catch. Do not hesitate or think twice to buy it. This phone is so awesome!"
B078NCL7GK,MrsB,1,"My camera keeps freezing up, pages will freeze up. Not truly happy with the phone but will do until I can afford a better one. Some apps either lock up or won't come on at all. This phone is not worth buying"
B078NCL7GK,Michael,5,"I've had this phone for about 24 hours, and it has exceeded all of my expectations. I am coming from an iPhone 5S, so the large and beautiiful screen alone makes this phone worth the $200 investment. The software is clean and the build quality is similar to phones that are triple the price. Also, the phone came with a nice clear case. While the camera is not perfect, it has many adjustable settings and is more than suitable for my needs. If you are tired of spending way too much on cell phones, this phone is for you."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Amazing phone for the price. You could just feel the quality. It has double cameras, and a fingerprint sensor. Thats great for a phone this price, I highly recommend this phone if your on a budget!"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Bought this for my wife. It replaces her Honor 5X, which we really liked when we bought it. Just proves to me that I can buy a really good phone without spending $500 +. It does everything she needs and more, and it does it fast."
B078NCL7GK,Bookaholics Bookshelf Reviews,5,"So far I am loving my new phone! My only issue is that I can't connect the data. That, however, is more of a provider issue that it is an issue with the phone. It has so many bells and whistles that I may spend the rest of my life just trying to make heads or tails of them. It has more to offer than anything!!!!!"
B078NCL7GK,Analyst,5,"A nice fast good looking cellphone at a reasonable price. Does everything I need. I do not do games on a phone as I use it for making calls, browsing the internet, messaging and emails. I am not big on cameras though the one provided seems to be perfectly adequate.Its not an iPhone X or a Galaxy S8 but who cares."
B078NCL7GK,Salvador ortiz,1,This phone is terrible.. TERRIBLE. if you like torturous lag buy this ASAP.
B078NCL7GK,The Rain,1,I was one of the first to purchase this phone. Excited at first butt now regret my purchase. I have problem with the touch screen not acknowledge my touch to start an app. Like answering my phone or to start Shazam to get the title of a song before it stop playing. Download speed with my cell phone provider.
B078NCL7GK,azb,5,Saw I a great side by side comparison on the 7x and 6x on youtube by RamdonFix did a very detailed video about this phone. I'm glad I purschased it. NO COMPLAINTS
B078NCL7GK,kamil,5,I'm one of the first ones on here to hav it and I love it especially the 18:9 screen it makes it look bigger then the last phone I had which was the zte blade v8 pro and they even gave me a free case so it's a win win
B078NCL7GK,Micah,5,"Great product for the price you pay. Has many great features not available in phones at this price point. If you would like to see my full unboxing and first impressions of this product go check out my youtube video on it: ""Honor 7x | Unboxing and First Impressions"" channel name is Tech Sumo!"
B078NCL7GK,DR,4,Great for the price!
B078NCL7GK,Christina Deems,4,Great phone so far for what the price was. Awesome screen. Hope it lasts long.
B078NCL7GK,Kim Neumann,5,Phone meets all expectations. It is well made mid range phone. Have only one week and everything works well. Only gripe is no USB c. My last phone had it.
B078NCL7GK,adathan,2,"This seems like an incredible phone, but the version I received wouldn't work on AT&T - AT&T even sent me a new sim card in case it was something to do with my existing sim. But when they put the phone's serial number into the system, it showed up as linked to Verizon and not actually unlocked. Giving it 2 stars simply because the phone itself seems high quality, but I will have to return it."
B078NCL7GK,e123,1,"Worse unlock phone I have got from Amazon thus far , this phone is slow this phone does not respond to touch very well this phone's camera only works half the time and when it does it is so slow to respond this is not a good phone for the money"
B078NCL7GK,Sarah,5,"Such a cool phone!! I was really worried about the SIM card situation but it transferred seamlessly!! My last phone was a Galaxy Express 3, so this is an upgrade. Love the customizability. Only drawbacks SO FAR: phone charges SO SLOWLY and is heating up, but that's probably because of how much I'm using it. It has such cool features and I'm excited to have such a great phone"
B078NCL7GK,Sally,5,Very good
B078NCL7GK,Ajaydeep Sidhu,1,"Don't buy this phone if you are going to use snapchat, Instagram or camera on this phone. this phone is very slow and freezes when ever you need it the most. i restart this phone few times a day to use it. phone goes crazy when it freeze and their is no way you will survive a day without restarting. this phone is not for kids, i would say this phone is only worth it for old people due to big screen and long life battery."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,For the price is a amazing mobile
B078NCL7GK,MITSCIENTIST,3,"Good: decent price, large screen, comes with a transparent sleeve, nice color, try to get version with larger RAM
Bad: a bit slow with latest android update
Ugly: 16 Megapixel camera is not as good as my note 4."
B078NCL7GK,Chris,5,I opened the Box and fell in love with this phone. The phone is fast great quality beautiful to look at and all around just a great phone. I recommend this phone for people on a budget or looking for something different.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,"I purchased two of these phones, one for myself and one for my wife. Both phones freeze up constantly when more than one app is running. We find ourselves rebooting the phones around 4 times per day."
B078NCL7GK,M Rod,1,"At first the phone works good but after the second month, phone screen went blank. Have to wait for 20 mintue for phone to start working again. It's driving me crazy. Worse phone."
B078NCL7GK,Rw J.,1,Phone had too many bugs. I see all the awesome reviews maybe I just had a bad unit. My biggest problem was no matter what I sat the screen time out to it shut off in 10 seconds.
B078NCL7GK,Bryan Woody,4,"This is a great phone for the price, no regrets here. My use case for a phone is GPS, messaging, email, quick reference on the web, quick reminder photos, etc. So I'm not exactly a power user.

Pros:
Price
Fairly Recent security updates.
Fingerprint sensor works fast, reliably.
Battery life is great.
Dual SIM

Cons:
A little sluggish sometimes, not too bad though. Not a phone for gamers.
Camera is a bit meh, but again refer to price.
Only 2.4GHz Wireless support"
B078NCL7GK,Deb in PA,4,"Long time Apple gal, first time Android user. So far so good, better than expected even, with the exception of iMessage and multimedia bugs that I think are more fruit based than Huawei or Googles fault. I don't love the security news, don't love being even more inside Big G's ecosystem, but the $800 still in my pocket are too important in my budget for me to be a chooser."
B078NCL7GK,Brandon Laddon,3,Two months with phone. Placed it up for sale on Craigslist yesterday. Like size screen colors. Don't like the processor. My cracked up galaxy j7 feels faster to touch and to do just about everything. This phone was clearly what I needed to let me know I need more than a 3g memory mid-low snapdragon processor set up. Worst: laggy camera. Won't miss this phone.
B078NCL7GK,James Brown,4,"I do like the phone but the size is just too large for me. I have the Honor 5X and love it, which is why I bought the 7X. Great phone but again, for me it's just too large."
B078NCL7GK,Krystal,4,"Phone is great. Much better than wasting $700 on a Galaxy or iPhone. Screen breaks easy though. I just dropped it lightly with a screen protector on, and the screen cracked, covering the front lens :("
B078NCL7GK,Osiricat,4,"Great deal for the price, its fast, good image quality, the only negative point = is a little bit bulky/heavy, but I am very pleased with the phone"
B078NCL7GK,alcoholicjedi,1,"First.
Out of the Box. The GPS on this is highly inaccurate. It would ""drift"" upwards of a half mile away. It would never steadily track my location from the moment I turned the phone on. I factory reset the phone twice nothing fixed this. Also I'm located in New York City...this isn't pennsyltucky or the amazon river basin. I also set the GPS onto all 3 different settings (GPS only, wifi + gps, cell+wifi+gps) still...massive issues driving or using running apps. this phone in particular is discouraged by major running apps like strava for this exact issue (amongst others like the battery optimization garbage which i also turned off).

second. water resistance is horrible on this phone. i was caught in the rain. phone had a case on. i got pretty wet, that's fair but rather than the usb port being damaged or condensation in the camera the SIM CARD PORT someone stopped functioning? Sim card has one of those trays and is located 3-4 mm into the phone. ""Water Damage"" voided my warranty despite the phone becoming useless due to a sim port issue. I no longer could use my cellular network, otherwise phone was working as normal.

third. the screen is very cheap. mine cracked while in my jeans as i was sitting down. the stress of denim fabric apparently bent the phone just enough to crack the screen. i wear some tight jeans, i'll admit, but this has never happened before with any other phone, including larger ones.

i, like everyone who reads this, have owned a lot of cellphones. the issues i had with this one were especially bad.

I'd highly recommend a moto-g or LG aristo for simple budget phones that won't end up costing you MORE money like this Hew-way honor."
B078NCL7GK,Wasique W.,2,"Amazing mid range phone with a budget price, but ilte does not work on the freedom mobile network in Canada. I checked the bands 4 and 7 for this phone before purchasing, and both are supported by freedom. So frustrated by this since hspa speeds are very slow and honor tech support is not replying back"
B078NCL7GK,M. Kaplan,5,"The screen is quite clear, the speed respectable, the fingerprint reader surprisingly accurate and the overall execution amazing at is price point."
B078NCL7GK,Katherina,3,"It's a beautiful phone but unfortunately it freezes a lot. I can not have several apps open because it stops working correctly, either freezing or getting very slow."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"I really enjoyed buying this phone. Nothing to gripe about because you can simply change your launcher. As for the bloatware, almost all of it can be disabled or moved to an SD card.

Overall 5/5 would buy again. I recommend this phone for anyone who is on a bit of a budget but still needs power and customization."
B078NCL7GK,Denis,5,No brainer for $200.
B078NCL7GK,Corrina R.,1,Don't buy this phone within in 6 weeks the charger port and fingerprint sensor broke. Even after contacting manufacturer no help. Save your money
B078NCL7GK,james c.,5,"my brother has one it pretty good in most of its feature but the screen is easily crack if u drop it to often, if ur getting this don't get it from this seller very poor service on refund and inspection also cheap and non flexible depend on whats was done to their product,20% percent for restocking the only thing touch was but the tape for 20% this is what i call rigged, good phone just don't get it from this seller"
B078NCL7GK,KingKhan,5,"Amazing phone for the price. Biggest issue is the screen is sometimes not responsive. Also the phone tends to slow down significantly if your multitasking, that issue is resolved if you access developer options and turn off animations etc..."
B078NCL7GK,Tyler Devore,5,This phone is excellent. It has a nice size screen and the camera is excellent quality. I notice a few bugs in the software but nothing major considering it is a cheap Android phone. For the price it definitely can compete with major phones.
B078NCL7GK,Allen Dierolf,5,Fast and user friendly . Much better than I anticipated
B078NCL7GK,J3rish(ish),3,Just dont open too many apps at once :/
B078NCL7GK,joeh,3,Very good. Except that Bluetooth is somewhat quirky. Eg. Fitbit will not connect.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,I have never written a bad review on Amazon because 99% of the time I'm very happy with what I get or I exchange it without issue! This phone is a disaster freezes every 5 minutes opens up applications without me touching them calls and dials random people this phone sucks big time you get what you pay for and this is trash
B078NCL7GK,Yue Weng,3,"I have had the phone for 4 months now. Battery life is not as good. I don't use the phone that much, but still need to charge it almost every day."
B078NCL7GK,Noah K.,5,"Great phone I loved it unfortunately had to send it back because it would not work on straight talk for me. I called and called and the BYOP service doesnât work with it. Just a heads up. Sad I had to send it back, for me itâs better than my iPhone 7. The back camera is amazing the front is still an android camera. Never lagged or froze on me. Great phone 10/10-ign"
B078NCL7GK,Jeffrey Eaton,1,"-EDIT-
After exactly 1 month(Product arrived Jan 27, today is Feb 27), the phone is bricked. I was just listening to spotify, heard a notification go off, so I tried to unlock screen to view my message. The screen wouldn't cut on. I pressed the power button a few more times, eventually it cut on for a brief second and then just cut off again. I figured it was just being slow, so I opted to restart the phone. When the phone turned on, it constantly goes to the EMUI eRecovery page, which always fails to update to fix my phone. As of now, my phone is bricked and unusable. I've heard that flashing the stock firmware might work? I don't know much about that stuff, but from what I understand, Huawei doesn't normally make their stock firmware public for months after release and I cannot go months without a phone due to the nature of my work. I essentially just have a $200 paperweight now.

--OLD REVIEW--
Absolutely love it. Phone lasts 3-4 days with light usage, day and a half with constant usage(Such as hours and hours of Netflix, or some light gaming) Only reason it isn't a 5-star, isn't necessarily a fault of the 7x, it's more-so a feature of theirs that doesn't like to work with Android well. The 18:9 screen, while excellent, imo, for viewing pleasures, the screen sometimes acts a little weird and doesn't register me pressing a button, so I have to double tap every once in a while. Not a huge problem, imo, however. I can live with that, overall, I love the phone."
B078NCL7GK,Vanessa,3,"I've never had a more glitchy, laggy phone. It's beautiful, thin, light, and does what it's supposed to -- about 75% of the time. But the constant freezing up and various glitches, which weren't present in those same apps on a different Huawei phone, are just too frustrating to put up with."
B078NCL7GK,Anna B.,5,"Just received this phone yesterday and it's awesome! It's slim but still heavy, feels durable and the screen is clear and goes all the way to the edge of the phone so it's not a clunky phone, feels good in your hand. Switched my cricket Sim card over with easy no problem. It's fast and the camera is great! Definitely worth the$$ ðð"
B078NCL7GK,Gwendolyn D.,4,"This is a great phone, I have no complaints!"
B078NCL7GK,MICHELLE,5,So far I'm loving this phone. Will update review if need be
B078NCL7GK,Valentine BAY,5,everyone need a back up phone
B078NCL7GK,Thomas Burton,3,"The good. It looks and feels good in the hand battery life is great. I May still return it. I have 7 more days i believe. The CPU bottlenecks more than i'd like. Messages have to be downloaded in mms which i've tried to fix 1000 different ways clearing the cache sometimes helps. Sometimes it doesn't, i can't seem to figure out why it does this. Then when it says you need to download the message it will fail. It has restarted a few times. I also have a video of it locking up or bottle necking. This was out of a lock screen nothing was running in the back ground. I could understand if it was over loaded. It does not like nova launcher. There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike. Everything is up to date on the phone. I just think i might have not hit the silicone lottery with this one and the CPU in mine just isn't up to pair with the rest of the honor 7x's. I'll give it until over the weekend and see if i can work out the quarks if not i'm going to send it back. I want it to be a good phone."
B078NCL7GK,Steven,4,Great phone for the price. Occasionally call quality is less than other phones Iâve had in the past. Easy to switch from iPhone.
B078NCL7GK,Delly .,1,"DISAPPOINTED
DOESN'T WORTH BUYING FOR $ð¯"
B078NCL7GK,Shorty,5,he likes it!!!!
B078NCL7GK,busboy,5,Solid phone. Like this $200 phone better better than my $800 Samsung S8+!
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,"I didn't read in reviews of Honor 7X the exclusive use of nano sim but discovered NANO SIM ONLY which would require purchasing $25.00 nano sim thereby wiping out the Prime Day savings ... unfortunately, will return and seek another replacement that uses micro sim."
B078NCL7GK,61rambler,4,Pleasantly surprised and very happy with this phone read a lot of reviews before we purchased
B078NCL7GK,YiuWai Ha,5,Awesome phone. I highly recommend it.
B078NCL7GK,Meriel,5,"Working great. It a mid range cellphone, so it will not have all the specification of a P10 Plus, but it works for a person that like to have a lots of app with running low of storage."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Great phone, totally recommend!
The thing is, it is a mix of IPhone and Android phones. Many of its features are copied off of IPhone, yet it is still Android like. I totally love this mix. Works great! Also, it's cheap! Cheap iPhone) Good phone!"
B078NCL7GK,loy,3,I had another Huawei before this and issue I had was only one speaker worked. Another was stolen and my current one has an issue with the touch screen. I have to tap more twice before it works. Does anyone else have similar issues.
B078NCL7GK,Isaiah Cox,4,"Freezes with heavy app usage. Otherwise, the functionality and design exceeds some flagship phones. Signal strength is very strong. Overall, good product."
B078NCL7GK,B. Styles,4,"Good battery, quick fingerprint (Faster than iPhone). Gets the job done."
B078NCL7GK,Jenelle,4,Phone working good so far. Only problem is mine have horizontal lines on the screen for some reason.
B078NCL7GK,JMO,2,When sending texts with gifs this phone is very bad
B078NCL7GK,An anonymous person,5,"this is a great phone and a few days ago, i dropped it into a swimming pool and after a day of drying, its back to normal"
B078NCL7GK,Nikki,1,Picture looks good but slow
B078NCL7GK,paul,5,"Replaced an iPhone 5S, and this is a massive upgrade. Truly a budget phone that can compete with flagship phones."
B078NCL7GK,Crystal,1,"I really love this phone so far. My one complaint is when I try to touch things that are really close to the edge of the screen, I sometimes have to touch it several times before it will finally sense that I am touching the screen. Annoying yes, deal breaker, no.

Update 4/4/2018
Well, I have had this phone for a month and there is a small crack on the side of the screen already!! I am not happy."
B078NCL7GK,TV,5,Thank you!!!
B078NCL7GK,Austin Dunaway,3,"It's an okay phone, but it freezes up a lot, and the System crashes. The camera is awesome though."
B078NCL7GK,Brandon Stoutamire,5,"This phone is super underrated... It's amazing in every aspect. I'll do a full review, but now I'm being lazy.
If you are a selfie person, this phone is for you."
B078NCL7GK,antony,5,"It works with T mobile, has Wi Fi phone feature , 4g LTE and worth every penny spend ."
B078NCL7GK,Washington Cavalcante,5,"I will give a five star for the price! Its a not flagship phone, so I cant expect much from it. The screen resolution is great! Good battery. It gets a bit slow after intense use."
B078NCL7GK,Vadim Sedletsky,1,"The phone lags like crazy, brand new - tried everything - flashed everything, installed latest OS update - LAG like hell.
No support - nothing to do.

Will not recommend to anyone even for a budget phone."
B078NCL7GK,Rasheed Khan Mohammed,5,"Great phone at great price! You cannot go wrong with your decision.
Pros:
- Solid built
- Great screen and screen size
- Speakers are of decent volume (for a $200 standpoint)
- Very slim
The biggest peace of mind is, I am spending only $200 for such a great phone and if I loose or break - who cares!"
B078NCL7GK,tomas a gaspar,5,For that price is a great phone....
B078NCL7GK,brandon,5,"Great Phone! I thought since it was a Chinese phone that it would be alright but its more than that, and for 200 dollars just cant beat it."
B078NCL7GK,Hedonist8,1,Charges super slow and apps are slow sometimes
B078NCL7GK,Valentin Krassinev,5,I'm comletly satisfied with the device. It entirely met my expectations.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"What I liked:
Best display available for the price at the time of this review. The proprietary Emui interface is really pretty and works like a charm. Split screen functionality is super useful. Fingerprint sensor works perfectly.
Build quality feels amazing. Metal body feels like a much more expensive phone.
Super slim

What I don't like:
The speaker is terrible. I had read other reviews that mentioned this and thought nothing of it, but it's really tinny sounding, no bass at all. It's a bigger deal than I thought it would be.
There are no great screen protectors for this phone! Not sure why. Best I've found so far is a skinomi TechSkin.
The only other issues are the sorts of things you expect on a $200 phone.
No USB-C
No fast charging
Not as much RAM as I'd like
Etc.
As I said no real issues yet, just budget level everything.

CONCLUSION:
Great phone for the price. Probably the best sub $500 phone available."
B078NCL7GK,BT,1,After 4 months. My GPS of this phone stopping working .
B078NCL7GK,Jose Gonzalez,2,"So far I am unhappy with the phone. My previous experience with Huawei had been pleasant, but this phone is far away from that. It keeps lagging, screen does not response as quick as my previous Xiaomi Red Mi Note 3. The fact of not having physical buttons is a aesthetic pkus, but the ""on screen buttons"" aint as responsive as I think they should.

Maybe all my concerns are software related. I hope Huawei can fix them, otherwise I will foind my self using this a brick for papers."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,So far so good

B078NCL7GK,gerald,4,Great but 4 stars. It bent in my pocket. My fault I know.. but it did so ya..
B078NCL7GK,LU YAN,2,"I had the 7x brand new and 3 weeks later it suddenly went to a reboot cycle, the phone keeps showing booting screen and was stuck in it, had to contact Huawei service center and get it send in for repair, I'm disappointed at the build quality even though the phone is really nice to use."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"Nice screen, great battery. Very slow and lags frequently."
B078NCL7GK,Bolterman,5,Easily the best phone I have ever owned in that price range!
B078NCL7GK,Desmond Anderson,5,"This phone is great, get it before it's too late."
B078NCL7GK,zeru,1,"This phone has less than a month with me ,I have never had this kind of invaluable phone in my life,I strongly recommend to any one don't trash your money it is totally worthless ."

B078NCL7GK,Wei Lin,4,Phone a little slow but good for $200. I am using a galaxy s8+ .This phone is a gift . Phone feels slow but cant complain because its so cheap .
B078NCL7GK,Minh Bui,4,The led is crisp and look really amazing. Audio isnt as loud as the other phone. I give it a 4 star because i was expecting it to me full screenled.
B078NCL7GK,Oren N,5,Good and Proactive Cell.. cost effective phone.
B078NCL7GK,Michael Brown,1,"Really hate this phone! I really hate the fact that you can't move apps to the SD card because the manufacture disable this function in their modified version of android. This is so you can buy a phone with much more storage space. This phones and phones that disable the ability to moved apps to the SD card are made for manufacture profits and not consumers needs. On many occasions when I talking on the phone the person I'm talking to can't hear me. I have to put the phone on speaker or Blu-tooth (if I can get it to connect). I have the hardest time connecting Blu-tooth devices. At this present time none of my Blu-tooth headphone will connect. The camera and video playback are ok.
This phone came pre-installed with a bunch of crappy apps that take up unnecessary space. I paid over 200$ for this lousy phone because I thought I was getting a decent cellphone. Now I have to purchased another phone because this one can't do its main function which is to allow me to talk on it. It you need a cellphone stay away from this one! Get a Samsung or a iPhone."
B078NCL7GK,VAGHARSHAK,5,It's very kind device! Thanks for all.
B078NCL7GK,Dr. T,2,"Looks nice. Snappy in some areas. However, the processor is the deal breaker. Many times, even though it's new, launching the camera takes 15+ seconds. Imagine how that might affect the moment. Additionally, app to app transition has frozen the phone a few times already. Thankfully Amazon.com is exceptional and I'm sending this back after 3 weeks of use. Sometimes you get high function on the cheap. Not this time.

Update: limping through my last night before I ship this phone back. I'm reducing to 2/5. The lag is beyond unacceptable."
B078NCL7GK,chardaebarkley,5,"Nice phone, I love it"
B078NCL7GK,LamarDaley,5,E Good
B078NCL7GK,David M,2,I had high expectations for this phone due to the specs but it turned out to be disappointing it has a nice screen and other features you find on high end phones but the phone seemed slow and lagged when pressing the screen. I ended up returning the phone. Maybe I just got a defective one but I would not recommend it. For this price point your better off with a Sony experia
B078NCL7GK,Kenton Chatman,5,Great phone
B078NCL7GK,sunnyfan,5,good
B078NCL7GK,Andrew Brown,3,Pro -Love the look and feel of the phone. Cons- no 5ghz wifi only 2.4ghz. has a 5 bar scale for data/phone reception yet on average 3 bars but mostly 2 and even 1!! Very disappointed in the antenna ! I'm with Virgin Mobile which runs on the Bell Network in Canada and Bells coverage is all over. On an LTE service yet doesn't help ...needs to have better hardware
B078NCL7GK,Mile-hi boarder,4,"Update (6-27-18)

This was a 1 star review, every issue I was experiencing was fixed by the recently released Oreo update. It's quick but not blazing fast like some of the popular flagship phones. I'm happy with my purchase, ..finally!

The phone is slow and lags, can take up to 20 seconds for the camera app to launch. I've done a complete reinstall, faster memory, and cleared the cache multiple times. I've reached out to Huwaei and they sent an automated email with useless suggestions. A quick search on the internet will backup my claim.

The Moto offered but Amazon is smaller and has a huge bezel that I really don't care for but zero issues in 7-8 months. I'm taking it out of the drawer and going back, I should have never purchased this phone."
B078NCL7GK,Sergio Solo,1,"It's hard for me to recommend this device, with so many issues i had, I know it's probably bad luck for me, but I had heard so many good things from honor that I was willing to try.

The phone, the hardware is great, it's hard to believe this is a ""budget"" phone, premium and with great specs, but on the other hard, the software experience is really bad, I would love this product if this would be offered on an Android Go/One Version

As for my ""real issue"", my phone came defective, screen kept turning off for 30 seconds to 1 min, had to lock it and unlock it a bunch of time, I thought I didn't knew how to use it, since i came from iOS, but then eventually it turned off and wouldn't turn on back, I thought it was the battery but when I receive a call and the screen was blank , while the phone ringing , I knew i had to ask for a refund.

If you get it, and it works great for you, I believe you, it was just not for me"
B078NCL7GK,Andrew johnson,1,"The phone looks and is made very well. It's a shame that the phone is so slow and laggy taking a picture is nearly impossible. This is the slowest, laggiest phone I have ever used. I will be returning. Unless mine is defective. Which I doubt."
B078NCL7GK,Joseph Michael Mills,3,"I have trouble streaming live TV. The stream is choppy. I put my old phone side-by-side and streamed the same TV program simultaneously, the infinix continued to stream while the honor chopped up the video. The phone is a problem to me. Short battery life. It does not wanna play wma files. It does not recognize them as audio files. Plays mp3 just fine. Good technical support."
B078NCL7GK,Lennae Varlinsky,1,You cannot easily remove the battery to reset or replace. Even the repair shop had a hard time and cracked the screen. The Honor app for customer support does not work in the US. When the phone was working fine... It was fine. Once anything starts to go wrong (cracked screen in my case)... The phone is useless and costs a lot to fix if it can even be fixed.
B078NCL7GK,Mike K,2,"While the phone is great in general, the one we bought had a major speaker issue. Even at half volume, sound coming from the speaker was garbled. If you turn up the volume, it is almost not comprehensible. This is pretty unacceptable since we cannot use the speaker to watch any videos or speak on the phone. We are returning the phone."
B078NCL7GK,Greg deaf,1,Purchased this phone because it was suppose to be water resistent. I accidently dropped it in a small puddle. It worked for 3 hours and then died on me. This phone is not water proof.
B078NCL7GK,Alvaro,4,"When it has more of 10 apps open it gets very very slow and you have to close all the apps for the phone to come to normal speed again, but in general its beatiful, has good cameras, screen and a very resistant body for the price"
B078NCL7GK,Paul,5,Best packaging and fast shipping by Amazon Prime. This phone is the Real Budget King. Super Fluid and best budget dual Camera!!!!!
B078NCL7GK,Rodger B. Terrey,5,Nice but make sure you have a nano SIM card I really wanted it to work for me . but not in the Stars
B078NCL7GK,Jose Sarmiento,3,its a great phone exept the times it becomes sluggish and slow out of nowhere wich is sadly pretty often.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,It looks like it is a fabulous phone but I cannot use it. Thanks Honor 7x doesn't accept my Total wireless plan. ð
B078NCL7GK,Daniel M.,3,I prefer a larger phone. Second SIM reception is subpar
B078NCL7GK,VJ,4,Nice phone with all new features. Slim and sleek
B078NCL7GK,KEYVAN HANNANI,1,"Nice looking phone but I couldn't use it with Verizon service.
Could not make or receive phone calls."
B078NCL7GK,MATT,5,"Nothing to envy to a way more expensive pone like the IPhone, great screen, easy to use and amazing prize."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"I lke the big screen, but the unit is weak in transmission"
B078NCL7GK,AA,1,"This phone seems kind of... broken? There's huge lag whenever I try to do anything with it (Press a button? Wait a couple of seconds for that to register. Want to switch between apps? More waiting). It doesn't stop playing music when someone calls me, apps keep crashing on it, and it generally seems buggy and slow. Pretty disappointing."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,Terrible camera.
B078NCL7GK,Smakman,1,Mine is junk. Constant hangups. Have to restart 2-3 times per day. Sending it back for refund.
B078NCL7GK,Brittany wood,1,Freezes constantly has constant advertisement making it almost impossible to open
B078NCL7GK,Richard Huang,1,This is a piece of trash. Crashes on a daily basis. Very frustrating. Don't buy it just because it looks cool. Might as well buy an iPhone 6s instead of this garbage.
B078NCL7GK,Pablo Gallardo,5,"Just Great cellphone the only thing i did not like its the speaker, and charge port are bottom of cellphone"
B078NCL7GK,Donovan Broadus,4,"For what you're getting for $200 is amazing. So far, I've enjoyed the phone, but I've experienced some lag when running multiple applications. Very random, but Snapchat is almost unusable on this phone. It will lock the entire phone up, and will require a reboot at times.

The cameras are decent. No issues. Battery life is amazing. Screen is extra sharp and vibrant. My real only complaint might be the 3gb of RAM in the US variant I have.

I will give it maybe another week to see if I can deal with the lag, or if it subsides. It started lagging while writing this review..."
B078NCL7GK,Rigoberto,4,Slow
B078NCL7GK,Ahmed Abdullahi,3,Everything on the phone is great except the camera.
B078NCL7GK,John Quach,1,"Was an awesome phone until system update, caused touch screen to become unresponsive at times, having to press harder and longer in order to get it to work. So disappointed."
B078NCL7GK,Michael Davidson,3,"FALSE ADVERTISING!
They claim the phone is unlocked.

Honor 7X - 18:9 screen ratio, 5.93"" full-view display. Dual-lens camera. Unlocked Smartphone, Black (US Warranty

I received mine and immediately discovered it is NOT UNLOCKED. I paid for what was described and I was lied to. You decide whether you want the phone but know this, it will be locked. it will NOT be rooted. You will NOT have root access!"
B078NCL7GK,Patrick,1,"This phone has been terrible. Constantly lagging and locking up. I had hoped a recent update would have solved the issues, but no better. I find myself having to clear running apps constantly and apps and screen touches take forever to respond most of the time. If I could give a zero star rating I would do so."
B078NCL7GK,20th Century Arber,1,"Got this phone for a replacement phone from an 6X... screens blew apart on two of them within days from small drops. These were small drops. Literally less than a 12 inch drop as it slid out of my pocket on the first one and the 2nd one equally small. Clumsy yes but, had it in a case... had the screen protector and shattered. The 6X was a beast and I have them for my sons as well as had one for me. I did order the insurance on the 2nd unit and will wait to try and see how that process works..."
B078NCL7GK,RoMoney,4,"The shipping is longer than expected but the phone is definitely the best in the budget segment some drawbacks include the micro usb, occasional lag due to the outdated processor being used and no 4glte only 2g mobile data."
B078NCL7GK,Juan Z.,1,"The phone looks and feels amazing, my prev phone was a Galaxy S6, all the good reviews made me buy the honor BUT after two days of use the phone started to freeze up and not work. Most of the time you switch to the camera it will crash or it will take forever to load, making you change your mind about taking a pic in the first place. The phone would crashed at least 3 times per day, way too much in my opinion. I got the one with the 3GB ram so maybe the good reviews go towards the 4GB ram. I replaced it with a MOTO phone and Im loving it"
B078NCL7GK,Ralph W.,1,its ok phone but after a week of using it is laggy and camera not working good.. maybe a heavy ui. return it today not satisfied with the phone. i dont know why those youtube reviewer got impressed with this phone and a lot of people returning it. maybe they are paid by huawei to make the phone lok good
B078NCL7GK,Nicolas Freeland,1,"Loved the Honor 5x. It was my first Honor phone. I expected the 7x to be at least as good. The Honor 7x had been nothing but problematic for me. To be clear the phone works great as an Android platform but is unreliable as an actual phone. After trying two att carriers h2o and straight talk and multiple days of tech support for each no one knows what's causing calls to be missed, calls straight to voicemail and delayed text messages. On top of this having Bluetooth on significantly slows wifi speeds. Unfortunately I cannot return the phone to Amazon.

Update: Was able to get phone returned to Amazon for a partial refund. I was given a bit of a runaround but it worked out after a few hours on the phone and on chat. Topping off the bad experience was Honor stating that the defect fell under a non covered article of their limited warranty."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,"I have almost no applications installed and running on this phone, and yet it still frequently freezes in OS under seemingly no load. My first Huaweai phone was the Nexus 6p and it eventually failed, and this one is seemingly turning into that same situation. I want to like Huawei as a brand, but I continually have issues with their product"
B078NCL7GK,R z,4,"Great phone for the price, however, if you can get the Global version instead of the US version get it instead. You get one more gig of ram and more storage. Consider the Xiaomi MI A1 if you could afford a sightly higher phone.

Honor 7x has a better screen, sightly bigger battery and a customizable ui skin but lacks due to having to charge via Micro Usb. The MI A1 has a smaller screen, smaller battery, but has usb c. The Honor also has a dedicated fm radio app unlike the the MI A1.

The US version has 3gigs of ram, 32gb of storage for ~$199.99, and a 5.93"" screen.
While the Mi A1 has 4gigs of ram and 64gbs of storage while being around ~$250 with around 5"" screen."
B078NCL7GK,Aymen,2,"Everything about this phone is great ,except one important thing ,the processor .The phone lags so bad ,it's almost impossible to open the camera at times .. very disappointed but it's a good phone when it isn't lagging"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,3,device is good but camera we cant imagine
B078NCL7GK,katrina a morin,1,The phone screen shattered very easily. Very expensive haven't had it six weeks and phones garage. Warranty only 30 days!
B078NCL7GK,"Talukder Alam,",1,"Only bought this bcoz the reviews said it has higher battery charge holding. Not the the case, even without any heavy use. Don't buy it if you want longer charge."
B078NCL7GK,Mike F Robbins,2,"My first impression of this phone was that itâs a great phone which rivalâs phones that cost double its price. Both the build quality and display are premium. Initially, I was a little worried about purchasing a phone with something other than stock Android on it since thatâs what my previous phone (a Nexus 5x) was running, but the EMUI interface isnât bad at all and I didnât consider it a downgrade once I used it.

The Honor 7x ships with a little bloatware installed, most of which can be removed. Some apps such as SwiftKey cannot be uninstalled, although you can set the default to the Google keyboard app instead. The phone also ships with a clear case thatâs good enough to use until you know youâre going to keep the phone.

I spent almost an entire day getting everything setup only to later discover that the Honor 7x is not compatible with Fitbit devices. It will not sync no matter what and searching for the problem reveals that everyone else with this phone is experiencing the same problem. I'm not sure if itâs a problem with the phone or Fitbit. Based on my research, both the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi share the same antenna on this phone. Anytime the phone is restarted, the Bluetooth is automatically disabled and has to be re-enabled.

Pros include a beautiful and large screen with small bezels, great performance, and premium build quality.

Cons include no NFC (used for mobile payments), no 5G Wi-Fi support, and Micro-USB instead of USB-C.

Sadly, I had to return the phone due to a lack of compatibility with my Fitbit Charge 2. My recommendation to anyone purchasing this phone is to test it with your Bluetooth devices before investing a significant amount of time configuring everything else."
B078NCL7GK,Narciso Barragan,2,"I really wanted this phone to be my replacement. Sadly it couldn't handle my day to day tasks. This phone would lag really bad when it came to social Media (Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram). But the camera was really bad. At least for my unit it was. I would take photos with natural sunlight lighting and the images would still come out washed out. I was also having mic issues with mine. People on the other side of the phone said I sounded faint or far away from my phone. When in reality my head was next to the mic. I really wanted this phone to be my current phone. But it came with too many issues. I already requested a refund and received. I don't blame the phone or the manafacturer, because it's a mid-range phone not a high end phone. I really wanted to like this phone but I couldn't."
B078NCL7GK,Nakary Gonzalez,1,"The worst purchase I could make, the phone slows down. And now in just 2 months the loudspeaker will be damaged. I do not recommend it at all."
B078NCL7GK,Daniel,1,Fraud stay away
B078NCL7GK,Tony T,5,"Hey all! I hope you all find this review super helpful: I'm going to break this review up into what I consider the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I'll reverse the order and start with the

UGLY: This phone is extremely slippery. It slips on couches, beds, tables, pretty much any surface. A case is mandatory if you want to keep this phone protected. Luckily, there is one included in the box! Because it's slippery it also gets scratched easily. I have a small crack on the front unfortunately after my 3rd week with the phone. Lastly, the charging time is unremarkable. If you ever had a Flagship phone and used quick charging you will be disappointed. This phone takes well over 2 hours to charge.

THE BAD: This phone has no NFC. Personally, not a big deal at all for me but maybe something worth noting for those who use Android payments. The software isn't like the Nokia 6.1 or Moto G6. Pretty much those phones have vanilla Android with no bloatware. This phone will have bloatware and that may/may not be a dealbreaker for you. Again, personally, I don't mind but maybe you want a smoother experience. I use Nova Launcher and I am perfectly happy. Finally, the phone looks... generic. There's nothing about this phone that stands out but then again it's super cheap!!

THE GOOD (MY FAVORITE PART!): Dat Aluminum Build quality though! Unlike my Moto G5+ (previous phone) I actually want to caress my fingers all over the brushed aluminum. It feels very cool to the touch and premium. Honestly, if I didn't know the price beforehand I would think this phone cost 2x or 3x as much! It's right up there with the iPhone 6S+. I know I just bashed this phone for being generic but the fact that this phone feels so damn premium for so little is amazing! The battery life has continued to impress me. Not sure what Huawei did but the 3340 MAH battery last easily throughout the day, I could get 40, sometimes 50% at the end of a night. And even in heavy usage, it will be at 30%. The near bezel-less display is amazing for a phone so cheap. You literally get a screen that's nearly on par with Flagships. It gives way more room for content and maximizes screen real estate. Oh, and movies and games look glorious. Tons of features!! One-handed mode, multi-window, Night Mode, double tap to wake, notification shade gesture using the fingerprint scanner, App Twin, Navigation Dock, and wayyy more. Performance is great and despite being a low-end chip I have experienced very little lag. Runs efficiently without any slowdowns. Anyone who wants a decent pic at a very affordable price is in for a surprise. After using Moto G6, Nokia 6.1, and even the Moto X4 from last year this is probably (I'm not a professional here) the best camera in its price point. Lots of filters, plenty of editing options, and the camera even have pro mode for further enhancements.

Conclusion: Even the bad things aren't deal breakers. I don't really need NFC (and I doubt any of you will). Slapping a launcher on this makes it even more customizable and smoother. The phone looking generic really doesn't matter when even most flagships struggle to stand out."
B078NCL7GK,camburger,1,I really liked the phone but within 12 hours it went into a permanent update that it never recovered from. I had to return it the next day. It was such an easy phone to use and activate. Too bad that happened.
B078NCL7GK,Herbert Sapon,4,"No long and terrible review like most of the dorks here. Here's the low down:
- Pretty screen
- Terrible wifi speed when Bluetooth is on
- The blue is sexy
- Fingerprint scanner FTW!!!

BOOM!!!"
B078NCL7GK,Bhagwan Singh,5,"I purchased directly from the Huawei Honor website, but I feel like Amazon is a large enough market and should get to hear what my experience was with the product.

In short, for the abysmally low price of $200, you will not get a better everyday phone for average media consumption. The screen is beautiful and massive. The performance, going from app to app and opening things one after another is snappy. Camera is just generically beautiful.

However, do not buy this for PRIMARILY gaming. This phone has a pretty good CPU, BUT the GPU (the hardware that makes a big impact in gaming) is quite mediocre. Now please don't think that this means it's bad phone; it's not at all. I can still play the normal, farmville-type games without any issues. It's just games like Asphalt 8 and such will be a little slow (But not unplayable, mind you).

That being said, you also need to understand that outside of gaming, the phone is spectacular. Smoother than butter, with minor glitches that any android device can have. Coming from an iPhone, I just love the amount of file management you can do on android, and with the large screen on the device, it feels like a legitimate portable ""work computer."" More so, the split screening and youtube picture in picture mode works really well, without any lag.

And good god, that fingerprint sensor is so freaking fast. It feels like the phone can sense your thoughts before you even put the finger down.
So what's the takeaway? If you're down to $200 - this phone every time. If looking specifically for a GAMING phone (primary use) - no, save the trouble and don't give the 7x a bad name. In fact, I think this is a great phone for grandparents, because if its massive screen, low cost, high performance, and the android ""simple mode"" feature along with floating docks and such."
B078NCL7GK,Ryan,4,"Overall for the price, a great experience. The battery life is generous, the camera is completely fine in the daytime, and the daily experience is good. It runs all my social media, email, and work apps just fine. The screen is perfectly fine. I'd say that the phone is aggressive in how much it dims the screen at times. If you manually turn up the brightness, it is completely visible in direct sunlight. I would say to any prospective buyers, do some things to help yourself. The stock launcher has a setting to close apps as you lock the phone. Adjust ones you frequently use to stay open. I found that making them reload from the disk vs RAM makes a big difference with commonly used apps. Make sure to use a sd card and set it as the default storage location. For the first week it seemed extremely choppy. Now it's fine. I want to have to buy a flagship out of habit but honestly... I just don't need more phone than this for what I do."
B078NCL7GK,thebarbecuemaster,5,"Great phone I waiting a month to get it on Amazon and it is worth a lot more then 199. I needed a new phone as since updating my iPhone 6s Plus that phone is resetting and really slow . I am not spending $900 on a new Apple 8 or Samsung.
I am very happy with this phone .
There is the news that huawaei phones may be spying on you that came out yesterday. Well I got news for you the NSA spies on you with the iPhone and all android phones . Verizon was going to carry this phone but was pressured not to at the last minute.
I researched this phone for 6 months before buying it.
My recommendation get it"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Wow, I bought this phone for my wife initially but it was taking longer than I wanted to wait so bought the Le Pro 3 too, it came quicker. Well I thought I was going to return this phone because I and my wife fell for the Le Pro 3 so hard, but once I played with this phone, it was over. it doesn't have as much of the little tweaks as the Le Pro 3 but it is rock solid, actually Rockstar solid. The camera is slightly better than the Pro 3, and the feel is also a little better. The UI reminds me of Nova Launcher, it is quick, has enough geek tweaks to keep me occupied for a while. I like this phone so much that I parked my Galaxy S7. The one big deal so far for me has been the slow motion movie, it is subpar, it seems to drop a couple of f stops (depending on how you view f stops) the images got super dark when I chose slow motion and the software did not recognize the beginning set point. I will reconsider if i want to take a star away for that, i will see if there is an App to address that issue ( another reason I love androids, there is generally an alternative to solve a problem).

I will update after using this while out with friends and family, but there is no way I am parting with this phone even with it's slight shortcoming."
B078NCL7GK,Jovigra,1,"Very disapointed with this phone.
I did buy two phones and both have the same ""freeze"" problems two or three times daily.
I had the Huawei Mate 8 and then the Mate 9 and they are excellent phones but no this one.
My mistake changing the Oneplus 5T for this crap."
B078NCL7GK,Inlet Sound,5,"I needed the ""best bang for the $"" and after about a month of heavy online research and reviews I decided on this 7x...
I LOVE IT!
I do not require or want the new flagship device as I just do not use a phone enough to justify $1K on a phone but I wanted a good looking phone. I am happy to repot this phone looks like a very expensive phone! The huge 18:9 screen just shouts expensive!

I needed a good camera, I needed a minimum of 32 gb and a minimum 3 gb ram so this 7x delivers.
On my 1st day of using my phone ""more than normal"" as its new, I am at 57% at the end of the evening so looks like the battery life will be great for my normal use and will give me much more than a full day.

UPDATE: I have now had the phone a few weeks and with my light to average use ( I do not live on my phone) I noticed I was on day 3, 8 hours and still had a little battery left! So I know with how I use my phone, I will never be searching for a charger!

I am on t-mobil and happy to report the phone works well ( my other phones did not as I am in a bad t-mobil location) The voice over 4G does work and the voice quality is MUCH better than any phone I have used.

T-Mobil WiFi calling does not work with this phone. I have been using T-Mobil purchased phones with T-Mobil versions of Android and or iPhones but T-Mobil WIFI calling only works on iPhones and T-Mobil devices. After searching T-mobil does have a App ( T-Mobil DIGITS) That allows calling / texting via a internet connection so I expect the WIFI calling will be a non-issue for me. I did use WIFI calling the few times I vacation in the mountains with no cell signal but now that I have a Digits app I'm okay.

This phone wifi will only do 2.4 ghz, not 5.0 ghz but I have improved my home wifi with a mesh system and I find most hotspots around town use the 2.4. My phone is very fast however when I do a wifi speed test I do not get the speed I do with a 5.0 ghz phone but the 7X phone is actually a faster phone? I would like to see dual band WIFI and I considered another brand because of only 2.4 but the other brand at this price point did not have this beautiful screen size so I am very happy I purchased this phone.

When purchasing this phone I also wanted a case and a glass screen protector, These Amazon products fit PERFECT and love them as much as the phone!Â Huawei Honor 7X case, Yuanling [Shock Resistant] Carbon Fiber Soft TPU Brushed Texture Phone case Anti-fingerprint Flexible Full-body Protective Cover For Huawei Honor 7X smartphone (Blue)

This glass protector fits PERFECT with no bubbles and went on EZ, Best glass protector I have ever used so if you are buying the 7x, this is the one to buy!
[2 Pack]Huawei Honor 7X Screen Protector,Setber [Full Coverage][2.5D Arc Edges][9 Hardness][Anti-Scratch][Anti-fingerprint][HD Clear]Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Huawei Honor 7X -Blue

At this price point , My thoughts are with this grade of camera, battery life, edge to edge 18:9 screen ( makes phones with normal screens look ancient ) and the fact that it is reported the 7X will get the newest Android 8.0 Oreo, this phone is simply the phone to buy!
UPDATE: I have had this phone almost 1 year. I do love this phone. this is the only phone I have EVER used that has not locked up at least once on me! The operating system works PERFECT! The camera is much better than lots of more expensive phones. I own mega expensive pro cameras so I know! This phone camera may not be what is in a $1K phone but I would say almost! I like the camera, its looks fantastic.
Issues is using the phone in my home office. I have a new metal roof that blocks cell signal and I truly need Tmobil wifi calling. As I understand wifi calling is only on unlocked newer like 6+ iPhones or phones purchased from T-mobil so this phone can not do t-mobil wifi calling. I need this feature as I can't get good cell coverage at my home office. Tmobil has the digits app that somewhat helps but its a bummer I don't have wifi calling.
The lack of 5 ghz ( only 2.4 ghz ) makes for a slower wifi connection, not a deal breaker but on the new Honor phone its needs dual band wifi. needs to be USB c connector on the newer phone as well.
If you can live without wifi calling I still think this phone is the phone to buy! Almost a year and I still get 3+ days on a charge! Fantastic!"
B078NCL7GK,Chris C,4,"I ordered this phone direct from Huawei out of their Texas headquarters. Tried to order here @ Amazon but itâs been sold out. To be honest the phone feels like a real true premium build quality. The interface runs smooth and have no issues so far.

I bought my wife the Honor 6x for Christmas and was really surprised by the look and feel and itâs performance. So I waited for the Honor 7 to be released and so I got one. To be honest these are great quality phones. I use to be in a jump program with Tmobile where I traded in my device up 2 times a year, but I paid $150 a month for 2 phones lines and the ability to do this. Iâve had all the Samsung Notes, and one I phone 7 plus (I hated). So I know what a quality of phone experience is.

Since Tmobile made made itâs jump customers start paying $150-$250 down to upgrade I jumped ship and went to Metro PCS and bought my phones outright. I originally bought a Moto G5 Plus w/ Amazon bloatware which ran fine, and no issues. I wanted a premium feel phone. I believe I got that in this Honor 7x.

Donât worry about the Government and the public ridicule of Huawei. Theyâve been here for a long time in the US, also selling phones around the globe )3rd largest phone manufacture in the world). I phones and Galaxy phones are also built in China. As long as itâs a quality build I have no problem buying it. I rather pay $200 than $800-$1100. Iâm looking forward to next yearâs Honor 8x. Hopefully theyâll have 5ghz wifi in an update or in next years model."
B078NCL7GK,Gybbster,5,"I've had this phone for a week now and love it so far. The phone feels very solid and has a beautiful display. The fingerprint sensor on the back has worked flawlessly and it is so nice to be able to turn a phone on with just a finger touch on the back. It is blazing fast and has performed flawlessly. My son who purchased the Note 8 said he would have purchased this phone had it seen it before buying the Note. This is an exceptional phone for the money.

UPDATE: After using this phone for a couple of months I still feel this is by far the best phone for the price. I've noted that it periodically needs to be rebooted. I've also had some issues with the camera responding very slowly. I checked last night and I was low on storage which may have been causing the problem with the camera. I deleted some files and apps and I will see if that fixes the camera slowness. I put a simple Spigen case on the phone and have since dropped it twice. It has sustained no damage whatsoever. It easily has enough charge for the day. I use it with a Samsung watch and so it advises me that the Samsung app is consuming a lot of power, but I have never run out. I did notice some hesitation at times when using the browser or apps. After researching the issue I found that the phone only has one antennae for both wireless and bluetooth. I turn off bluetooth when I'm not using it and that alleviates the problem. One antennae is the price of a higher end phone at a low price. Everybody I have showed the phone to has been impressed with its solid feel and nice screen. I was disappointed to see a big box store drop the Huawei line. I believe it is under pressure from other phone makers that want to keep the price elevated. Again, if you want a really good phone at an affordable price - this is the phone for you."
B078NCL7GK,Sergio,1,"Unfortunately, i'm going to have to return this phone. I wanted to love it, everything about it seemed perfect. Large display, great battery, nearly vanilla android, dual camera, dual sim, speedy processor for the price. It seemed like a dream come true! Except, for one extremely important thing:

This phone does not have 5G Wifi. I will admit, i honestly did not even look at this spec when i was researching the phone, but it virtually cripples the phone. I live in an apartment building in downtown Austin, the phone is completely unusable when on Wifi. 2G Wifi works fine if there is not a lot of wifi signals around you, but in an urban setting with routers everywhere, it is so slow i can't even load google without waiting for a minute. Email doesn't work, pages don't load, app store is unusable....just forget about it. As soon as i turn Wifi off it springs to life, but unfortunately without the wifi i can't install updates, or install many apps, or do anything useful really without crippling my data plan.

Huawei, i wanted to be a believer and i really thought i had found a great phone, but i guess you get what you pay for.

Cheers."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Purchased this phone as a replacement for a One Plus Two phone that took an unfortunate water bath. I was looking for a phone that would do everything well for someone who does not game heavily on the phone and does not really require a high end chip set.

The build quality of the phone is excellent with a beautiful screen and well laid out buttons and fingerprint sensor. The phone looks like a $800 phone. The performance of the phone is fine with no issues after two weeks of use. There is no lag when switching screens and the camera works quickly producing very nice images.

Not sure I am in love with the 18:9 screen ratio. The screen seems slightly narrow for typing but it does help

The bottom line is that is this phone represents the best value in the smartphone market today and it rivals the performance of phones costing $400. You are certainly giving up performance and speed when comparing it to more expensive phones. You could buy 4 of these phones or 1 Apple or Samsung phone. And those phones are NOT four times better than this phone. The raw processing speed maybe that much better...but not the rest of the phone.

If your looking for a good smartphone that looks great....this is it. And your not going to be crushed if something happens to it."
B078NCL7GK,Dnmcdy,5,"Swapped nano SIM chip from my Windows phone and inserted a new MicroSD chip before turning on and it a booted up just fine. Going from tiles to icons required a little learning curve but that too went smoothly. Loaded Outlook containing all my Contacts and Calendars. Down loaded numerous Apps from Google Play. Downloaded Alexa App and serveral IOT Apps with no usage problems at all. I use both Google and Bing as well as the Edge browser and the One Drive cloud if desired. Finger print scanner is fast but a dual security of a Pin number can be used too. When turning on the phone you have a choice to finger print scanner or tap the screen and input a Pin number. All in all, this phone is a great value. It did come with a clear flexible case in addition."
B078NCL7GK,Joe Co,5,"My previous phone was a Moto X, and I literally despised everything about it, and started researching for the best phone under $250.
The honor 7 had the best specs and very favorable reviews. I've now had it for almost 3 months and I absolutely love everything about it. Fast and easy to use, and incredible battery life! I use it constantly, often browsing or playing a game while listening to audiobooks or music, and I have to remind myself to go ahead and charge it every few days, even though it rarely gets below 50%.
I've also dropped it dozens of times without any issue.
Calls are crystal clear. External speaker is great, I had actually bought an Anker Bluetooth speaker, but returned it, because (at least for audiobooks) I preferred the phone speaker.
Love the large screen too. Overall a great phone, and nothing comes close to it in terms of value for the money."
B078NCL7GK,J&M Chisum,5,"Husband, logged into wife's account. I purchased this unlocked Huawei last week to replaced my LG. I've had an iPhone and Samsung in the past and all smartphones have their up's & downs. This being my first Huawei I was a little skeptical however the reviews provided me some encouragement. I really like the design and although not as wide as my LG, it still fit in my leather phone case, which is a personal ""perk' for me.
Setup was a cinch. The device instructions are EASY to understand. It took a while since I had a ton of information to move over (12g) but when the process was all done, the two phones practically mirrored one another. All my contacts, photos, etc were there. Fast! Did I mention fast?! A big difference from my LG, which I have no complaints over other than when the memory capped, it was DONE.
The Huawei is the most programmable phone I've had. You can set your preference on just about anything. My one negative on this and it may be operator error, is I can't seem to figure out how to set an individual text-tone. Ringtones, yes, but texting.....?
The Huawei has an ""easy eye"" feature that blocks out the blue light for easy reading. Wonderful addition! So much so that my wife, having a history of Migraines, purchased her own Huawei and it's on the way. This feature and the matte screen protector, I purchased, reduces the glare considerably. Another added feature I like is the dual sim. With this option I will be able to purchase a prepaid SIM card for when we travel outside of the U.S. on our vacations. No more adding the international plan or buying a cheap burn-phone when I get off the plane. This phone has a dual camera function and, for me, it takes great pics. I'm not a photographer so as long as what I snap is clear, I'm good.
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Honor 7 to anyone."
B078NCL7GK,J. E. Rivera,5,"We had an Honor 5x we grew tired of. I still went for the 6x and that pleased me enough to have my wife get a 7x when the Moto G5 sucked software wise. Man I'm jealous. Nice screen quality, lag not noticed as per the wife. Screen size is what WE like, we are both around 6 feet tall and have zero problems with the 6"" screens though this is just under that. We'd actually like a bigger screen but can't be so picky at this beautiful price.

I have concerns that Huawei is not loved by our government but... that concern is pretty vague considering so much of our stuff is made in China anyway. And I can't afford to be buying a LG or Samsung and still love myself. I have a Samsung tablet so what am I saying... Hah!

Love it. If they added some more color variations such as silver or rose gold they might look even more pimp and sell out all day every day. Maybe."
B078NCL7GK,AsWangs,4,"I must say this is a excellent budget phone.
We picked 1 up from honor in Dec. Received Dec 20th.
I use a galaxy s7 wife uses the honor. But I used the honor 7x for a few days prior to giving it to her.

The battery lasted my normal all day use with plenty left over. Possibly 1.5 days. While I charge my galaxy s7 2-3x a day.

Only cons for me is no wireless charging.
And mine had a small scratch on the back when I received.

Cons for others
No usb c
No fast charging
No nfc

The performance of the phone is very good. The camera works great. I'm looking @ getting myself a honor 7x or better. Then giving the s7 to our 2.5yr old.

Also I rated 4 stars mainly due to the scratch.

Now need to find a good screen protector and case."
B078NCL7GK,Josh,5,Phone works great and a great phone for the price!
B078NCL7GK,JoBrew,4,Great little phone. Some flaws but still real nice.
B078NCL7GK,Jackson P.,4,Good for money
B078NCL7GK,gerald,4,i like this phone and recommend it.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"Either mine was defective or this has a 10 year old WiFi radio/receiver. I can't stream 480p or lower quality videos more than 10 feet from my router, more than 30 feet from my router websites take 1-2 minutes to load. I have devices hooked up all over my home that have no issues streaming video (Roku, game console, smart TV). I looked online for solutions thinking I have to be doing something wrong. Found a few (disable Bluetooth while streaming, software updates, etc.) but nothing made it better.

The display, which reviews indicated was a high point, is bad. Colors look washed out and muted. It has some sharpness to it, but the colors on my 3 year old Samsung J7 look much more vibrant. I tried messing around with all the display settings to no avail, simply can't make it look as good.

I give it an extra star because the design of the phone is sleek and the OS seemed snappy, but since it couldn't fulfill the basic promise of outperforming my outdated Samsung J7, it's hard to like much of anything."
B078NCL7GK,John_1,1,"Junk, Got the update to Oreo and after the update I have no screen notifications for calls, text messages and emails. Not even Honor's Support can't / won't figure out the fix. I opened a ticket with support and they keep giving me the run around..

Here is a copy of what i was told to do for the fix.

Frank C (Tue, 5/15/2018, 11:02:18 am)
We been having some issues with the recent updates but It's really helpful when people contact us as soon as you get any new update in order to let us know about any glitches/bugs the update might come with.
It might take up to a couple of days in order to get it.
Not all devices are updated at the same time since the updates are pushed in batches.
Just keep on checking the UPDATER option every week or so.
Try connecting it to different wifi networks.
And reboot it every 3-4 days.

This is just to get a fix..........

Update - 5-21-2018

After Oreo update..

Phone has been reset to factory defaults, Notifications have been changed again, changed sim, verified with provider no blocks on IMEI. Voice quality sounds like tin, Bluetooth drops even honor branded watches, Bluetooth wont stay connected to headphones. Charging extremely slow. Wifi slow and is hit or miss... Low light camera function leaves pictures dark and grainy. Zoom functionality for pictures are pretty bad. Touch screen only responds when it wants to.

Still no response from their support after opening ticket 6 days ago..

Update 5-24-2018

Honor support keeps contradicting their statements. our first chat he stated a few hours for a fix then in our second chat he stated 24 to 48 hours, finally they stated to check every week and reboot the phoneâ¦. So what am I supposed to do while I wait and wait for an update? I have a non-usable phone since I do not get alerts for texts, emails and phone calls coming in? Support stated the issue was resolved. Itâs not resolvedâ¦. What patch am I waiting for? I have other branded phones âLG, Samsung and a Google Pixelâ and when I contact support for an issue and they have to push out a patch for a fix itâs not done in batches as they state... it is usually within a day or less that I get a notification that a push is readyâ¦. So far this is the worst customer service Iâve gotten from a phone manufacturer. They told me to turn the phone in to their service dept, what will happen is I will get a refurbished phone back and then my current 1 year warranty goes to only 90 daysâ¦. That
is what has happened with the Honor 8 and the Honor 6x that I cannot use anymore due to their support center broke and refuse to fix the phones they broke..

Stay away from Honor or Hauwei products"
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"Love the phone, awesome seller"
B078NCL7GK,Miguel G. M.,5,Great cellphone.
B078NCL7GK,Randall Hodge,4,"After years of running mainstream phones (iphone, Samsung, HTC, LG), I believe I can say ""never again"". I've only been using the 7X for a couple of weeks, but it's my new favorite. Apparently I'm not alone because my phone was back-ordered for a week or two. So far, it's been worth the wait. The phone looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. I don't do a lot of gaming, but everything I've done has worked well.
If you are coming from a phone that uses a micro-SIM, you'll need to get a new SIM from your network vendor as this phone only takes a nano-Sim, but that was my only (brief) hangup.
UPDATE(3/18/18): I'm still a fan of the phone, but one characteristic that could be troublesome for some buyers is the WiFi performance. First, it only supports 2.4Ghz wifi. This shouldn't be too big a deal, by itself. Secondly, the WiFi antenna is shared with the Bluetooth radio. This causes a significant decrease in WiFi performance when using Bluetooth. For instance, in my house, with Bluetooth turned off, I get speeds in the 22-25Mbps range (download). If I turn on the Bluetooth and connect my headset, that will drop to around 15-18Mbps. If I start my podcast player, so I'm actually listening to content via Bluetooth, it drops further, to the 3-7Mbps range.
Since most of my content consumption is pre-downloaded content (podcasts, mostly), this doesn't affect me much, and I had not noticed until someone else with the phone (actually a nearly identical Mate SE) mentioned it, and I did my own testing.

UPDATE(6/21/18): Still using it, still like the daily experience fine. Since the last review, the software on phone has gotten two updates, one to a ""Project Treble"" based Android 8.1, and the second update just a periodic security/bugfix update. So, I can't say I'm disappointed by the software support. However, in the last couple of weeks, Huawei announced that they're no longer going to support opening the bootloader on these (or any of their other) phones, so I'm not quite as happy overall."
B078NCL7GK,BuzzFlipperFish,5,"Had to replace my Galaxy S6 and thought I would try a less expensive phone. The Honor 7X is a great phone. The screen is bright and clear and the phone is very responsive. It works fine with my Bluetooth devices and GPS with Waze responds just fine. I've had no problems or lag with any of my apps. It does not have NFC, so no Google Pay, but not a deal breaker for me. If I want great pictures I have a camera, but the camera on the phone takes good pictures and the quality is fine. I have had this phone since they were first released and it's a purchase I would gladly make again."
B078NCL7GK,Remy,1,"(READ UPDATES!)
First off, this is a fantastic budget phone. So good in fact that I will be writing this review as if the product is a flagship model, considering pros and cons in equal light.

PRO's
-Good resolution display (1080p)
-bright
-light, thin
-small bezels
-fingerprint sensor is lightning fast
-good camera
-easy to use UI
-comes with a decent case

CON's
-NEEDS MORE RAM! only has 3gb and it will slow down like crazy if you have more than a few windows open at one time (Huawai, if you read this review, this needs to by fixed like ASAP, at least offer a 4-8gb model, even if they are more pricey.)
-not the best viewing angles
-speaker isn't very good
-I have issues setting the wallpaper, every few days it resets the lockscreen for a few hours and then fixes itself (RESOLVED 8/16)
-can't get rid of google search bar on home screen (RESOLVED 8/16)

SO... SHOULD YOU BUY IT?
My answer would be that if you want to spend less that $300 on a phone then yes, buy it. It is a great phone even if it were priced much higher. In my eyes, it competes with the Iphone 6s (before they started slowing them down).

UPDATE 6/18: Noticing problems when using gps. Signal gets lost and has trouble reconnecting. Also the fingerprint sensor is having issues where it needs to be brushed off before it works. Sometimes even that fails. -1 star

UPDATE 8/19: GPS has completely stopped working at this point. -1 star

UPDATE 9/02: Fingerprint sensor works less that 50% of the time. Phone calls say ""Dialing"" for about 10-20 seconds before making a phone call. I really regret purchasing this phone, but at this point, it's too late. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE at this point."
B078NCL7GK,Darthdaddy,2,"Pros: it actually works. It has good battery life.

Cons: the fingerprint sensor isn't very good. It can only use 2GB of the 3GB ram. The touchscreen keyboard is sketchy, the swipe function is more miss than hit. The autocorrect is terrible. It drops wifi with no warning. The screen isn't optimised for apps, none work in full screen mode."
B078NCL7GK,Saracar185,1,"I rarely ever review, but I'm so disappointed with this phone. First off the FBI ,and CIA, have both issued warnings about using Huwaie phones. Secondly, this phone is so buggy!! I really wanted to like it , the display is great, the design is flawless, and camera is good when it works correctly. With all that said the problem lies within. The phone just doesn't work well at all. It's so slow while on the internet, it stalls out a lot, the charge is lackluster, taking pictures is a chore and can take up to 30 seconds to work correctly , and typing can drive a sane person into an asylum.I hope I purchased a defective phone, but given the warnings from the FBI I'm returning it , and never looking back."
B078NCL7GK,S Star,5,"This is a great phone especially for the price! I got this for my daughter to use on the Cricket network. Hooked it up with no issue. Great service and durable. but, the camera is hands down the best!!!! I now make her take all the pics anytime we go anywhere. I'm about to order this phone for myself I am so impressed!"
B078NCL7GK,LAL,5,"Great phone, had over a month and no probs, it's fast, never slowed down, handles anything I throw at it, call quality great, LTE and WiFi excellent, no probs. Display is ð, and the screen size is great, colours etc. Battery lasts two days with normal use and camera is great in daylight and good/ okish with night pics. The build is great, it's sleek and it don't look like no cheap handset. Lots of features and more than worth the price I paid. I bought the blue one and it looks ð. The loudspeaker is good, not the best tho, but with all other pros, it's a minor. I would recommend this Honor 7x to anyone."
B078NCL7GK,yoda,1,"my husband ordered these phones when we needed new ones, we thought it would be cheaper than going with Samsung. boy were we wrong! they worked amazingly well in the beginning, but after having them for about 3 months the GPS started to go haywire, and the reception was terrible. they also started dropping calls like crazy. so we had to order new phones about 6 months or so later because they deteriorated so fast."
B078NCL7GK,Brazensage,4,"I've had this phone for a few months. Ordered it off of the hihonor website because it was back-ordered here. Since my Nexus 5x had bootlooped I couldn't wait a week+ for it to get here. Here is my review:

Performance 7/10
------------------
Does 90% of what I need it to when I need it. I am by no means a power user, I have no social media apps on my phone and use it to mostly check the news, navigate, and make calls. Biggest gripes is the occasional hang up on apps, where it will not load data when I tell it to. For example, sometimes I'll click on a link and nothing will happen. It's not an app problem, but a problem with the phone. Phone gets really bogged down if you are trying to run multiple apps at once (ie phone navigation, listening to an audiobook over bluetooth, checking messages). As many others have mentioned the camera is VERY slow. I am not exaggerating when I say it takes 10-15 seconds for the app to fully fire up and allow you to take pictures. Don't expect to capture any kodak moments with this phone.

Interface/OS 8/10
------------
I didn't really like EMUI, so I downloaded the nova launcher. A lot more slick. After making that change early on, I'm still waiting on the EMUI 8 update which I have yet to get. However, I am not going to complain much for a phone that does what I need it to do.

Price 10/10
--------
Probably best bang for your buck even after the complaints to performance. Will make calls when I need to and call quality is good. That should be most of the reason you need this phone. Uses google maps just fine and I have few problems running any single app. Not having a USB-C doesn't bother me, as most of my other devices are still the old USB standard. It's nice to be able to travel and use one type of cord for my PS4 controller, phone, and tablet again. I've never been caught in a bind because my phone takes 2 hours to fully charge instead of one. . .

Final Thoughts: I am not feeding into the phone consumerism nonsense, where it is now the norm to spend $600-1000 on a phone every 2-3 years. I hope Huawei can stick to releasing quality phones for under $400 in the U.S. I plan on using them for as long as I can."
B078NCL7GK,Connor Barnes,1,"There is a known hardware problem on this phone where the GPS receiver doesn't work. It simply will not connect to any satellites. Huawei knows this as do I and many other owners. I've been trying to work with customer service for weeks to resolve and no dice. They won't replace it even though the phone is under warranty and is eligible (their words).

I do not recommend."
B078NCL7GK,veronica brown,5,"I absolutely love this phone! I was skeptical about buying it at first, because I have never ordered a phone online before. & I never thought I'd start by buying one off this app. but I am so glad I made this purchase. the camera's are good, the shipping starts fast & mine was delivered right on time. the battery life is AMAZING. I wake up at 7am every day, go to work for 8 hours & when I leave work my battery is only on 92% most days, sometimes it's higher! and then I don't have to charge it until I go to bed. I absolutely would recommend this phone to anyone! very good quality and great looking phone great for people on a budget or for people who just don't like paying $700+ for a good phone."
B078NCL7GK,Hersses,4,"I donât will be a put a large review this phone is good is fast but have 2 problems.
1 Bluetooth donât connect with my sonata 2017 automatically every time I going to my car I need set up connection manually is very annoying.
2 screen is very good but smug with nothing all time I need clean for keep sharp.
I work for celular store I have a bunch of smartphones like iPhone X xiaomi mi a1 pixel 2 and more . This phone is good I can use this for my daily driver but is the connection trough Bluetooth in the car is important for you look other phone. Just for be clear I bought the red edition from honor website I recommend buy th phone from amazon because the return process from honor USA is very slow. I am still waiting for the rma and label from more than 12 hours."
B078NCL7GK,Sameer Patel,5,"After two weeks of usage, i can say that dont go by the price tag. This phone can easily give competition to some flagship phones costing 4 or 5 times more. The phone looks premium and people often mistake it for galaxy phone. Battery easily goes for 2 days , camera is good and portrait mode also comes out good. Face Id works pretty well, and finger print is snappy. Love the way u can use the finger print to pull down notification bar or scroll through photos.
All in all, a great device for the price."
B078NCL7GK,nicola sambuco,5,"Coming from iphone 6, this phone is simply amazing. Everything works smoothly after 2 months, and with Android Oreo recently updated is even better. A phone with face id at this price and all the functionality at this range of price is incredible, considering that I also have a micro SD of 128gb. No need to spend 1000 dollars for a phone."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,Wouldn't recognize SIM Card. Sent it in for repair. 10 days later received the phone with a note. They refused to repair and honor the warranty because of the liquid damage. I have never dropped or put it in the water. Only took three pictures at a light raining day. All my friends' phone are fine at the same situation but mine.
B078NCL7GK,Danni,2,I was extremely disappointed as soon as I gave it to my daughter it fell and the screen cracked so bad I couldn't believe it. When I checked to see how much it cost to get fixed it was almost as much as the phone.
B078NCL7GK,Anjani,1,"I was unlucky with the phone, it died completely after 2 days of purchase, I got it on a Sunday, die on Tuesday, suddenly, it won't start, searching on the net found some other people with the same problem, some after a week some after a month. Returning it to Amazon for refund. I may have gotten a lemon, but I won't be buying another Honor again."
B078NCL7GK,Suf,3,"Before I bought this phone, I read about how terribly it lagged, how it takes forever to open an app and how incredibly frustrating it is when you are trying to do something. I went and bought it anyway, directly from the honor store. It worked well the first week, then I started noticing some lagging the second week. This is my third week of ownership and the negatives far outweighs any benefits this phone has."
B078NCL7GK,Glenn Cox,5,Damn near perfect $200 phone. I had a few glitches to work out but they were primarily a function of me ignoring the instructions. The camera is a little weak - but good enough for almost every use I have. An excellent $200 phone..Absolute best $200 phone I have ever seen or used.
B078NCL7GK,Kindle Customer123,4,"I bought this phone off eBay brand new for 254 because at the time the Honour store and Amazon were both out of stock of the phone. Everything works well except the Bluetooth, I had to download a third party app from the play store in order to connect to my Bluetooth speaker, it will not connect to any Bluetooth devices using the software it comes with and that really sucks. Also when you are paired the WiFi slows down significantly.

Also the phone unlocks with the fingerprint sensor but can't be locked with it."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,2,"This is a nicely designed device. The screen is large and colors pop, the body is all metal, and the fingerprint sensor and camera are great. Unfortunately, after about a month of use, I can't recommend this. I don't use my device for gaming, just videos, email and social media. It has slowed down so horribly in the short time I've had it. Snapchat and Facebook regularly crash. Having more than an app or two open brings the speed to a crawl. This is the second phone I've purchased from Huawei, the first being the 5X, and neither have had great, or even good, performance. I'd try out the Moto G5S or something comparable. Overall, not worth the buy. Don't be fooled by the low price tag and fancy body."
B078NCL7GK,Dash,2,"For the two months that i had this phone, it worked ok, until it was updated with BND-L24 8.0.0.330(C567) and all my apps stopped working over cellular network, they only worked on WiFi. I had to reset the phone to the previous operating system for my apps to work again. This is very poor update from Huawei."
B078NCL7GK,Myca,3,"I ordered this phone for my sister, and within the time I opened up the box and pulled it out the new film and everything, It had scratches on the phone. I didn't buy this refurbished, I bought it new, so for there to be deep scratches on the front of the screen and new in a box was unacceptable. I returned it, and I'm ordering it again, for the last time, if I have the same issues, I will not be buying this phone."
B078NCL7GK,Michael,5,"Great Phone sturdy and easy to use great features. camera and video quality are very good. features galore this phone does a lot. Great size screen clear display. Just cant under score the amount of features. Camera modes, low battery mode ,"
B078NCL7GK,jkp,1,"Purchased an Honor Phone, Back separated from the screen. Huawei said is was my fault and would not honor a warranty after 7 months of ownership. The electronics still worked fine. What a joke! The Phone separated and then just got worse and worse. What crap."
B078NCL7GK,Kindle Customer Bob Sheridan,5,"it's the best phone I have ever owned.Everything works well,fast and snappy ,excellent voice quality,duel rear cameras and the only Android phone I have ever had that I can get 2 days of battery life.What can I say,it's just a great phone and for under 200 bucks."
B078NCL7GK,andrea,3,"The battery is amazing! It lasts all day I do use YouTube a lot, maybe 5 hours throughout the day. The pictures are horribleðwhy can't I send multiple pictures at a time? The sound for me is so bad because it's too low I love hearing music on my phoneð. I did accidently dropped in my tub with water, it turned out fine ð® ð"
B078NCL7GK,Geoff Fix,1,"This phone simply died after 7 months. I sent it in for warranty service, and they told me it had ""liquid damage."" Apparently there is an indicator that shows red if exposed to ""liquid"". However, Huawei support told me that simple vapor, even high humidity, can cause it to turn red! They acknowledged that (1) the phone is billed as water resistant, and (2) only ""liquid"" voids the warranty... but in the next breath told me that water vapor is considered liquid. Hence they will not honor the warranty. AVOID HUAWEI!"
B078NCL7GK,Miream Adugna,5,"I love this phone! I never wrote any reviews previously on anything I bought. But this phone is too good to ignore. I have it for a few months now, and it works really good. It's a great phone for a great price. I fell in love with the camera, I just wish the 'honor 7x' didn't show up on every picture I took. It's also hard to get a clear picture while in movement. Other than that, it is a really nice phone to have. I would totally recommend it!"
B078NCL7GK,Gooch256,5,"Works great , no issues. I have the honor 6x from last year and bought the Honor 7 for my wife for Christmas this year. I bought it for $158 on Black Friday. you all keep on paying big buck for the IPhone's and Samsung's. I'll keep the $900 in my pocket. These are the best phones I researched for the price."
B078NCL7GK,Blayne,2,I'm annoyed by the simple fact that nowhere in the description did it say it required nano sim card and now I have to wait a week to potentially two weeks for the earliest one to come in that I could find. That and now I have to transfer everything from my old phone manually which is also annoying and hey how great is it to finally have a new phone that I can't use anytime soon because of poor marketing? I could have ordered the sim card along with everything else. I'll change the review if/when I get the nano sim card and it actually works.
B078NCL7GK,Sandy21,4,"Very good Phone for the price, no major issues.
gets a bit slow after some months, but can be ignored for the price.
Camera was very good. And No it doesn't take actual Portraits as iPhone."
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,1,It should be stated in the product summary that this phone is not compatible with Verizon LTE in the US. Verizon does not support this phone.
B078NCL7GK,Carlos,2,"I had the phone for 3 weeks and I returned it. The design and the camera are good, the best is the battery but the phone crashes a lot if you use Bluetooth or the camera and it freezes with Spotify or games. I wouldn't recommend it."
B078NCL7GK,Steven Munsta,5,"This is an amazing phone, I had it for a week and accidentally dropped it down a 100 foot waterfall. I went to retrieve it and the phone still worked!! I was surprised because of the water and massive cracked screen, I'm still able to make phone calls and the audio still works!

I don't know how the warranty works but if I had the money Id buy it again! <3"
B078NCL7GK,Mike C.,4,"This phone is very nice looking and has a good camera, but the software is the low mark for me. Mine gets sluggish and does not perform as well as my other Moto G5 plus. Battery life is really good. I am waiting for when there Android 8.0 comes out for it, I was real disappointed it was running 7.0 not even 7.1.1 which gave it more features. Finger print reader works great and is in a good spot for me on the back, the Moto has it on the front. For $200.00 I don't think you can go wrong. P.S. If you have 5gz wifi it will not connect only 2.4gz.
Update:
Phone was very unresponsive, however I unchecked close power consuming apps and it is now working fine."
B078NCL7GK,Elianna,5,"Let me make something clear... This is ONLY compatible with a NANO sim card. So for all you out there with the typical micro or mini...your going to have to get it cut. I scoured through the reviews and QA's to make sure it was compatible with T-Mobile, and it is! BUT your gonna have to most likely cut the sim card. Good news is in my area Best Buy does it for free, it only took 2 minutes. But I love this phone!"
B078NCL7GK,RGray,5,"I have had many Samsung phones S7, Note 3, etc. this by far stomps the competition."
B078NCL7GK,T. Lemelin,1,"Update/Edit: After the number of issues I've had with this phone I decided to do even more research on it, including checking benchmark scores. I wish I had done that first! This phone scores abysmally! Yes, it's a $200 phone and should not perform as well as a $500 phone... but keep in mind that you're taking a HUGE performance hit. (About 1/3 to 1/5 as fast as phones in the 400-500 dollar range.) If you have all the time in the world and don't care about performance of your phone or how long it takes to open apps, particularly the camera, then go ahead and waste your money on this.

Though, I will admit that this phone does have two pros. First, the screen is quite nice. The color reproduction is good, the brightness is reasonable (I can see it outside in all but the brightest conditions), and the resolution is quite pretty. Second (and lastly), It puts up with abuse. I have dented the back of the phone, through the case I have on it, and it still functions as good as ever (which is to say, sadly, still awful), and the screen is still intact. Which is unfortunate because I've been hoping to break it so I have an excuse to buy a new phone. Oh well. I went ahead and bought a Mi MIX 2s anyhow.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First off, I bought this off of hihonor.com - the manufacturer's website for their phones - because the phone was back ordered on Amazon for like a month.

Having said that... this phone is simply no good.

I wouldn't say I had high expectations for the phone necessarily (it's $200 after all), but I definitely didn't expect my streaming app to constantly stop or hiccup, whether on WiFi or 4G. I also didn't expect to have to wait 30 seconds or more for the camera to be ready to use, nor did I expect it to be inoperable once it was on the screen (pressing the shutter doesn't always work... sometimes it takes a LONG time to respond, sometimes it doesn't respond). Then when it does finally work the quality of pictures is subpar. Sorry, let me correct that, in full blazing daylight the pictures look great. Good color and great detail. I can see the individual strands of fur on my dogs. However, if there's a single cloud in the sky the pictures are awful. Heaven forbid you try to take night or indoor shots.

Another big issue is that the alarm app. doesn't work. I have no idea why... it just doesn't. I had to download a third party alarm app. to even use the alarm on the phone. I tested this multiple times and multiple ways (alarm vs. timer, overnight vs. a few minutes, etc.) and the alarm only sounds if, and only if, you manually turn the screen on while it should be going off. So, in other words, if you don't manually turn the screen on at 6AM when the alarm goes off, you'll never know it's going off. Yup! Fun stuff.

Want to turn down your phone? TOO BAD! This only lets you turn down the call volume a little bit. The lowest volume is still eardrum blastingly loud. I'm quite certain the 30 minute call I just had damaged my hearing. (Yes, this sounds like I'm being a bit dramatic but I assure you it's still very loud. And to top that off my supervisor speaks loudly, which is why I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME... but alas, the brilliant minds at Huawei apparently know what's better for my ears than me.)

Sadly I threw away the box just a couple of days ago, so now I can no longer send it back. So, basically, I'm out $200 unless I can sell it and recoup some of my losses.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. Seriously. Cough up a little bit more and get a better phone. This is a shame because the V10 looks like it might be a solid phone, but due to the issues with this I simply won't ever buy it."
B078NCL7GK,S. Koprowski,3,"if you plan on using Android Auto with this phone don't bother with it. Phone is great otherwise and very fast and smooth with Android Oreo. However there are known issues with Huawei phones and Android Auto. The Huawei dialer does not work correctly with Android Auto- when someone calls no screen comes up you and you can't connect or disconnect a call. This has been a known issue and Google or Huawei is refusing to fix it. Only way to correct it is to side load some hacked google dialer apk to the X7. This is just unacceptable. The other issue is that Google Play music has no sound at all in Android Auto. This is also an issue with Huawei/Honor phones in general. All other music apps like Amazon Prime music and Spotify work fine, it's just Google Play music. The fix for that is to install a third party equalizer app and have it running when Android Auto starts. I travel a lot and both of these issues are big IMHO and the phone is not worth the effort to get AA to work. It seems both Google and Huawei have no concerns to get this fixed. There are facebook pages and twitter accounts dedicated to this issue- just do a Google search."
B078NCL7GK,Doug T,5,"I've been using this phone for a month and it's fantastic. Large, bright screen, fast-charging battery that holds a charge for 3 days with normal use (I don't typically game or stream movies), fast, and great looking. There's a good reason that Huawei just surpassed Apple as the 2nd largest manufacturer of smart phones in the world. Their phones are top notch."
B078NCL7GK,AddictedToPrime!,5,Watch the youtube reviews. It is a great phone for the money. I switched from an iPhone 7 and haven't looked back. I love it.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078NCL7GK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_14
B078NCL7GK,Alan,5,Amazon's customer service is great. The phone is better than I expected. I am satisfied
B078NCL7GK,TheDaruma,2,"Short and sweet: looks and feels great, unlocks quickly.

But this phone can hardly handle a few low-intensity apps running in the background. The navigation buttons feel unresponsive and often don't listen to your input.

The camera takes a good few seconds to actually open up, and I'd you're stuck in the wrong orientation, flipping it around from selfie to front facing will take yet another few seconds. By that point, the opportunity is lost or your friends are fed up with you and your phone.

Flipping between apps by double tapping the square is always a clunky, rugged transition, with animations skipping several frames. Switching between keyboard languages is also clunky and slow-to-load.

Coming from an iPhone digital keyboard, the auto complete is a huge step back. Misspelling a word, having it auto complete to a correctly spelled word, but it's not quite the word you're looking for, so you backspace to tweak it a bit, only to have the word revert to the original misspelled word, is way more frustrating than I thought it could ever be.

These all seem like minor annoyances. They are. But when they're all working in unison it makes for a very frustrating experience."
B078NCL7GK,Pat,5,I absolutely LOVE this phone. Updated to Android 8 (Oreo) within two weeks of getting it.
B078NCL7GK,James Miller,5,"Had this phone for over a month now. It is fast, responsive and had everything I needed in a phone at the moment. For the price, it is hard to beat. I don't game and make few demands of my phone but it is perfect for me."
B078NCL7GK,RÃ¸jure F,5,It's fast it looks great and very affordable my only complaint is the launcher and the lack of rounded corners but you can easily change that with the Nova Launcher app and the rounded screen Corners Pro app but overall 10 out of 10 would buy from xiaomi again :)
B078NCL7GK,Keaton,5,"The audio jack is a lot bigger than most phones, so I had to order a new pair of ear buds. Other than that I've had no problems it's a good cheap phone. It runs every game I play very well. Couldn't have asker for a better phone."
B078NCL7GK,boomba,5,As expected geat phone for the price
B078NCL7GK,izzy4145,5,Great phone...
B078NCL7GK,Ramiz,5,Spec as Mentioned.
B078NCL7GK,Ali,5,"It would take an hour to write how unbelievablely,ð¤¯ð¤¯mind blowing AMAZING this phone is!!! Best phone I've ever owned! And something new about it discovered every day!! And it's absolutely GORGEOUS!!"
B078NCL7GK,Jay,2,"The phone seemed okay when I bought it, as months passed by started showing it's true colors. It started slowing down, hanging etc. I have to give kudos to Amazon Customer Service for helping me with this purchase."
B078NCL7GK,Angel Loreto Martinez,1,The back camera seems not to function correctly. Foggy and blurred.
B078NCL7GK,Christophe R. Blot,2,"I got my and 4 of my boys on Huawei products ( two 7x and a 8) and all of them stopped functioning, including mine after the second month. screens stop functioning, unacceptable hard half minute stuttering, you name it. Not accceptable. find another product."
B078NCL7GK,Victor Abreu,5,Good.
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,"After a long time , i get a wonderful item from Amazon.com , Good to have these. i suggest these for who find a good one for reasonable rate."
B078NCL7GK,Paul,1,"Pros : beautiful screen
Cons : too slow:
* the camera takes forever to be ready, look dumb everytime I want to take a pic
* forget about using snapchat
* random freeze for all major applications : facebook, instagram, after 2 months now I'm used to put my phone with the screen on after clicking on an app and picking it up later like this I am not waiting for it to be ready
* I presume some China spyware is installed

Should cost 50$"
B078NCL7GK,randy,4,The phone is awesome for$200 and now since it has the 8.0 software update it's even better
B078NCL7GK,Priyadarshini Mohapatra,3,I checked with the Huawei support and they confirmed that this phone will never support Wifi 5 Ghz. It's a big limitation for this kind of latest phone.
B078NCL7GK,francesco di sarro,2,"I ordered this phone from the Honor website and I honestly loved the phone. It has a slim clean design, though a bit large. The camera was nice. I really appreciated the small things that was considered like a pedometer that I did not need to set up. They include the status of not only the phone battery but also the status of the bluetooth headphones battery. These are just two of the conveniences that I did not expect but appreciated. In the end, I had to return the phone because the apps continued to freeze up giving me a wait or quit app alert. This happened a lot when trying to use the camera. Then the EMUI would crash. To summarize, The Honor 7 was nice when it worked, but it would stop so regularly, that I could not sustain it. I reset the phone to factory settings but it still did not work. No updates seemed to help."
B078NCL7GK,RJ,5,very nice phone . working well
B078NCL7GK,C. Gradis,5,"I bought this for my wife, she loves it. She says it is much faster than her old Moto G4. I still have my Moto G4, I will be upgrading to this as soon as I can."
B078NCL7GK,Jeff H.,3,Ok if you don't need GPS. For some reason GPS worked the day I activated it then nothing. Wouldn't buy had I known
B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,5,With the latest Oreo update it becomes fast and responsive. Best phone at price.
B078NCL7GK,Steven,5,"Great the graphics are suitable for most games what people
Donât understand is that they are giving this product 1 star because they expect this device to run like a Samsung Galaxy S8 and unfortunately your going to have to cough up $700-$1000 for a top notch phone itâs just the way it is itâs like using a sedan to haul a boat itâs not going to be very efficient if you use this to play causal games like temple run 2 clash of clans and Snapchat Facebook Instagram Twitter this is the phone for you if
You expect some great quality cÃ¡mara and speakers your out of luck on this phone stop being cheap and go get yourself a galaxy S8 or a Google pixel also this is a great international phone itâs compatible all GSM carriers around the world and itâs Dual Sim so itâs a plus all this for just $200 (again if you want some top notch phone stop being a broke hoe and get a S8 or a Pixel)"
B078NCL7GK,M Nichols,5,"Excellent in all respects - battery life, camera, high tech, great value. I have to laugh at the Amazon trolls who put this amazing phone down!
Fake news.

I bought the red VD release after loving the Honor 8. Apple and Samsung, there's a new kid in town and he is good."
B078NCL7GK,D. Boss,5,"Incredible phone! This is coming from a diehard iphone user. It's very responsive, excellent reception comparing with others, and a great camera. When you consider the cost, this is absolutely a no brainer."
B078NCL7GK,Aarti Shivraj,1,"I received this phone 3 days ago and my god i felt cheated... The phone keeps freezing, overheats & Shutdown. I am very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews :( I just wish it was the phone i expect it to be according to the specs and review but guess what??? it isn't!!!!! I cant even use this phone to do anything because it runs very hot and constantly shuts down :("
B078NCL7GK,Pamela,5,Amazing phone smooth operating system and great camera why spend mode when you can get more for less
B078NCL7GK,eric,5,Yeetus

B078NCL7GK,Amazon Customer,4,My only complaint is how easily the screen scratches.
B078NCL7GK,AndrÃ©s Serrano,5,"Excellent product, it serves super well and they give you a cell phone case"
B078NCL7GK,jins t.,1,The touch screen was not working properly. Had returned the item.
B078NCL7GK,Triesha Stovall,4,Nice!
B078NCL7GK,ShoppyG,2,"I liked this phone but ended up returning it. Too many cons I couldn't get past even though I loved how the phone looked.
- lagged/froze often. Esp when googling or using Facebook
- camera delay. I'd often miss shots bc the camera would not launch quickly enough
- text/ mms issue. The msgs would not download automatically for some reason I cannot figure out.
Returned it and got a G5 plus which is corny but reliable."
B078NCL7GK,Luis,3,"First of all I bought this phone back in December directly from Honor's website.
Pros: Large fairly beautiful screen, very fast fingerprint sensor and a decent camera. Good build quality body.
Cons: The screen material feels like plastic not glass. The worst part of the phone is the EMUI skin they put over Android 7.1.1 is very laggy. I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting."
B078NCL7GK,Smik,2,"on 2nd day we got the dreaded Headphone jack bug. Phone thinks there is a headset connected. they skimped out on quality around the headset area and it's causing massive probs all around. Its with the connections inside the phone, reset wont fix."
B078NCL7GK,Arthur Posner,5,With the Oreo update this phone is great..As good as phones 2-3 times its price....
B078NCL7GK,Luis Ramirez Castro,1,"This phone indeed looks like a nice option! But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job.
I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again).

All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine?

My advice: look into another option and save your time and money."
B078NCL7GK,Greg F.,1,"all of my apps freeze. email, camera, photos, DJI go, work app, blue iris, whatever i throw at it. i upgraded from a $40 POS motorola phone and this 7X POS makes the cheap unlocked prepaid look awesome. a reboot clears it temporarily. i optimized it with some easy steps and still no go. i had this phone for less than 2 weeks, purchased directly from hujway store and it looks every day it looks more like its a waste of money. OS and all apps are up-to-date. next stop is a dumpster. spend your money elsewhere."
B078NCL7GK,Jake,1,"I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week.
I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it.
Hereâs how it went.

The pros of the phone
1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing.
2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesnât support android pay...how?
3. This is a half and half.
The cameras are nice but itâs kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone seâs 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take.

Annnnd thatâs it for pros lol

Cons:

1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you canât access it from the lock screen. Youâll always miss the shot.
2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast itâll be dead before the day is over and thatâs only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls.
3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks.
Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast.
4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications.
This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call.
No matter what you do it never shows anything in the lock screen.
You have to constantly check every single one of your apps to see if you have a new message. Example: Snapchat there is no notification and no badge app icon. You have to check the app frequently to see if you got one.
The vibrations motor, when it does go off, is the lightest feather-like vibration ever. Youâll never feel it.
So if you want everyone to hate you because you never reply...this phone is a good option.
5. Processor: the processor is really underpowered for what they are trying to make this phone do. Maybe this is what is causing all the other problems like short battery life (proccecor being overworked by its normal use).
From day one I had this phone freeze up at least twice a day. Itâs very slow trying to run or send anything.
6. Speakers: the single down firing speaker is awful. The volume is very quiet for what you would expect from a phone this size. There is absolutely no bass and from an equalizer standpoint the sound it flat.
7. Micro USB port: seriously?
Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%).
Also, it doesnât support fast charging.
8. Honor? Okay this phone and itâs software is basically an iPhone 7 ripoff. Literally everything. Even the settings menu is made to look identical. To think they named this phone âhonorâ with the absolute lack of it.
9. Hacking.
Very angry about this and it was the point in which I sent it back immediately.
When you take a photo it provides a location of where itâs taken.
Well when I started taking photos. Every once in awhile my phone would show that my photo was taken in China. China? I was in the U.S. not China.
So my photos are being sent to China and thatâs the last of that phone.
Iâll upload the screenshot of the proof of this."
B078NCL7GK,Cameron A.,2,"For $200 my expectations shouldnât be high at all but this is just awful.

1) micro usb usb pathetic. Itâs 2018
2) great size screen and aspect ratio but not responsive
3) the UI looks like an iPhone. This makes the UI look super cheap.
4) camera is decent but itâs no where near other budget devices like Motorola
5) it has 4GB of RAM but runs like it has 2. Super glitchy.

Donât waste your money. Spend the extra couple bucks and either a moto G5 plus, essential phone or one plus 5T"
B078NCL7GK,ShoppyG,2,"I liked this phone but ended up returning it. Too many cons I couldn't get past even though I loved how the phone looked.
- lagged/froze often. Esp when googling or using Facebook
- camera delay. I'd often miss shots bc the camera would not launch quickly enough
- text/ mms issue. The msgs would not download automatically for some reason I cannot figure out.
Returned it and got a G5 plus which is corny but reliable."
B078NCL7GK,Luis,3,"First of all I bought this phone back in December directly from Honor's website.
Pros: Large fairly beautiful screen, very fast fingerprint sensor and a decent camera. Good build quality body.
Cons: The screen material feels like plastic not glass. The worst part of the phone is the EMUI skin they put over Android 7.1.1 is very laggy. I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting."
B078NCL7GK,Smik,2,"on 2nd day we got the dreaded Headphone jack bug. Phone thinks there is a headset connected. they skimped out on quality around the headset area and it's causing massive probs all around. Its with the connections inside the phone, reset wont fix."
B078NCL7GK,Arthur Posner,5,With the Oreo update this phone is great..As good as phones 2-3 times its price....
B078NCL7GK,Luis Ramirez Castro,1,"This phone indeed looks like a nice option! But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job.
I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again).

All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine?

My advice: look into another option and save your time and money."
B078NCL7GK,Greg F.,1,"all of my apps freeze. email, camera, photos, DJI go, work app, blue iris, whatever i throw at it. i upgraded from a $40 POS motorola phone and this 7X POS makes the cheap unlocked prepaid look awesome. a reboot clears it temporarily. i optimized it with some easy steps and still no go. i had this phone for less than 2 weeks, purchased directly from hujway store and it looks every day it looks more like its a waste of money. OS and all apps are up-to-date. next stop is a dumpster. spend your money elsewhere."
B078NCL7GK,Jake,1,"I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week.
I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it.
Hereâs how it went.

The pros of the phone
1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing.
2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesnât support android pay...how?
3. This is a half and half.
The cameras are nice but itâs kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone seâs 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take.

Annnnd thatâs it for pros lol

Cons:

1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you canât access it from the lock screen. Youâll always miss the shot.
2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast itâll be dead before the day is over and thatâs only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls.
3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks.
Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast.
4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications.
This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call.

Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%).
Also, it doesnât support fast charging.
8. Honor? Okay this phone and itâs software is basically an iPhone 7 ripoff. Literally everything. Even the settings menu is made to look identical. To think they named this phone âhonorâ with the absolute lack of it.
9. Hacking.
Very angry about this and it was the point in which I sent it back immediately.
When you take a photo it provides a location of where itâs taken.
Well when I started taking photos. Every once in awhile my phone would show that my photo was taken in China. China? I was in the U.S. not China.
So my photos are being sent to China and thatâs the last of that phone.
Iâll upload the screenshot of the proof of this."
B078NCL7GK,Cameron A.,2,"For $200 my expectations shouldnât be high at all but this is just awful.

1) micro usb usb pathetic. Itâs 2018
2) great size screen and aspect ratio but not responsive
3) the UI looks like an iPhone. This makes the UI look super cheap.
4) camera is decent but itâs no where near other budget devices like Motorola
5) it has 4GB of RAM but runs like it has 2. Super glitchy.

Donât waste your money. Spend the extra couple bucks and either a moto G5 plus, essential phone or one plus 5T"
B078NCL7GK,ShoppyG,2,"I liked this phone but ended up returning it. Too many cons I couldn't get past even though I loved how the phone looked.
- lagged/froze often. Esp when googling or using Facebook
- camera delay. I'd often miss shots bc the camera would not launch quickly enough
- text/ mms issue. The msgs would not download automatically for some reason I cannot figure out.
Returned it and got a G5 plus which is corny but reliable."
B078NCL7GK,Luis,3,"First of all I bought this phone back in December directly from Honor's website.
Pros: Large fairly beautiful screen, very fast fingerprint sensor and a decent camera. Good build quality body.
Cons: The screen material feels like plastic not glass. The worst part of the phone is the EMUI skin they put over Android 7.1.1 is very laggy. I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting."
B078NCL7GK,Smik,2,"on 2nd day we got the dreaded Headphone jack bug. Phone thinks there is a headset connected. they skimped out on quality around the headset area and it's causing massive probs all around. Its with the connections inside the phone, reset wont fix."
B078NCL7GK,Arthur Posner,5,With the Oreo update this phone is great..As good as phones 2-3 times its price....
B078NCL7GK,Luis Ramirez Castro,1,"This phone indeed looks like a nice option! But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job.
I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again).

All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine?

My advice: look into another option and save your time and money."
B078NCL7GK,Greg F.,1,"all of my apps freeze. email, camera, photos, DJI go, work app, blue iris, whatever i throw at it. i upgraded from a $40 POS motorola phone and this 7X POS makes the cheap unlocked prepaid look awesome. a reboot clears it temporarily. i optimized it with some easy steps and still no go. i had this phone for less than 2 weeks, purchased directly from hujway store and it looks every day it looks more like its a waste of money. OS and all apps are up-to-date. next stop is a dumpster. spend your money elsewhere."
B078NCL7GK,Jake,1,"I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week.
I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it.
Hereâs how it went.

The pros of the phone
1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing.
2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesnât support android pay...how?
3. This is a half and half.
The cameras are nice but itâs kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone seâs 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take.

Annnnd thatâs it for pros lol

Cons:

1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you canât access it from the lock screen. Youâll always miss the shot.
2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast itâll be dead before the day is over and thatâs only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls.
3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks.
Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast.
4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications.
This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call.
No matter what you do it never shows anything in the lock screen.
You have to constantly check every single one of your apps to see if you have a new message. Example: Snapchat there is no notification and no badge app icon. You have to check the app frequently to see if you got one.
The vibrations motor, when it does go off, is the lightest feather-like vibration ever. Youâll never feel it.
So if you want everyone to hate you because you never reply...this phone is a good option.
5. Processor: the processor is really underpowered for what they are trying to make this phone do. Maybe this is what is causing all the other problems like short battery life (proccecor being overworked by its normal use).
From day one I had this phone freeze up at least twice a day. Itâs very slow trying to run or send anything.
6. Speakers: the single down firing speaker is awful. The volume is very quiet for what you would expect from a phone this size. There is absolutely no bass and from an equalizer standpoint the sound it flat.
7. Micro USB port: seriously?
Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%).

B078NCL7GK,Cameron A.,2,"For $200 my expectations shouldnât be high at all but this is just awful.

1) micro usb usb pathetic. Itâs 2018
2) great size screen and aspect ratio but not responsive
3) the UI looks like an iPhone. This makes the UI look super cheap.
4) camera is decent but itâs no where near other budget devices like Motorola
5) it has 4GB of RAM but runs like it has 2. Super glitchy.

Donât waste your money. Spend the extra couple bucks and either a moto G5 plus, essential phone or one plus 5T"
B078NCL7GK,ShoppyG,2,"I liked this phone but ended up returning it. Too many cons I couldn't get past even though I loved how the phone looked.
- lagged/froze often. Esp when googling or using Facebook
- camera delay. I'd often miss shots bc the camera would not launch quickly enough
- text/ mms issue. The msgs would not download automatically for some reason I cannot figure out.
Returned it and got a G5 plus which is corny but reliable."
B078NCL7GK,Luis,3,"First of all I bought this phone back in December directly from Honor's website.
Pros: Large fairly beautiful screen, very fast fingerprint sensor and a decent camera. Good build quality body.
Cons: The screen material feels like plastic not glass. The worst part of the phone is the EMUI skin they put over Android 7.1.1 is very laggy. I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting."
B078NCL7GK,Smik,2,"on 2nd day we got the dreaded Headphone jack bug. Phone thinks there is a headset connected. they skimped out on quality around the headset area and it's causing massive probs all around. Its with the connections inside the phone, reset wont fix."
B078NCL7GK,Arthur Posner,5,With the Oreo update this phone is great..As good as phones 2-3 times its price....
B078NCL7GK,Luis Ramirez Castro,1,"This phone indeed looks like a nice option! But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job.
I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again).

All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine?

My advice: look into another option and save your time and money."
B078NCL7GK,Greg F.,1,"all of my apps freeze. email, camera, photos, DJI go, work app, blue iris, whatever i throw at it. i upgraded from a $40 POS motorola phone and this 7X POS makes the cheap unlocked prepaid look awesome. a reboot clears it temporarily. i optimized it with some easy steps and still no go. i had this phone for less than 2 weeks, purchased directly from hujway store and it looks every day it looks more like its a waste of money. OS and all apps are up-to-date. next stop is a dumpster. spend your money elsewhere."
B078NCL7GK,Jake,1,"I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week.
I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it.
Hereâs how it went.

The pros of the phone
1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing.
2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesnât support android pay...how?
3. This is a half and half.
The cameras are nice but itâs kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone seâs 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take.

Annnnd thatâs it for pros lol

Cons:

1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you canât access it from the lock screen. Youâll always miss the shot.
2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast itâll be dead before the day is over and thatâs only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls.
3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks.
Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast.
4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications.
This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call.
No matter what you do it never shows anything in the lock screen.
You have to constantly check every single one of your apps to see if you have a new message. Example: Snapchat there is no notification and no badge app icon. You have to check the app frequently to see if you got one.
The vibrations motor, when it does go off, is the lightest feather-like vibration ever. Youâll never feel it.
So if you want everyone to hate you because you never reply...this phone is a good option.
5. Processor: the processor is really underpowered for what they are trying to make this phone do. Maybe this is what is causing all the other problems like short battery life (proccecor being overworked by its normal use).
From day one I had this phone freeze up at least twice a day. Itâs very slow trying to run or send anything.
6. Speakers: the single down firing speaker is awful. The volume is very quiet for what you would expect from a phone this size. There is absolutely no bass and from an equalizer standpoint the sound it flat.
7. Micro USB port: seriously?
Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%).
Also, it doesnât support fast charging.
8. Honor? Okay this phone and itâs software is basically an iPhone 7 ripoff. Literally everything. Even the settings menu is made to look identical. To think they named this phone âhonorâ with the absolute lack of it.
9. Hacking.
Very angry about this and it was the point in which I sent it back immediately.
When you take a photo it provides a location of where itâs taken.
Well when I started taking photos. Every once in awhile my phone would show that my photo was taken in China. China? I was in the U.S. not China.
So my photos are being sent to China and thatâs the last of that phone.
Iâll upload the screenshot of the proof of this."

- text/ mms issue. The msgs would not download automatically for some reason I cannot figure out.
Returned it and got a G5 plus which is corny but reliable."
B078NCL7GK,Luis,3,"First of all I bought this phone back in December directly from Honor's website.
Pros: Large fairly beautiful screen, very fast fingerprint sensor and a decent camera. Good build quality body.
Cons: The screen material feels like plastic not glass. The worst part of the phone is the EMUI skin they put over Android 7.1.1 is very laggy. I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting."
B078NCL7GK,Smik,2,"on 2nd day we got the dreaded Headphone jack bug. Phone thinks there is a headset connected. they skimped out on quality around the headset area and it's causing massive probs all around. Its with the connections inside the phone, reset wont fix."
B078NCL7GK,Arthur Posner,5,With the Oreo update this phone is great..As good as phones 2-3 times its price....
B078NCL7GK,Luis Ramirez Castro,1,"This phone indeed looks like a nice option! But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job.
I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again).

All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine?

My advice: look into another option and save your time and money."

OS and all apps are up-to-date. next stop is a dumpster. spend your money elsewhere."
B078NCL7GK,Jake,1,"I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week.
I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it.
Hereâs how it went.

The pros of the phone
1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing.
2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesnât support android pay...how?
3. This is a half and half.
The cameras are nice but itâs kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone seâs 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take.

Annnnd thatâs it for pros lol

Cons:

1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you canât access it from the lock screen. Youâll always miss the shot.
2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast itâll be dead before the day is over and thatâs only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls.
3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks.
Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast.
4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications.
This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call.
No matter what you do it never shows anything in the lock screen.
You have to constantly check every single one of your apps to see if you have a new message. Example: Snapchat there is no notification and no badge app icon. You have to check the app frequently to see if you got one.
The vibrations motor, when it does go off, is the lightest feather-like vibration ever. Youâll never feel it.
So if you want everyone to hate you because you never reply...this phone is a good option.
5. Processor: the processor is really underpowered for what they are trying to make this phone do. Maybe this is what is causing all the other problems like short battery life (proccecor being overworked by its normal use).
From day one I had this phone freeze up at least twice a day. Itâs very slow trying to run or send anything.
6. Speakers: the single down firing speaker is awful. The volume is very quiet for what you would expect from a phone this size. There is absolutely no bass and from an equalizer standpoint the sound it flat.
7. Micro USB port: seriously?
Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%).
Also, it doesnât support fast charging.
8. Honor? Okay this phone and itâs software is basically an iPhone 7 ripoff. Literally everything. Even the settings menu is made to look identical. To think they named this phone âhonorâ with the absolute lack of it.
9. Hacking.
Very angry about this and it was the point in which I sent it back immediately.
When you take a photo it provides a location of where itâs taken.
Well when I started taking photos. Every once in awhile my phone would show that my photo was taken in China. China? I was in the U.S. not China.
So my photos are being sent to China and thatâs the last of that phone.
Iâll upload the screenshot of the proof of this."
B078NCL7GK,Cameron A.,2,"For $200 my expectations shouldnât be high at all but this is just awful.

1) micro usb usb pathetic. Itâs 2018

3) the UI looks like an iPhone. This makes the UI look super cheap.
4) camera is decent but itâs no where near other budget devices like Motorola
5) it has 4GB of RAM but runs like it has 2. Super glitchy.

Donât waste your money. Spend the extra couple bucks and either a moto G5 plus, essential phone or one plus 5T"

B0791VS3N9,ReViewster,5,"A quick bit of info. Between my wife and I we are currently using a Galaxy s8 and now this Huawei Mate se. We have been using the mate se for about 3 weeks now and feel confident in reviewing it.

For starters like a lot of Americans we were not familiar with the Huawei brand when we went to purchase a new phone to replace an older model phone. We spent the better part of three days comparing various phones from a variety of makers with the phones we knew best Samsung Galaxy series. After reading many reviews both on seller sites and in tech magazines we decided that for what they were selling for on amazon ($249.99) if the Huawei Mate se was as good as we were reading we couldn't go wrong

The phone we ordered was from a third party seller and they deserve some credit here after being quoted an arrival window of eight to ten days they got it to us in only four. So to bayshine store kudos to you on that one.

Just out the box the phone looked good reminiscent more of iPhones then Galaxies in my opinion,either way startup and set up were a breeze.

Now down to the brass tacks we have run several comparisons between this phone and our Samsung and honestly and I mean no disrespect to Samsung here this phone is almost on par with it. The few bells and whistles that this phone lacks are just that only bells and whistles. Just to point out some of our tests.
Browsing the internet

Playing games
Listening to music
Battery life
Watching videos
Camera Picture quality
Camera Video quality

Our results are surprising. In all of the categories except for camera picture/video quality the difference between them is almost moot the Samsung charges faster and has better low light picture and video capabilities.

The only complaints I have about the mate se is regarding such trivial things as downloading themes and backgrounds. Stuff of that nature. We found that we were unable to send gifs over mms when using the primary texting software and we had to get the messenger app from the app store. These are all small little nuisance issues and easy to adapt to especially considering the Huawei costs almost a third of what we paid for the s8 when we got it.

Now we don't feel confident to sit her and discuss the nuances of the specifications regarding this product but from a casual users perspective we could not be happier with Huawei's mate se phone. It is everything we need in a phone for an amazing price.

I would and do recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a great phone.

If you find this review helpful please let us know. If you have any questions we would be happy to answer."
B0791VS3N9,Daisy S,5,"Well, I am a very experienced Techie type and I was looking on Amazon for a 64 GB Internal storage with 256GB external SD Card Capabilities and close to 6 inch Android Unlocked Phone. Before I purchased this phone (in the Gold color), I read all the specs and made sure it would work with my AT&T LTE Data plan, Texting, Phone calls and also my home WiFi. And It works fine for my WiFi and Data needs.

*My goal in this review is to help you with your decision of whether or not to purchase this phone. Please note that this review reflects my personal opinions and experience with this phone.*

PROS:

1) 64GB of Internal Storage...however after the OS and Factory Apps, it had 51gb left. After I installed lots of personal Apps such as Word and Excel (free from Playstore) and several weather apps, Facebook, Twitter and Kindle, I have 46.84gb left. Plenty left if I want to install more apps or updates on apps.

2) 4G/LTE Data/Hot Spot Info. I have a ATT Data plan so I tested for 4G/LTE on an app and it verified that I have 4G/LTE. My LTE data is very fast and works perfectly when I out of a WI-FI area. The data hotspot worked great as I tested this on other devices.

3) Android OS---My phone arrived with Oreo 8.0 pre-installed. And it runs flawlessly!

4) WiFi and Bluetooth abilities: My WiFi Router is a ATT UVERSE 2Wire model (not a 5 Ghz). The WiFi connected immediately to this phone and it is a very fast WiFi, I tested the speed of the WiFi using an app WiFi Analyzer Pro, it tested at 72 mbps. So I am very pleased with this. Also, the WiFi is super strong and I receive 5 bars around my home and it keeps the strong connection even in my backyard.
* Bluetooth...So I setup a Bluetooth speaker and Bluetooth headset, both connected wonderfully to this phone.
I kept the Bluetooth speaker on and played music while WiFi was connected. Both did fine and my WiFi worked well and had a very strong signal.*
***If you later on buy a 5GHZ Router, make sure that is DUAL BAND and auto switchable to 2.4GHZ. Some of the higher end Routers have dual band/switchable 5GHZ/2.4GHZ. The newer, high end Routers auto switch ( make sure it is setup for this). This way it allow the 2.4GHZ Devices to connect to 2.4 GHZ band and the newer 5 GHZ devices can connect to the the 5 GHZ band. I have researched 5 GHZ/2.4 GHZ Routers thoroughly as I hope to purchase a new Dual band 2.4 GHZ/5 GHZ Router in a few months..this way, I can connect any device to the WIFI. However, right now my 2.4 GHZ AT&T Uverse Router is fast and my phone gets 4 bars of WIFI even in my large backyard, 2.4 GHZ band has a longer distance than the 5GHZ band. I prefer the 2.4 GHZ band over the 5 GHZ band because I need a longer distance because I am in a large house and need to connect to WIFI in any room I want to, even outside in my yard). And the 2.4 GHZ connects well with a great speed.

5) Display---The almost 6 inch (5.93 inch) display is very, very clear and colors vivid as it has 407 PPI sharpness, super sharp and the colors are vibrant! Reading on the Internet, Kindle book or PDF Book, the text is very crisp. The videos in YouTube are very clear as well.

6) Speed and Performance--I use Word, Excel, Facebook, Twitter, Internet, YouTube, Email, etc. I do not play games on this phone yet I found all videos run very well.
Performs well, no lagging and no freezing.

7) WiFi calling---Huawei does NOT have ACTUAL WIFI CALLING on this phone. I have a Google Hangouts account and Google assigned me a number. For me to call on WiFi, I use my GOOGLE VOICE PHONE NUMBER, which is different from my cellphone SIM CARD number. Note that I use Google Hangouts on my non cellular Tablet sometimes to make a ""WiFi"" phone call.

8) External Slot for SD Card---So I installed a SanDisk 128gb Micro SD card which was loaded with my music, pictures, home videos and files. I still have 75 gb left on my SD Card. According to Gsmarena, this device holds up to 256 GB Micro SD card.

9) Camera---I actually took some inside and outside pictures and saved them to my SD Card. The pictures (indoors and outdoors) are very clear, excellent for sending in email or even Facebook. My videos also came out well.

10) Battery life and Device Coolness---Battery life I find excellent and I am a heavy user of apps. I watch lots of YouTube videos, Facebook, listen to my music etc. My battery starts off at 100 percent, then after one hour of heavy use it shows close to 90 percent. So I am pleased.
***Device coolness/Battery coolness---The battery temp is usually at 77F to 86F, but after downloading say several books on my Kindle app, it will reach 95F, then go right back down to 86F. I use Battery Solo Widget free from the Playstore.

11) Printing documents on this phone. So I installed PrinterShare app from Playstore. Using the SHARE option in Word, Excel and many other apps, I print right from this phone as it prints on my HP Wireless printer. No need to get on my laptop to print!

12) Sound Clarity: I use 2 types of headsets, the wired type and the Bluetooth type. When I use a wired headset, it has good quality. And when I use my older Bluetooth headset it als o sounds great. Personally, I find the sound on this phone using a headset or Bluetooth speakers is excellent. And I listen to music, videos often with this phone. Also the phone call clarity is excellent as well, both on SPEAKERPHONE or using the phone by my ear.

13) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However it does have OTG (On the Go), which means with a USB/Micro adapter, you can insert a USB Flash drive, USB mouse, keyboard (one at a time). I use this to copy files from my Flash drive to my phone or vice versa).

Cons...Three cons:
1) USB Port is MICRO not a type C. However, I was happy because I have several MICRO chargers. No need to buy a new Type C one as my spare charger.
2) NO 5GHZ WiFi receiver. Since I have an older router without 5ghz, this is not a problem for me. *If you have a 5ghz router, you may want to consider another phone that has 5ghz capabilities.
3) NO NFC...This I was aware of and I do not use this feature anyway. If you need to use NFC, then this phone would NOT be the best choice for you.

Note that I am rating this 4.5 stars, rounded off to 5 stars because this phone has 64gb internal, huge screen with superb clarity and this a beautiful phone that is reasonably priced, yet looks expensive.

Would I buy this phone again? Yes, because of the very large screen, 64gb internal space and great price.
***Thank you for reading my review. I hope that it has helped you in your decision of whether or not to purchase this phone.***
Since I am a techie type, ask me questions if you like."
B0791VS3N9,Alex,4,"I've been using the Mate SE for the past few days and thought I'd leave a review to help others decide when considering this phone. I've been a Google Nexus (5, 5X, 6P) user for the past several years, so leaving Google devices was a leap of faith for me, but my 6P was experiencing the cold battery shutoff at 40+% issue so it was time to try something new.

I want to add a disclaimer that I am including the price point as a major part of my decision to give the phone 4 (really 4.5) stars. I mean, THIS PHONE IS $229!!!

A second disclaimer is that I am by no means a power user. My typical uses for my phone are texting, web browsing, watching youtube videos, navigation, some social media, and taking photos. I do not game on my phones, so my review is not evaluating gaming performance.

The Pros:
-Smooth operation. For my everyday use, the speed of opening apps and switching between apps is great and I have no major complaints. There are occasional times when scrolling isn't quite as smooth as on my 6P or my girlfriends S8+, but this is also being nit picky. Again, 95% of the time its great.
-Great screen. The screen is big, the bezels are small, the picture is clear and sharp and the colors are accurate to my eyes. The auto brightness feature also works quickly and seems to adjust to a comfortable level based on the surrounding lighting.
-Premium feel. I've been using the phone without a case since I got it and I like how the aluminum body feels in my hand, although it is a little slippery. The buttons feel nice and solid
-Fast fingerprint scanner. The finger print scanner is at least as fast as the 6P if not faster, and is quite accurate. I've only had it miss my finger print a handful of times and it was likely my fault for bad placement
-Slim design. Because of the small bezels and the thinness of the phone, the mate SE is easier to carry in my pocket than the 6P.
-Headphone jack! It has a damn headphone jack for those of us that haven't cut the cord on our headphones yet.
-Availability of themes. Having used stock android for the last few years, I didn't particularly like the stock EMUI theme that ships with the phone, but there are theme packs available for download on the play store that allow you to change the theme to pixel, oreo, etc.
-Battery performance. Again I'm not a power user, but I have been consistently making it through the day with 60% battery remaining when I plug my phone in before going to sleep.
-VALUE!!! During my research for a new phone, this phone offered the best features for the price. Hands down.
-Camera IN GOOD LIGHT. In daylight or bright light the camera is actually pretty good if you have a steady hand. The pro mode on the camera allows for pretty decent picture taking if you are willing to adjust some settings. I also like the bokeh/low aperature mode for taking macro shots. Its not as good as the pixel camera, s8/s9 or iphone but its pretty decent IN GOOD LIGHTING.

The Mehs:
-Bloatware. There isn't a ton of bloatware, but it is a bit annoying that you can't uninstall most of the apps that ship with the phone. I prefer to use the google apps, and I can't delete the stock email app, calendar app, etc. Not a huge deal, but meh.
-Nougat. the Mate SE ships with nougat, although a google search will show that Huawei is beta testing Oreo for the 7X and an updated EMUI. Hopefully the stable version is released this spring or summer.
-Typing mistakes. I seem to make more mistakes typing on this phone than my 6P for some reason. Perhaps it is the screen protector I have on it which isn't the best. just something to note, not a huge deal.

The Bads:
-Camera in low light. I'm just going to be honest here, the camera is terrible in low light compared to my 6P. Google is king of image processing and the Mate SE is no where close to any google device in low light camera performance. Keep in mind though, that this phone is also 1/3rd the price of the Pixel 2 and almost a 1/4 the price of the Pixel 2 XL, so a worse camera in some situations is expected at this price point.

Overall, if you are in the market for a new phone, and don't want to spend close to $1000 for a new flagship, the Mate SE is definitely a phone to consider if you don't mind the poor low light camera performance. Everything else with the phone feels on par with other big name phones, for a fraction of the price!"
B0791VS3N9,Ed Z. Jr,5,"Nothing even close to the overall quality, performance and features at this price point that I have found. Many people have written extensively about the features and pros/cons, so I'll just summarize my review with ratings based on what I think is a value at this price, with 10 being best value around. I don't have an iPhone 8 or X or Google Pixel to compare it to, but I do have an iPhone 6. These are my ratings after about 1 month of steady use:

Display: 8 - Not as good as the retina display, some barely visible pixellation on text, but images look great. Viewing at angle reveals limitations. The large size and small bezel make up for it.
Sound: 8 - Good quality for music, headphone output is detailed and powerful. Just a hint of hissiness on calls. Speakers are just OK.
Speed: 10 - The only thing that slows it down is resource intensive video games. Opening apps, running tasks are all lightning fast.
Build Quality: 10 - At least from the outside. Looks and feels very solid and well made. Buttons are responsive, connectors are solid.
Weight: 8 - It is a bit heavy for a phone of this size, but that seems to reflect the build quality rather than clunkiness.
Stability: 10 - No issues so far - I carry it around everywhere, no random sluggishness, no app freezes, etc. Boots up very fast.
Interface/GUI: 9 - The EMUI is good enough for what I need and I've arranged my apps for quick access.
Battery: 10 - This is where this phone really shines - I could probably go 3 days without charging under normal use, but I'm not a heavy user.
Bloat: 9 - There's not much extra stuff loaded and what is there can be turned off or ignored and doesn't seem to drain resources.
Fingerprint Sensor: 10 - If I could give this an 11 I would. I never thought a fingerprint sensor could add so much convenience but now I am spoiled. It makes the iPhone 6 sensor seem sluggish.
Camera: 9 - The resolution is very high, but the photos are just OK. Better than most phones at this price. Images tend to be somewhat grainy when zoomed. Seems that Huawei decided to go for max detail at the cost of a slight harshness to images. Camera is not very good in low light.
Memory/Storage: 10 - With 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, I've got plenty of room to load apps and handle the next version of Android OS.
WiFi/Bluetooth: 9 - WiFi seems fast enough and Bluetooth connected without issues to even my cheapest no-name devices, and remains stable.
Mobile Data and Phone: 9 - Get a solid 4-5 bars with T-Mobile in my area - at least as good as my iPhone, and remains stable. WiFi connection works well and is reliable. Maybe not the fasted around, but good enough.

Overall rating - 5 Stars
Summary: Best phone I have ever had at this price *by far*."
B0791VS3N9,ruel,5,"bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE. Huawei got me hooked with its EMUI 5.1 (based on Android 7.0) that is designed to kinda be reminiscent of the iPhone iOS, particularly when you turn off the app drawer, but still a powerful android. so switching to the new Huawei Mate SE was easy peasy. and having 4GB RAM and 64GB storage really helped a lot to make the phone much more comfortable to use without worrying about lack of memory or lack of space. oh, in comparison, looking at the Huawei Honor 7x here on amazon, but for a little bit more in price, the Huawei Mate SE is the definite better buy. both the Huawei Honor 7x and the Huawei Mate SE look the same but the major difference is the Huawei Mate SE is more powerful with the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. and the Huawei Mate SE is available in a GOLD version. my preferred phone gold color version. yea! definite no brainer. got the Huawei Mate SE.

myself originally coming from iPhone, my suggestion to others regarding apps to make the transition in finding very good equivalent apps to iPhone's iMessages, Find My iPhone, and Find My Friends, is to go to the Google Play Store to download WhatsApp, Find My Device (from google), and Family Locator GPS Tracker (from Life360). and if you are like me thinking the android app drawer is a bit bothersome, well, you can turn it off in the settings on this Huawei phone. hopefully this advice should get you started if you want to have a more iphone-like experience on a Huawei phone.

my journey is complete moving from iPhone to android where this Huawei Mate SE has become my primary phone. using this phone on AT&T and have 4G LTE. the Wi-Fi is only regular 2.5GHz wifi -- without the 5GHz wifi option (the Huawei Ascend XT2 has both 2.5GHz wifi and 5GHz wifi) but that's just fine if all your WiFi access is mostly to regular 2.5GHz wifi wherever you go and wherever you happen to be. personally still carry an iPhone as a backup phone in my go bag, but this Huawei Mate SE is my main phone now. went through other android phones, then recently got the aforementioned Huawei Ascend XT2, and now have this absolutely beautiful gorgeous Huawei Mate SE. physically very iphone-like and almost similar to the iPhone 7+ with the metal body plus with the dual camera on the back in the top corner like on the iPhone 8+ and then with the more modern 18:9 size front screen like on the iPhone X but without the iPhoneX ugly notch. also this Huawei Mate SE has a real must-have earphone jack. and this absolutely beautiful powerful phone performs smoothly with no lag. and Huawei seems to be hinting that Android 8 and most likely a newer EMUI are on the way for this and other Huawei phones for sometime during March 2018 or whenever. [edit: Honor 7x beta testing Android 8 and EMUI 8 began March 15. with maybe possible full release in April? (because news also reports Honor India says April for official release.) Huawei Mate SE should presumedly also get the android8 upgrade in the same timeframe sometime soonish whenever thereabouts is my guess....] so this phone will get even better with huawei support. yes, this Huawei Mate SE is very satisfactory. very happy with this phone.

PS: people have commented in other reviews that if you turn on bluetooth, then the Wi-Fi slows down. this has particularly been reported in amazon reviews for the Honor 7x, and at least one other person mentioned it in a review here for the Huawei Mate SE. so, did a speed test to see what happens with my Huawei Mate SE on my home wifi internet: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had 47Mbps wifi internet speed; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had 31Mbps wifi internet speed. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is reportedly owned by Netflix). okay this is with an ARRIS TG2472G cable modem with built-in WiFi that can handle both 2.5GHz and 5GHz, but only 2.5GHz is relevant for the Huawei Mate SE, where my home internet is on the Cox Internet Preferred 100 Plan, and so my plan's internet speed can be as high as 100Mbps on the 5GHz side but typically half that on the 2.5GHz side. of course, we are only concerned with the 2.5GHz wifi. turning on bluetooth and getting 30+ Mbps wifi internet speed doesn't matter in a noticeable way to me on my home internet plan. however, if your home internet is much slower like on a basic starter plan with a maximum speed of 10Mbps or less, then proportionally any decreased wifi speed with bluetooth turned on could possibly be noticeable to you. sorry, if you are a big bluetooth user. me not use an android gear watch or bluetooth earphones. if you really don't use bluetooth, then keep the BT off and this issue won't matter to you when you are on wifi. but if you are out away from home trying to use free wifi which can be congested or which may have throttled speeds already, then this BT issue could affect you -- and so maybe just use cellular data in that situation if you really need your BT. personally, this BT issue is not a deal killer for me. this is a great phone imho.

PSS: okay maybe the bluetooth-wifi issue is a load of hooey. tried testing wifi internet speed with the bluetooth turned on while on the Wi-Fi at my parents' home where they have a DLink 2.5GHz wifi router and where my folks are on the Cox basic starter internet plan that has an advertised max speed of 10Mbps: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had wifi internet speeds of 9.8Mbps and 11Mbps; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had wifi internet speeds of 8.4Mbps and 10Mbps. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is owned by Netflix). it's like no difference whether bluetooth is turn on or off as to the effect on wifi. but other real life factors could be involved -- that's for any picky bluetooth users to test, such as also using their particular bluetooth devices, because at this point, this so-called bluetooth-wifi issue is a non-issue for me. but my guess is if there is any effect, then it's a combination of your wifi router and/or your bluetooth device(s). (yeah, have previously seen differences in using a bluetooth speaker on my macbook versus on my iphone.) in other words, YMMV. bottomline as far as the Huawei Mate SE goes, get the phone, and if you are like me then you'll most likely love the phone.

Another PS: (03/29/2018) just got the latest android security patch dated March 1, 2018 for the android 7 on this Huawei Mate SE. this is update version B130. it's not android 8 yet. comments elsewhere over on the xda-developer forum indicate that testing for android 8 (and also presumedly emui 8) on Huawei Mate SE may occur after testing is finished for the Honor7x. my guess at this point is to expect beta testing in April(?) or May(?) with official final distribution sometime soonish afterwards?? just have to wait and see. okay yeah would love to right now have android 8 (with treble to allow for more timely updates?), but this Huawei Mate SE, with android 7.0 and EMUI 5.1, plus with the latest android security update, is a very good reasonably up-to-date secure phone. my bottomline recommendation still stands to say this Huawei Mate SE is definitely a great phone very much worth getting.

Yet Another PS (04/17/2018): GSMARENA indicates that Huawei Honor 7x to get EMUI 8, based on Android 8, to officially roll out with final release in May 2018. so maybe beta testing of Android 8 & EMUI 8 for Huawei Mate SE will occur sometime thereafter? could be looking at June/July for official final release on Huawei Mate SE is my current guess?? we'll see.... meanwhile, me currently still very happy with my Huawei Mate SE. oh, an app tip for those who use their Huawei Mate SE in the car: if you need a car app for playing your music and handling your calls & texts while driving, myself using the DRIVEMODE free app (found in the google play store). imho, it's better than Android Auto. can activate & turn off Drivemode from notifications, and overlay Drivemode on top of the music app, plus easy swipes & taps to control my tunes, and big buttons for answering calls & texts as well as voice control to answer calls and to read/answer texts. (oh, with the overlay, you may want to fully increase screen brightness & turn off the eye comfort.) drivemode works great with my whatsapp also. and particularly, the bigger controls (swipe or tap anywhere on the screen) makes it easy to manage my music tunes while driving, kinda sorta like on my old iphone, but different & better on my Huawei Mate SE which is usually docked on the dashboard of my car when me out driving. hope you all are enjoying your Huawei Mate SE (or soon will be if you are looking to get one).

Still Yet Another PS (05/09/2018): there are discussion messages over on XDA-Developers that indicate an Over-The-Air update to Android 8.0 is being pushed out in batches to Huawei Mate SE. the batches are apparently randomly sent out and so you may not get it right away. still hasn't shown up on mine yet. sounds like minor changes, but have to wait to see. good luck and enjoy your Huawei Mate SE.

PS Update (May 11, 2018): finally got the Android 8.0 & EMUI 8.0 update. see attached picture. if you have a Huawei Mate SE, you should also be getting this update. yes, this is the phone worth getting. Thanks, Huawei! ADDENDUM: after updating to Android 8.0 (EMUI 8.0), some apps like Swarm, Yelp, weather apps, etc may not show maps inside those apps and may instead state an error message stuck on saying: Google Play Services are updating. you have to clear the data for Google Play Services in the settings app. Settings > Google > Location > Google Play services > Storage > and then clear both Cache (Clear Cache) and Data (Manage Data > Clear All Data) -- and that should fix the maps inside apps."
B0791VS3N9,David,5,"I'm using this on AT&T in the USA, and it works great. It has possibly the best radio reception of any phone I've ever owned. I live in an area with spotty reception. With my old Samsung S4 and S5, it was about 50% odds whether the phone would ring, even if it was showing several bars. My next phone was a Moto X Pure, which would consistently ring as long as I was showing bars.

This Huawei does just as well as my Moto, maybe even a little better. So I'd say that it has a GREAT radio/antenna design.

This phone is awesome. It's blazing fast, has a great screen, great case, solid build quality. Huawei already has an Oreo update for this phone.

I was a little worried about whether I'd like the EMUI interface; I definitely prefer stock Android. And I was a little disappointed that they went with a non-stock dialer. I got so spoiled with the built-in spam alerts in the stock dialer. But aside from that, it's really not too bad. You can tell some stuff has been skinned, but it's not nearly as bloaty as I remember TouchWiz being on the Samsung.

Also most of the apps like facebook don't appear to be cooked into the ROM, because I was able to uninstall them (not just disable).

A few minor UX annoyances:
- They don't appear to have embraced the heads-up ring notification in their dialer...it's full screen even if the screen is on.
- They have an AWESOME built-in way to hide the control bar at the bottom, but no easy way to go full immersive and hide the status bar. (still halfway immersive is better than nothing)
- do not disturb - the status bar icon doesn't show any indication of *which* mode you're in (priority, alarm, total silence). Just shows the same crescent moon symbol for all. (The alarm icon will dim in total silence, if the alarm icon is visible...so that's what I use)
- 8.0 navigation dock - I get that the gestures are kinda cool, but this lost functionality from the 6.0 dock, which had a lock button. I wish they gave you the option to use the old style dock
- ""lock screen"" widget - works great if you use the stock home screen, but doesn't work if you replace the home screen (I like Nova better)

attaboys:
- this is the first phone that has showed my bluetooth headset battery level...that's awesome!
- came with a very nice TPU clear case...never seen that before!
- insanely good battery life...yesterday after 18 hours I was still at 70%

Warning: If you like root, I was a little surprised after I ordered this to see that Huawei was in the process of phasing out their bootloader unlock code service. I had checked this out when I was researching a few weeks back, but they just made this decision public on 25 May. What the heck! I was able to get my code, but website says in 60 days they will cease providing codes at all.

However even though I got my code, I actually haven't used it yet. I used to use root/xposed very heavily to tweak setup, but honestly with all they've done to allow for non-root tweaking in the last 3 versions of android, I've found there's really not much I actually need root for. I do miss my ad blocker a little bit, but it's a very minor thing, and I don't really have much ad-ware any more.

Also I discovered that you can do a lot of tweaking with SystemUI Tuner. (Huawei disabled the built-in android tuner, which you normally get to by long pressing the gear icon until it spins...but there are non-root apps that can provide very similar functionality. This is how I got full-immersive capability to hide the status bar)

All in all, definitely one of the best phones I've ever owned. And as for the CIA warnings...I don't know if the Chinese government is spying on my text messages...and I really don't care."
B0791VS3N9,James,5,"Okay first of all let me get this out of the way. Do not worry about the chinese government spying on you lol Huawei is there to make money by selling phones, period. If you ask me I believe Samsung and apple had something to do with that spying rumor because they want to keep the competition down in America and Chinese phones pose a threat. After all why buy a phone for 1000 dollars when you can get one almost just as good for less than 300. So with that being said, this phone is amazing. Super fast fingerprint scanner, camera quality is amazing, if you handed this phone to someone who didn't know huawei, they would think you paid three times the amount that you actually did. I asked Huawei about a update to Android 8.0 and they said it is confirmed and should be released in April or May at the latest. The software is well optimized and I can get about 6 hours of screen on time with casual use such as calling, texting, and social media. You can zoom in the screen on apps to take advantage of the 5.9 inch screen. The speakers are not the loudest but the quality is good and clear. The audio through the headphones is really good and it also has a mode to improve it even further giving it a bit more bass. The only downside to me is it isn't USB type c, but with how great this phone is all the pros definitely make up for it having micro USB. With phones like this, from Huawei and xaomi, the days of paying 600 to 1200 for a good for are over."
B0791VS3N9,The Maestro,5,"I've been on iPhone since before 3g. It's been my only smartphone OS I've ever known. With iPhone prices climbing every year I started to reevaluate my position. I saw Android users have so many phone options whereas my only options were, ""do I want a bigger screen?"" or ""do I want to buy an older phone?"" I did a lot of research and asked around and finally decided that I should switch.
The next part was the phone:
So many options. I was concerned that if I got a sub-standard phone, it would otherwise taint my evaluation of the Android OS. I was also concerned though that I would spend $600+ on a phone and I wouldn't windup liking Android. After more research I decided on this phone, the Huawei Mate SE (I still have to look at the phone for the spelling). My thoughts were that for this price point, I could evaluate the OS and if I didn't like it, I'm not out much after a phone resell and if I did like it, I'm not out much to buy a more mainstream Droid phone.
Thoughts on my purchase:
I love this phone. I am coming from an iPhone 6 and everything is phenomenally better. I'm sure I could have gotten a new iPhone __ and also had an improved experience but again, that costs a lot more $$ than I just spent here. I love the OS. There is a bit of a learning curve but after a couple of weeks, things make sense. The Android operating system offers so much more flexibility in it's settings and features. Things are in intuitive places so I am not digging through menu options to find things or having to use a search feature to find anything (coughcoughWindows10cough). I've have been keeping a Pros and Cons list and so far, most of my Cons are trivial things that even if I did use on iPhone, I don't mind them not being there for the sake of all the other Pros.
In Summary:
If you are not HEAVILY tied to all things Mac and are looking for a phone to test the waters of Android OS, this is your phone.
If you are tired of shelling out $500-800 for a phone that you feel the need to throw more money at for insurance/protection plans, this is your phone.
If you think that the ""notch"" in the front screen looks terrible and is a trend you hope fails, this is your phone.
If you want to buy a new phone that you don't have to finance like you're buying a car, this is definitely your phone."
B0791VS3N9,Y,5,"I recently came from the Samsung Galaxy S8, as my relative needed a phone, and I wanted to be free of my financing plan.

That being said, I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised. The Mate SE is a great phone. Here are a summary of points I liked about the phone:

Pros:
-Great Camera. Lots of options like AR mode, Pro Mode, Document Scanner, Food mode etc. High quality 18 MP dual lens system.
-EMUI is updated to Andriod 8.0 Oreo for a smooth running system with features like live screen recording, split screen, and more.
-Dual Sim unlocked, and SD card ready. SD card can be formatted or separate storage, which is nice.
-Performance with 4 GB of ram and 64 GB of storage is blazing fast, especially with the Kirin chipset.
-Screen resolution is nice, especially for the price, colors pop and are bright, but its not as extremely crisp as a Galaxy screen.
- Quick Charge enabled. Can charge 0 to 100 in around an hour and a half. Battery is also large and if used from 100% at 7 am can go up to 45% at 11:30 pm meaning more than enough for a day of use. (Medium use at half brightness).
- Comes with a case, always a perk. Case isn't top tier BUT its rigid enough for the job.
- Screen is bigger than my old Galaxy S8, relative's Iphone 8 plus and Iphone x. Full Screen mode works flawlessly and is better than flagship full screens.
- Speaker is loud and booming with no distortion at max volume.
- One handed mode comes in handy and makes usage easier.
- Fingerprint sensor is quick, easy, and conveniently placed, way better than the Galaxy S8!

Now on to the Cons:

- While the camera is amazing, low light selfies and pics will be a bit fluffy, although the flash can fix that.
- The phone uses micro USB, which is fine, its an advanced version of the port, but I would've liked to see USB type C.
- Screen resolution is high, but some apps looked better on the Galaxy S8. But for the price its not a deal breaker at all. Screen is more than enough.

All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this phone for anyone who wants a flagship experience for $249.99, and wants to be free of contracts and financing. Im extremely happy with this purchase and don't regret switching from the Galaxy S8."
B0791VS3N9,Samantha R.,5,"First impressions are really great. It's fast. Ample memory. Great battery. Nice camera. Got this phone for the kid, an upgrade from a much-beloved but no longer supported Amazon FirePhone (itself maligned for all the wrong reasons, a story for another day).

The camera has many features popular with the younger crowd (think: filters, background swap, beautify mode, AR ears etc). Android 7, while older, really doesn't bother me, since the latest security updates are available for this phone. We actually like the EMUI interface. May get another one for myself because it blows my older Note 4 out of the water.

If anything negative arises, I will update this review. For now... highly recommended.

PS Worried about spyware claims from US intelligence services and random senators? How interesting that most of these came about once Huawei surpassed Apple in terms of units sold worldwide. Politicized protectionist nonsense, if you ask me. I am really glad that Amazon didn't cave to the misinformation campaigns, unlike BestBuy, AT&T et al. I'm not buying another overpriced $900+ Apple/Sammy."
B0791VS3N9,Aaron Talley,5,"Don't even hesitate. This is a great phone for the price. I have several phones from xiaomi, samsung, motorola and apple. This is at the top of the list. I like it even better than my mi a1. Don't listen to all the foolishness."
B0791VS3N9,Tim,1,"2018-06-23 Update:
The phone was sent back to me unfixed. On the letter it says the phone has been rooted and VOIDED THE WARRANTY. The phone has never been rooted and now after only two months I have a piece of junk.

Original Post:
Had the phone only for about two months. It went into this error state and would not even allow factory reset. Contacted support and the only way to fix is to send it back to reflash the firmware. This is so much trouble and losing usage of phone for a period of time."
B0791VS3N9,roger medley,1,"Bluetooth hell. It's a battle to get it to pair with anything. I had to fight to get it to pair with my truck and it won't pair with my car factory stereo.
Crap for Pandora, Spotify and I heart radio. While app plays from song to song the phone acts like it resets after each song. Starts the next song 8-10 seconds into the music, basically you miss the beginning of each song.

There is a banner that appears across the top of the screen that tells you that an app is using power, no matter what power level the device has left. You are unable to remove it, it comes on all the time. You have to wait 10 seconds to use your phone app."
B0791VS3N9,Chris...,4,"Overall, it is a good phone,
The positives.
The phone is very responsive with no lag from touch to execution of command. The operations are smooth and the overall phone feels very solid. For the price, it is well worth it. There are a few bloatware apps that you cannot get rid of unless you root the phone, but they're easy to hide.

Negatives.
This phone does not play WMA files. I'm pretty frustrated about this because the Huawei website specifies WMA files are playable. However, I've uploaded several WMA files. When I check the file itself, it is on the phone, but when I go to play it through any player, the albums are empty. Moreover, the songs will not come up in song lists. Of course, when I load MP3s to the phone, it plays without a problem.

Other comments.
Note, this phone takes a Micro and a Nano SIM card. If you already have a MicroSD for extra memory, you need to get a nano SIM from your provider (or vice-versa). This isn't a negative, just an FYI.

EDIT: I am also concerned about the company's customer service as noted below by their response. They paid no attention to my complaint and instead, used this review as a way to piggyback more advertising."
B0791VS3N9,Keith,5,"I love this phone. Best ever. Long battery life, great camera, excellent screen resolution, and this phone is fast.
The Mate SE comes with Android 7. After I activated this phone, I was asked "" do I want to update the phone? "". I chose yes, it downloaded and installed the updates. After the update, it was now running Android 8.0. Wow! Nice surprise.
That's why I'm writing this review. While I was searching for the right phone, I was looking for a phone with Android 8. I settled for Android 7 anyway, considering that the Mate SE met or exceeded all of my other criteria.
I just wanted everybody to know, this is an Android 8 phone.
So, I say again, For the price, this Huawei Mate SE is The Best.
I highly recommend this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Joe,2,"First off I never use the camera, so whatever on the picture quality.

I'm returning this device. In addition to mine slowly degrading with less than a month of use, guys this really isn't a great value. There are other smartphones out there that have better hardware at the same price. I'm not a phone guy, I'm a PC builder/enthusiast, so my interest is strictly hardware. This led me to buying this phone, until I realized I should've paid a BIT more attention to a few things.

-the Kirin processor is proprietary, this is cool but I don't like their software. Is full of bloatware and leaves me with 2.5 gigs of available system memory. I'd love good old vanilla Android but
-cant unlock the bootloader. I knew that starting off but didn't think memory management would be this bad and
-ITS LPDDR3 MEMORY!!!! Other phones in this area have ddr4 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUAWEI. Ddr3 memory is half the performance of ddr4 and twice the power consumption. It's especially noticeable in day to day use, bad
-oreo 8.1 doesn't run as stable as nougat

My reason for return is battery issues, thats just a lemon. I'm not accusing Huawei of installing crap batteries, in that Dept they are reliable as hell, but I'm not replacing the phone with another Huawei/honor. Because I want this review to be respected as honest, I will not recommend nor reveal what company I've decided to buy from this time. Honestly, this is not worth 200 dollars, do 10 minutes of real research (read/specs and compare don't just f*** watch YouTube) and then pick what's right for you. I think being more informed and educated would allow you to see that this phone is probably not what you really wanted in a 250 dollar phone, and you can certainly do better"
B0791VS3N9,Aaron Recine,5,"I've had this phone since March, previously owning a Honor 6x. I am very happy with it.

My usage isn't super heavy. I use Instagram, Youtube, Gmail and Google Chrome the most and all these function flawlessly. I take a lot of video / pictures and the camera quality is great. Low light is garbage, but for my needs it does exactly what I need and the price was right

PROS:
The cost is crazy cheap for what you get
Very snappy and responsive, unlike my Honor 6x which slowed down rapidly after first owning it
Nice build. Got a Spigen black rubber case for it and it is the first phone with a case that doesn't feel bulky.
Fingerprint scanner is wicked quick and the placement is great.

CONS:
Low light performance sucks on the camera, BUT in general it takes great photos and has tons of settings you can access.
Some slight software... not bugs... but quirks, if that makes sense. IE: You can swipe from the left across the screen to access extra camera settings, but only when taking a portrait. Landscape you cannot access the settings (as far as I know). Other built in apps have similar oddities, but it really does not bother me.

Overall I highly recommend this phone. For the price I think most people will be pleasantly surprised at the quality they get when they first use this phone. 5 stars."
B0791VS3N9,Another Floyd,4,"I've been using this phone for 3 weeks, and am well pleased with it, especially as compared to my last phone, a Moto X Pure.

First, this one has a fingerprint reader, which is so fast and easy to use that I have finally elected to use a lock screen, whereas, in the past, I have been too lazy to want to deal with it.

Second, this phone has a much better battery than the Moto X had, even when that phone was new. The Moto battery became intolerable after 2 years; I hope to do better with this phone.

Third, this phone rarely gets very hot, whereas using the Moto was like having a heat pack strapped to my thigh.

On the downside, I cannot get Bluetooth on the Mate SE to connect with my 2015 Ford Transit, with the lower-level SYNC package. I am not certain this is the phone's fault, since the SYNC system has been sort of flaky. And, I am able to connect the Mate SE Bluetooth to my OBDII dongle. Fortunately the auto Bluetooth is not a deal-breaker for me, since I rarely used it, anyway.

Another deficit with the mate comes with the external speaker volume: it is only adequate if I'm in a small room with no background noise. The Moto X Pure had a great pair of external speakers.

The Mate's general image quality seems on par with the Moto, and the Mate has a lot more features that may be useful. The Wide Aperture mode is the one that gives artificial bokeh, and allows you to change where focus falls in a photo, even AFTER it's been shot. Test shots in this mode have been encouraging. The Pro Photo mode allows one to specify shutter speed and ISO, though the aperture is fixed at 2.2.

The Mate came with Android system 7, which I used for only a short time before allowing it to update to Android 8. Huawei's user interface is not pure Android, so some things do not appear in the menus that may be expected from reading about Android 8. For example, some of the new options for home screen settings do not seem to be available.

Coming from Android 6 I am not entirely pleased with this version of Android 8. It can be confusing to find settings that I want in the menu. The search function in the Settings menu is helpful, but some features just cannot be found with the terms I expect. I find the mobile data usage graph to be very much dumbed-down.

Some other reviewers have reported having problems with the phone's GPS. You must go into the Battery/Launch setting and make sure that each GPS app is set to allow running in the background. I'm no longer sure whether the default, per-app Auto setting, here, was the problem, or, if I had set some early restrictions myself. AND, the interface, here, can be pretty confusing as to what the default is, vs what you have set. But, it's all good, now.

I've also seen complaints about not being able to change the rather short screen dim and sleep time. Like me, people are going in right away and turning on the Battery power saving mode. But, in that mode, customizing the screen sleep time is unavailable. I finally abandoned use of that power saving mode. It doesn't help all that much. Really, the behind-the-scenes, full time battery savings over older versions of Android are commendable.

While I do not really consider myself a power user of smartphones, I did have to root my Moto X, in order to have unhindered use of hotspot tethering with my service provider. I did not want to go through rooting another phone, because it interferes so much with system update processes. Fortunately, the Mate does do hotspot tethering very well, for me. It did not appear to work at first, but one little change fixed it: I added "",dun"" (no quotes) to the APN Type of the Internet APN, under the Mobile Network settings."
B0791VS3N9,Vikram Balakrishnan,1,"My phone was working great for the most part since I purchased it in March-- no complaints. However, the most recent patch was forcibly loaded onto my phone(there was no confirmation it just restarted one day with the patch). That's fine except that now the phone dialer no longer works. After speaking with multiple representatives that made me reformat my phone time and time again, the solution is still not resolved.

There only solution is for me to mail in my phone and then wait 2-3 weeks for them to ""test it."" What am I supposed to do without a cell phone for 2-3 weeks? They offered no alternative, and I'm stuck lacking half the functionality of a phone(can't call anyone) and have a reformatted phone with no files or apps on it. Absolutely terrible!"
B0791VS3N9,Lisa,5,"I love this phone!! I swear, this is totally the best phone I've ever had!

I just bought this phone a few days ago to replace my Huawei Honor 5X. It arrived yesterday and I'm very pleased with it!

The speed is amazing and light-years faster than the older model (Honor 5X) and the fingerprint scanner is excellent. A quick touch to the back of the phone and it's immediately unlocked. I love that!

The camera works great and is very responsive. There is hardly any delay when taking pictures.

The Honor 5X I had before this one lasted a long time. I had it well over a year at least and I had dropped it numerous times on hard floors and concrete without it ever breaking the screen. I expect this one will be just as durable.

If you're looking for a phone with great features, durability, and a high quality feel, this is by far the the best phone for the price."
B0791VS3N9,oryoch,2,"=== UPDATING after 6 months of use, from 5 stars to 2 ===
So 6 months passed by, and I definitely regret this purchase.
The phone crashes applications abruptly, and frequently. Playing games for 1h will result with 1-2 crashes.
Additionally, it's useless for GPS tracking (e.g. Strava) since it crashes midway through the use.

If you avoid from using apps that will get messed up upon crash (online gaming, GPS tracking, GPS navigation etc) - this phone should get a 3-4 star rating due to the good value.

But for someone like me, it's not doing several of its core functions, and therefore is not recommended.
Would not buy again.
===
I have experience with both flagships (iPhone, Galaxy, Nexud) and ""VFM"" phones (OPO 3T, LG G4) - but I've got to admit that this phone managed to surprise me by surpassing my expectations, BY FAR!

For $229 I expected to get something that will be decent, this is a price of a cheap phone so I guessed that it'll show - but the reality is quite different. If you ignore the Huawei brand name and judge the device by its looks & performance, you'll be left with an easy buy for a $400-500 price tag.
So for $229 this is a definite no brainer, especially when purchasing directly from Amazon.

PROs:
+ S-C-R-E-E-N (+design) feels high end. They managed to squeeze 6"" into a 5.5"" frame by reducing the edges, the result is extremely good looking. This is by far the best selling point from a user perspective, and it makes most of its competitors look quite bad when comparing side-by-side.
+ Price + VFM: You're getting about x2-3 what you pay for, that's a crazy bargain.
+ Battery: 3340 mA/h is big enough for more than a day of use.
+ SPECs + Performance: 64GB of memory + expendable SD mem slot (or dual sim support), 4GB of RAM, no lag whatsoever (including gaming). I'm amazed of how much they managed to squeeze in for a ""budget"" phone
+ Day-light camera: way better than my previous OPO 3T (that cost double in time of purchase), dual lens with a stable performance. This is not flag-ship level but it's definitely not ""budget""-level either.
+ Finger-tip sensor is working flawlessly and very easy to use.

CONs:
- Speaker sounds cheap
- No USB Type-C, previous generation USB connectivity
- No quick-charging capabilities, I also think that it cannot be charged wirelessly (didn't check it though)
- Camera performance in the dark isn't too good
- Front-facing camera isn't too good
- Not the latest android, EMUI GUI isn't for the ""purists"" (but I must admit - it isn't bad at all neither!)

The unknowns:
? how will it perform over time, I'll update this review in a couple of months.

Bottom line:
I believe that the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot. I'd say that this is a nice bargain for $400, so for $229 - with respect - it crushes the competition. I payed for a cheap budget phone and received a great product that could dominate devices that cost x2 MSRP.

Big koodos to Huawei for this product, glad that Amazon is selling it (since I wouldn't have the guts to order it without their backup)."
B0791VS3N9,Cubed,1,"----------------------------------------------------UPDATE 08/28/2018------------------------------------------------------------------------
Going to 1 star. So I contacted Huawei support to find out why my the phone keeps closing apps automatically even the apps you tell it not to automatically optimize. It still closes those apps. This is the worst support call I've ever had. To cut a long story short, the support rep told me that all my apps not compatible with Huawei so I need to contact all the developers and ask them why their apps are not compatible with huawei and that's why they're closing. Are you kidding me?!!!!! ... Contact every single developer for every App on my phone. Even the Huawei Phone Manager App closes. My goodness they're stupid.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE.
------------------------------------------Original Review----------------------------------------------------------------
The phone is OK .. the response time when you click an app is really slow and noticeable. I guess that's what you get on a budget phone with a Kirin processor instead of a snapdragon.
----------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE July 2018---------------------------------------------------------
After using this for a few months, it's worse than I thought. A big negative for this phone is that it automatically closes apps even those that you don't want closed. If you have the banking app that notifies you about real time purchases when your card is used, forget it, will never work on this phone because it keeps killing the apps from running in the background. Even after setting the apps not to optimize, that feature is just there but doesn't do anything because Huawei disabled it. Very annoying. Also seeing that they've decided not to stop giving out the bootloader unlock code, this phone is more useless to me than a tree branch. This is my first and definitely my last Huawei phone."
B0791VS3N9,C,1,"Good phone, but GPS is garbage."
B0791VS3N9,Big Red,1,"Phone worked perfectly for a couple months. There was an emui update and now my texting is totally not working and the best fix I've been able to find is to do a full factory reset and I don't want to do that so I'm still looking for a solution. I love the phone otherwise and hope I can get this texting figured out.

Poi: the issue is that I can no longer receive MMS messages, neither picture not group and regular texts come delayed and in groups Tuesday put of order from how they were sent

Second update 11/23/2018 after three emui updates, the phone still does not pick up MMS messages and now it doesn't connect to Bluetooth anymore. Phone tried to be awesome but it's failed to deliver."
B0791VS3N9,Tsung,5,"Yes, there is something missing or not as good, but, for this price tag and what it offers, it is an excellent phone. Highly recommended. It has everything you really need.
No NFC (Near Field Communications): You cannot ""Google Pay"" wirelessly, period; No 5Ghz WiFi (You have to stay at crowded 2.4Ghz. It is fine. You really don't feel you miss anything); No replaceable battery; No wireless/fast charging; No water-proof; No high speed USB 3.0; No stereo speakers; No gyroscope (do you really need it?); No native WiFi Calling (if you are a T-Mobile customer, you can use ""T-Mobile DIGITS"" doing WiFi Calling); Camera is not as good at Low Light condition, and without Image Stabilizer (but it is not bad at all and the built-in Camera app has a lot functions.16+2M dual main at f2.2 and 8M front at f2.0); Use old micro-USB port without Type-C (which I like the ""old"" micro-USB that I can use all my chargers and power banks.); And, it has FM radio (yes, good) using 3.5 mm audio (I like the 3.5 mm) headset (not provided) as its antenna; Great 5.93 inch 18:9 display at 1080p x 2160p, 407 ppi (though it is not OLED, great display); Beautiful metal case with clear-color soft TPU protection case; 4GB RAM with 64GB storage (still not enough storage? you can insert in a micro-SD card up to 256GB); Dual-nano-SIM (2nd SIM only for 2G); Excellent finger print sensor with gesture controls; EMUI interface is actually pretty good. You can select between drawer or standard mode; not many ""other"" apps (if you don't use it, you can delete or disable it.)... and it is built by HUAWEI, a big brand in China and Europe."
B0791VS3N9,Yan Wang,1,"I bought a Huawei Mate SE cell phone from Amazon.com last May, unfortunately only a few months later it failed to work suddenly without any noticeable signs. We sent the cell phone to a cell phone repair shop for diagnosis and repair and were told that they could not repair it because the motherboard had problems so we had to contact the manufacturer. After contacting Huawei Technical Support USA, we sent the device to Huawei repair center. Surprisingly they sent it back to me and mentioned that my cell phone had water damage, and that I cannot get it repaired since water damage void warranty. In fact, this was false as the cell phone was absolutely not in contact with any water, how can it been damaged by water? Furthermore, Huaweiâs support team sent a falsified image of my phone with the incorrect IMEI number as proof of liquid damage which was not of my phone. I feel cheated by the company not just from its defective phone but also its deceptive support."
B0791VS3N9,macpers,3,"This is a beautiful phone that is reasonably priced. It is hard to find maybe because of the current tariff issues with China. I was very happy I found one but after receiving it it couldn't see all of my networks even standing right next to the routers. I called their support and they couldn't' offer any suggestions other than a factory reset which I did to no avail. It saw all my neighbors' networks. It saw various service providers. My other devices saw all the networks. I tried it in 2 locations 2 different service providers and different brands of routers.Their support wanted me to send it in for repairs. The phone was one day old. I returned it to Amazon and asked for a replacement. They were very good about it and when I got the 2nd one It had the exact same problem. I have 5 networks. It saw 2 out of 4 in one location and none in the other. It saw my neighbors some of whom had similar equipment, bandwidth and service providers. I reluctantly sent the 2nd one back as well."
B0791VS3N9,rqi522,4,"PRO:
Very fast, much faster than Moto G5, no problem to play games. My first phone with Kirin CPU, not sure it is the CPU or large RAM made this phone faster than Moto G5.
The fingerprint scan is accurate and fast.
The camera is good, both front and rear, a little overexposed some time.
Charging is fast, it takes about 90 minutes to get fully charged.
EMUI has a lot of features, very easy to access flashlight, calculator...
Install google launcher, ""Google now/feed"" works. (It does not work on Moto G5).
The price is great, for $229, cannot get any phone better than this.

CONS:
WIFI is only 2.4GHz, it will be a trouble with a lot of neighbors.
MicroUSB 2.0 but not Type-C? Huawei had too many spare parts?
Many pre-installed apps? I'm assuming Huawei get paid to install those apps."
B0791VS3N9,Raven,4,"I wish I had heard of this company before buying all these second hand Samung/Motorola phones through craigslist just to save money, when I can buy a comparable phone brand new for a price that is cheaper. This phone is just an improved version of the Honor 7X.

My review is based off replacing a Samsung Note 4 and my work phone is a Galaxy S7.

Battery:
The battery life is superb on this. Seeing how my Note 4 had all this bloatware and these Samsung extras out of the box. The Note 4 couldn't even last through out the day with constant usage. This phone lasts through out the day, set it down without charging it for the night and it still has power.
Battery life is about the same as the S7, though.

Design:
Doesn't feel like a cheap, cricket phone. Feels like it has some weight, some heft to it. I am also impressed by the fingerprint technology on the back of the handset. It is much better and responsive then what the Galaxy S7 has. I never had to 'retry' my fingerprint as if it didn't register it.

Communications:
Haven't noticed any difference in terms of call quality or signal. Yet, my carrier is AT&T. The only concern is that the phone doesn't support 5G Wi-Fi.

Camera.
Unless something was wrong with my Samsung Note 4, this camera is much better than the Note, but similar to what the S7 has, or maybe even less.

Display:
I can't tell if this is part of the android or part of Huawei, but there are animations in the display which are interesting. From where you can see the display brightness slider move automatically to where texts seem to 'bounce' when you scroll through them. There is little bloatware and I like the drawer design of the apps. Screen is also bigger than my Note 4.

Also some people state the charging cable is different, yet my cord that charges my samsung phones can charge this phone.

At the end of the day, this phone can do everything a $1,200 phone can do.

Update Six Months Later:
Phone still going strong. My only major issue is that GPS is horrible with this phone. From Waze to Google Maps, the signal isn't consistent and drops when it comes to GPS. Never experienced anything like this, and it's been like this day one."
B0791VS3N9,Chad Bender,5,"UPDATE: Released Android 8.0 today, 5/16/2018. Update is nice and seems quicker navigating apps.

I've had the phone for a little over the week, and it's just plain awesome. I am a techy, however, I didn't want to spend $700-1000 on the new flagship phones. This has exceeded my expectations by far: the processing is extremely fast, the fingerprint is flawless, the EMUI is neat, and the camera is awesome as well. My wife has an iPhone 7 ($750) from At&t and this Mate SE beats it spec wise except for a few things. In my comparing, the iPhone 7 has 4k video recording, and 1080p recording with the front facing camera. However, the front facing camera of this Mate SE has 720p recording which is still high quality. The Mate SE does not film in 4k, however, in my opinion, it makes up for this with the variable apperture. The screen for the Mate SE is very large and has a good brightness with auto-brightness adjustment sensitivity. It is very clear and responsive to your touch. Day to day tasks are a breeze, email, internet, YouTube, etc. You will enjoy your new phone, even if your coming from the top brands.

P.s. this phone has a document explorer with a great UI. I know this will come in handy for downloading files and reopening them.

Overall I rate 5 ð. You just can't beat the quality for price."
B0791VS3N9,Joel Garcia,1,"My GPS stopped working and when I sent it in for repair, I received a notice indicating it had been damaged by liquid. The phone has never sustained any damage by liquid."
B0791VS3N9,Strawberry Strawberry,5,"Totally blown away....... I was going to buy a Samsung S9 and so glad I didn't pull the trigger. This phone has to be the biggest secret out there. I had no idea that budget phones were of this quality. Seriously, this looks and feels like a $900 phone. I couldn't be more pleased.......if you are on the fence on buying this, don't hesitate."
B0791VS3N9,GParent,5,"I've had the phone for a couple of weeks now and I love it. Fingerprint sensor is instantaneous, the phone is fast as heck, the camera takes incredible photos, the bluetooth has good range and is dependably stable. I bought another case but haven't even unpackaged it because I like the clear gel case that comes with it so much. Plenty of memory to keep everything snappy. And enough room to load more than I need. The price is unbeatable and I couldn't be happier with this phone. If there's a better phone in this price range I haven't seen it."
B0791VS3N9,SG,5,"Not much to add as far as what others have already said about this phone. I too was coming off a 3 year old Galaxy S6 Edge which is now in its time to fail period. This phone blows it away in almost every aspect and the S6 was the premium flagship that outclassed the previous versions by quite a lot. Now budget phones are beating the former best phones on the market not that long ago, truly amazing. This modified Android I actually like better then stock, it's simple and intuitive. Internet, fingerprint reader, everything is just fast! Love that it still has a straight headphone jack! Don't you dare change that please!
Camera is more then good enough but I'm not a picture fanatic so it might not work for those looking for real high end photos from a phone. The AMOLED screen of the old Galaxies are still better then this but not enough to not still make this phone overall better hardware/price wise. The only con I see is not directly related to the phone, and that is case availability. I used to love that Otterbox Defender with a built in screen protector available for previous Galaxy versions. Sadly Otterbox has mostly given up on that and making cases for any other manufacturers besides Apple and Samsung. I ordered a soft pouch for extra protection. I do like that this is a plus size phone, I will never go back to smaller. Buy this phone, you will not be disappointed."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"I got this phone yesterday on 6/2/18 and am mostly very pleased. I will update if things change but here's my initial opinion on this phone.

Screen/display: 10/10 - crisp, bright, beautiful display. It reminds me of using an iPhone OS.

Speed: 10/10- no lags, fingerprint sensor opens lightning fast. No hiccups so far. I like that I can add multipe fingerprints and can use the fingerprint to open certain secure apps on my phone.

GPS: 6/10 - I've only used it once, but I think it was a little uncertain as to where I was. Good thing I actually knew where I was going. But GPS is something I highly depend on so I'm a little disappointed. Will use more and update as needed.

------ 6/5/18 UPDATE: GPS 10/10 - I've since changed some settings on my GPS to make it more accurate. It is very fast with finding my location,and re-routing if necessary, and GPS signal seems to be accurate.

Camera: 7/10 -coming from a Blu studio one which took pretty decent pics (I think was 12 mp) and a Samsung Galaxy amp prime which took very average pictures (with an even lower mp rating), I'm not overly impressed or disappointed. The camera is ok, but nothing too incredible in my opinion.

Sound: 5/10 - I feel this is very quiet. I had alarms wake me which I barely heard. I turned the volume up so we will see if that solves. Sound clarity on calls appears decent. As someone who connects phone to car via Bluetooth daily, I was pretty disappointed in lack of bass while playing songs. I will test it out more and update accordingly.

Battery: 8/10 - I got the phone about 60% charged and when I went to charge to 100, it took at least 2-3 hours. I was surprised at how slowly it seemed to charge. I slept with it on the charger last night since I like to start the day at 100% so today will be the first day on full battery to test the battery life.

------ 6/5/18 UPDATE: Battery 9.5/10. I just used my phone from 100% to 2% (it wouldn't discharge below that, and gave a 30 second warning stating the phone was shutting off because the battery is empty). It lasted 2 full days ( I was hoping I could get 2.5 or 3 days) without additional charging and that it with a lot of screen-on time surfing the web, downloading apps, social media, etc (nothing too heavy like gaming). While I was at work today I did not check my phone however the charge seemed to stay pretty much put as I hoped it would do (even with syncs, wifi, GPS/location, and Bluetooth all turned on). I have had phones that would discharge as much as 10-20% just sitting in my purse/locker untouched. Also, I put it on the charger tonight when it died and it charged up from 2% to 75% in less than 1 hour. I'm not sure why the initial partial charge took so long, but this seems promising!

Again, I've had the phone for less than 24 hours, so this is just my initial review and will change as I use and experience it more."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"They want you to agree to give up all of your information to their company and affiliates in order to use their phone any way they want to and can change the terms at anytime and do whatever they want to with your information. There isn't any other way to bypass it. If you value your privacy, don't get this phone. It is amazing how many people have no problem trading their info for a cheaper phone. I had no idea they were going to do that when I bought this, but I'm returning the phone."
B0791VS3N9,GM,4,"Overall I'm pleased with the phone. It has just about every feature I'd want at a price point that is sane. Updated to Oreo right away. Not perfectly responsive but way better than I'm used to. I've read about a lot of problems with Huawei and Fitbit devices, but my Charge 2 seems to be working fine after some patience with it's first sync. EMUI is fine; just a different flavor of essentially the same stuff as stock Android. A nice surprise was FM radio is supported with wired headphones plugged in and a preloaded app. Also it comes with a decent clear case.

Can't necessarily complain about it having USB micro, non-AMOLED screen, GSM only, single speaker. If you want the whole enchilada go buy a phone that is four times the price.

My few unpleasant surprises:
* The biggest one: no support for wake with ""Ok Google"". You'll have to press a button on screen every time you want to give voice commands. I actually miss this from my Nexus 5X that died and kind of expect it on any Android phone now. Kind of a big deal. Otherwise this might have been five stars.
* The automatic screen brightness tends to adjust too dark fairly often and I need to turn it back up.
* Bluetooth seems to stutter audio streams randomly (half second of silence then continued audio occasionally) but not often or consistent enough to warrant returning the phone.
* Camera is not great for low light or even moderate motion is bright daylight. Your dog will need to be still if you want crisp pictures.
* Huawei has their own OS-integrated versions of basic apps such as contacts, dialer, SMS, music that you can't uninstall. Whatever though. Maybe someday we'll get stock Android."
B0791VS3N9,Anonymous8632,3,"So this is the 3rd or 4th phone I've ordered from Amazon lately. The first ones simply died/froze up all of a sudden. Just got this one a few days and it's operating OK so far. HOWEVER, I've discovered it doesn't support 5G Wifi, which I just assumed ALL phones did now. AND I just discovered it doesn't support Wifi calling, which, again, I thought ALL phones supported. So this means if I'm in an area where the cell coverage is weak, too bad. I can, and do, have an excellent Wifi router, which I could use to make Wifi calls with many, many other phones, but not this one. Back to the drawing board or, more likely, another retailer, and I am an AVID Amazon shopper. More lessons learned, the hard way.."
B0791VS3N9,Josh,5,"There is no other way to put it, this is an excellent device at excellent value. The only complaint I have is the confusion with how many devices there are from Huawei for different markets. I purchased 2 phones BEFORE this one. First a Nexus 6P (more for Google, but because Huawei built this phone I was more comfortable trying a pure Huawei phone afterwards) then an Honor 7X. This is where I had some trouble, because I purchased the international version, which was not made clear as to what networks it supports in the U.S, and many different websites have conflicting information based on whether you pull up the 3GB RAM model VS the 4GB RAM model. It's difficult to have confidence in your purchase when buying elsewhere, but buying the Mate SE from Amazon definitely gave me security and confidence in the choice I was making.

As for the device. WOW... I knew I wanted to get it for the extra gig of ram and the Octa-core processor, but this phone continues to impress. I haven't had a single hick-up or issue with anything so far, if it weren't for the network issue I would have never gotten rid of the 4GB RAM 7X, the Mate SE makes you very happy that Huawei is working with American distributors because this is a very underrated device. Shipped and arrived next-day, effortless sync, Android experience is smooth, and I do like the skins though I haven't changed any themes myself. Camera is ultra-responsive, finger-print is incredibly accurate and unlocks quicker than half-a second, which is hard to comprehend for the price and something I noticed was also equally responsive on the 7X. Just overall incredibly impressed. Oh and there's a free case which ships with the phone as well, which is just an unexpected plus that makes you happy you chose to support this company.

In all honesty, I feel like if OnePlus weren't trying to compete on upper-tier financial markets they would be cranking out phones like this no problem, but they're missing a chance to compete with yet another market that is making unparalleled devices for an unbelievable cost. For the first time my phone has as much RAM as my laptop and I didn't pay too much..."
B0791VS3N9,Ted Andrews,5,"This is a great phone! Apps are fast, it's great at multitasking, and battery life is pretty good. Some things took a bit of tweaking to get right, which I never had to do on my Moto G phones, but now that it's setup more or less completely, it's just a pleasure to use. I got the gold color, love it, and the clear plastic case that came with it is really very good too. I also got Oreo 8.0 just about right away, against what the reviewers had said. The phone is a little bigger than I wanted, but it's really easy to handle and the back fingerprint reader is perfect. I highly recommend this phone!"
B0791VS3N9,Karen k,5,"Oh my goodness I love this phone. Why would you play 700 800-900 $1,000 for a phone when you can get this one. It's fast it's easy. I love it much more than my Samsung S6. I have Cricket as my carrier and all I did was take the SIM card out of my S6 and put it into this phone. I'm very very pleased with this phone"
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,2,"Good phone for the money with one MAJOR flaw for me. This phone can't stream to Bluetooth and do WiFi at the same time. WiFi speeds become unusable. Tried to figure out why. Looks like they share the same antennae on the phone. Bummed out as I use Bluetooth headsets daily. (I have had other budget phones that handle the Bluetooth and WiFi issue just fine.) Other than this it's a good phone for the money. Surprised because the build quality other than this is good.

2nd radio/issue found - GPS. GPS is less accurate than other phones. I compared to 4 other phones I own and this one is the furthest out of calibration/inaccurate. I expected it to not be as good as my Samsung Note 5 but it also got beat by a phone half it's price. If GPS is something you depend on (especially in the vertical/alt side) then this may not be the phone for you. I tried with 2 different Mate SE's and both have the same problem. Maybe they can add some correction in software but I am assuming it is an antennae / metal body issue.

So much about this phone is great but it really struggles on radios which is essential to a phone. Disappointed because otherwise would be great!"
B0791VS3N9,Prime since 2011,5,"I upgraded from the Motorola Nexus 6 (2014). I wanted a phone with good specs that would be a significant upgrade, however I was not willing to pay the price of a laptop for a cellphone. I believe these Huawei phones represent an excellent value due to the current state of trade relations between the US and China. Because of political uncertainty, Huawei has had to alter their original plans of distributing their phones via popular US retailers like Best Buy. They are basically selling direct to consumer now. I'm guessing that Huawei probably has too much inventory on hand since the Best Buy deal fell through. Without marketing or any significant US brand-recognition, these phones are selling CHEAP. You might think there's something wrong with them... there's not. This is a great device! I'm considering buying a second one just to have as a backup. Huawei and Foxconn (Taiwan based manufacturer that handles a lot of the manufacturing for Apple) work closely together. I believe they even share some of the same factory space.

The phone takes two SIM cards at once, it's globally unlocked, and it doesn't come with too much Huawei customization to the stock Android experience. I disabled all the Huawei apps from receiving updates and changed the default preferences back to the Google apps. The only thing I wish this phone had is wireless charging, and that I can live without for a $200 iPhone clone. Oh, it uses regular USB instead of a lightning connector, and even has a standard headphone jack... image that!

Take my advice and give it a try, if you don't like it return it."
B0791VS3N9,suleiman,1,it worked for 2 hours and went black after that.
B0791VS3N9,D. Coffing,5,"Bought this for my wife after her Samsung finally gave up the ghost. I am one of those cranky old farts that feels cellphone prices are close to obscene. That being said I did some pretty extensive research on affordable phablets/phones and kept coming up with Huawei. While it lacks some of the uber cutting edge whiz-bangery of the latest iFarce or Samsung Pocket Lighter, it does have an excellent camera and a processor that is fast enough to work any app one would use.
Aesthetically pleasing, easy to work and about five hundred bucks less than one of the previously mentioned overpriced over-hyped wallet rapers, this phone strikes a sweet spot for those of us that need performance without paying Ferrari prices for a dang phone."
B0791VS3N9,Daniela I.,5,"Hi everyone, this is my first review EVER on Amazon but I figured it is worth the time. I recently purchased the Huawei Mate SE - first of all, it arrived earlier than expected so that was great. Once I received it, I noticed that the phone is just a tiny bit bigger than what I am usually used to but this is no biggy - you get used to it pretty fast. I ordered it in gold and I am loving it so far - the camera is very nice and takes great, crisp pictures. I honestly bought it because I wanted a phone with a larger memory, good camera and bokeh effect (lol). This is the first time I am purchasing a Huawei phone but the reviews on here and other websites really convinced me and so far, no regrets. I do have friends that own iPhones so I can say portrait mode isn't as perfect or fast as on iPhones but the pictures do turn out pretty nice once you get the hang of it. Let's bear in mind that this is a $220 phone vs a $900-$1,000 phone. Oh and BIG PLUS! The battery life really is AMAZING, it charges super fast, and not just because it is a brand new phone. The Huawei boasts its long-lasting battery charge in its latest phones, and I can definitely confirm :)

I hope this helps you make your decision - If I had had more budget, I would have gone with the Huawei Mate 9 or 10 Pro (with Leica cam and so forth) but I am so pleased with my purchase so far."
B0791VS3N9,Linda,1,"Taking nasty ugly photos. If you are camera lover. Don't buy this. My friend have Huawei ascend xt2, it takes beautiful photos and videos. He bought as a deal of 40 dollars in Thanksgiving. After seeing his Huawei ascend xt2, I thought higher end of Huawei mate se will be pretty good for camera, also by seeing reviews in Amazon. Those who gave good reviews must be for the slim and sleek shiny look of the phone, but definitely not for the camera. Worst phone for camera I have ever seen and also screen brightness is not good. Huawei ascend xt2 is much much worth than this phone."
B0791VS3N9,vapr2,3,"There are dozens upon dozens of reviews singing the praises of this phone, and I don't disagree with most of them nor will I repeat those accolades. But there are issues.

Bluetooth, generally:
I connected this phone via bluetooth on three devices: two car radios (factory Toyota, Pioneer AVH-270BT, Bose Soundsport headphones). It runs into two issues with all three devices:
1. The range is terrible. Get any further than a few feet from the paired device (e.g., putting the phone on the seat of the car, or leaving the phone on a desk and walking a few feet away) and the signal drops out.
2. It stops working after two days. It will connect, but you can't hear anything nor can anyone hear you (if you're attempting to make a phone call). Rebooting the phone fixes that issue.
(These issues also plagued my Huawei Honor 5x).

Bluetooth, in video messaging apps:
It doesn't work for Facebook messenger or Whatsapp. You can hear the dialing tone through the headset, but that's it. They can't hear you, you can't hear them. I have to disable/disconnect the bluetooth device to use video chat. Uninstalling / reinstalling the apps, factory resetting the phone - none of those things resolves that issue.

Bluetooth and Wifi:
You've read about this ad nauseum. I have issues with streaming music and web browsing - it (at least for me) prioritized the bluetooth stream over loading the webpage (which, I guess if I had to make a choice, I'd make that one).

Camera:
Terrible. It is perfectly serviceable if you have no intent to look at photos on anything other than on the phone itself. Printing photos or viewing them on higher resolution devices isn't advisable. You can make a pinhole camera that takes better photos.

Speaker:
Think of it as an earpiece on the bottom of the phone. Don't expect it to be a serviceable speakerphone anywhere except in a quiet room.

Screen:
Perfectly fine if the image or text is static. It has ghosting issues when you scroll or watch fast moving videos (e.g., football / basketball / hockey highlights). Brightness and colors are fine, though.

Included jelly case:
This case makes the phone more slippery than a wet bar of soap. I think Huawei intended for you to drop the phone repeatedly and upgrade to the Mate View 10. Sneaky, Huawei, very sneaky.

Okay, those are the negatives. Positives:

Android OS, EMUI: Oreo runs beautifully. It was actually a joy to use the device on a daily basis (outside of the above issues).

Headphone jack: 1. It exists. 2. It sounds fine for earbuds.

GPS: Surprisingly excellent. I've had no issues in the city or suburbs. Google Maps with the PIP works very well.

Fingerprint reader: surpasses everyone, including LG and Samsung.

Space: 64GB with a MicroSD slot? Good lord.

Battery: It can go nearly two days easily.

Device: classic iPhone style, copied by Huawei perfectly. Improves upon the iPhone design with the inclusion of a headphone jack. It looks like a premium device, and feels solid in your hand.

Call quality: Great. I used it on AT&T's network. No issues getting LTE coverage everywhere I normally received LTE coverage. Calls sounded good over BT (when it worked) and over the headset."
B0791VS3N9,SomeGUY,5,"Even cell phone pros were impressed. I had my reservations, I have had quite a few smartphones over the years, and have only owned the Nexus 6p from Huawei. They had improved significantly from the 6p. Buttons have good feel, phone is snappy, software is decent. Camera quality is pretty good, but slightly overexposed in my short time with it.

Bought for my mother in law, and there was no sense in getting a $1,000 phone that will mostly be used for calling. For what it is, I could genuinely see using this phone as a daily driver if I were short on cash. Obviously I prefer my Pixel 2 XL, but I can tell you this is one darn decent phone. Battery is above my expectations as well. Screen is bright, and big. Easier on older eyes with the Android software letter increase size.

If you're looking for something ""good enough"", this phone is a hit. Politically, I don't care what Uncle Sam says about the espionage potential of Huawei. If you are worried about that, avoid smartphones in general. Could snag up a big roll o tin foil too....

Update 2/13/19:
My mother in law is still using this phone daily on TMobile. This phone has exceeded my expectations in every capacity. Battery life is superb for the light user. Camera quality is good, albeit far from modern quality like Pixel 2/3 or iPhone. For someone who won't be super picky, or needs an affordable replacement, this phone is one viable way to go."
B0791VS3N9,daniel caldwell,3,"the bad first...Lag, choppy graphics and freezes up for a few up to 30 seconds at a time when playing SOME games. and if you try to use a screen recorder when playing one of those games its 5x as bad and makes some games unplayable, on games that do not support the wider screen ratio that this has there is a black bar across the side of the screen right next to your game controls, and that would be fine except if you touch this black bar and when your hitting the touch screen game control's you are definitely going to hit this black bar and if you touch it, it will restart the game and put it into full screen mode which you cant play the game that game in anyways whoever though this was a good idea should be fired, for games that support the wide ratio you dont have this issue. When holding the phone sideways to play games or take video your fingers will often cover the microphone and speakers which is also a terrible design and you hear horrible sounds just from hour hand moving around near it when you play back the recording... i tried out the FM radio and not one, and i do mean not one station came in good, they all cut in and out and full of static.. i have a moto G4 which is not said to be a very good phone and it does have some issues butt its does not have any of these problems but it will disconnect from wifi occasionally causing issues for me on most all games i try to play if i am on wifi.. if it was not for that issue i would say the G4 is awesome... All these reviews are saying the mate SE is just as good as flag ship phones, i guess they are right and they are wrong, now the good stuff

The Good
for most games its good to very good, the phone is very quick and snappy in general use, it has lots of nice features you can turn on the phone like it counts my steps when i walk and it did that right out of the box and some other cool stuff i found in the settings and what not, seems to work great for calling people and texting, super long battery life (if not gaming allot) charges pretty fast for not supporting fast charging, plenty of storage, the camera is the best in low light i have seen in a phone so far and takes good photos, i have a DSLR and a bunch of lenses, it cant compare to that but if i need to get some photos in a pinch this is nice and does a pretty good job so far. your average person would probably love this thing. for the price i guess you cant complain too much.

now this thing is not as good as my old motoX pure edition phone, in some ways its not as good as my moto G4 and in other ways its way better than my G4, if it had a front facing speaker and mic and played all games equally well and did not have the weird side bar you do not want to touch when playing a game but its in a spot where your almost guaranteed to touch it (if the game does not support the wide aspect ratio) i would really love this phone i think"
B0791VS3N9,Jerry d,5,"I've had this phone several weeks and I love it. My battery lasts in to the second day. I surf the internet quickly and effortlessly, the camera is better then adequate, the response time is lightning quick, gaming (though I don't do much) has no lag time, and as a phone and texter absolutely no complaints. Is it as good as a flagship phone? No. There is a reason they cost three and four times as much. The thing is I don't need whatever those reasons are. And that's what you should be asking yourself. Is it ego, or do I really need that flagship phone? Because if you don't then buy this one. It's a great performer, with a fabulous display and a build that should last a very long time."
B0791VS3N9,othelline,1,"I am giving this phone a one star because although I like the phone, this is my second one. Amazon send me a replacement phone but I'm still having the same problem and it's really rediculous. I don't have no mobile data on the phone. No, it's not my SIM card either. I've tried putting my SIM card in another phone in it works just fine. This phone makes you update the phone when you first get it. After doing so, all of a sudden the mobile data doesn't work anymore. Mind you I'm still paying for data. I'm so disappointed you have no idea. Has anyone else had this problem?"
B0791VS3N9,kms0904,5,"Ok so I'm terribly rough on phones. A decent ones last me a year hopefully. This one has been great so far. Only complaint is Android auto doesn't seem to work. Tried two different cables and keep getting a no connection error. The thing that sold me to buy another::;
I crushed this phone with a pressure tank to the shape a mild c. I was pretty upset after having it only two weeks. Picked it up and the screen was not cracked. In fact I bent it back to almost normal shape and it is amazingly working as normal still. No glitches screen cracks or anything. This is almost as bullet proof a phone as any I've seen. Super glad I'm not replacing it already. Specs seem good and all loads and downloads seem fast and equivalent to an upper end smart phone. Bottom line is I will need to buy one for when I inevitably kill this one but for now, a 400 lb pressure tank didn't kill it so I'm pretty happy."
B0791VS3N9,Clint S.,4,"I bought this phone because it has a legit specs under $250 price tag and it didn't disappoint indeed. The phone is impressive compare to samsung's pricy android phones. I've been a Samsung user for years and i would choose this phone over it. The reason I give this phone 4 stars out of 5 is, it doesn't support NFC, a tool for android pay which the latest Samsung phones have. Aside from that, I don't see any advantage the pricy Samsung Galaxy phones have over this great budget phone. Lastly, with regard about the spying allegations on it's makers, I think it's ridiculous! For sure the pricy competetors out there has a real reason to get nervous about how good this company from China make their phone with a budget price tag. Samsung's phone for example is 4x more expensive. Established company phone makers here in the US doesn't want this product getting noticed I think. Spying concerns? Come on! We all know they've been doing it for years already. It's about $ concerns in my opinion. Peace!"
B0791VS3N9,another guy,4,"The phone is fast. Pros: decent camera, nice UI (flashlight available with 1 swipe), fast enough with 8 cores (comparable to 630). Cons: It gets warm when using Skype, fonts might get too small to read.

I am not crazy about 18:9 aspect ratio. With that being said, other than the top part of phone getting warm during Skype, I have no issues. Netflix, Amazon Video all are ok. I have not tried any games so no idea how hot this thing can get or what it can do if you are into games. The Wifi does not come with 5Ghz.

Overall, it's a pretty decent phone, wish Huawei releases Android Oreo soon.

Negatives, I ordered the phone when it was 249.99 and now it is on sale for 229.99. I have asked if I could get a 20$ credit and the customer rep snickered and laughed. This is actually quite common which i do it at Costco. At that point, I have realized how little I meant, for a retail giant like Amazon. I'd suggest buying this phone from a merchant with a local presence so you are not stuck paying UPS shipping cost if you need to return it."
B0791VS3N9,Jorge Haurigot,1,"I bought this phone on May. I was very confortable with the choice because except for the camera wich is no good at all ( i was not excpecting something great for the price) , it was running fast and battery would last for a whole day and even to next morning.
Well, the battery suddenly started to perform really bad and it doesn't last for more than 10 hours with regular used.
As for the signal problemas i got to say it's true. I don't Know why but when i leave a place where i've been using wifi ,phone usually has some issues to get 4g data.
So, it's a good phone for the price but it has some issues that i find really unconfortable."
B0791VS3N9,Glenn,4,"For the Price this is not a bad budget mid range phone. VOLTE works on Mint Mobile (mvno of T-Mobile). This phone does not support WIFI calling. It does have T-Mobile bands 2,4,12 - but is missing 66 and 71 for other main bands used. With that said I have not had a connection issue in my location. Out of the Box this phone updated to Oreo 8.0.0.341(C567). With Huawei budget phones though I am not sure how long they will support updates though. Unfortunately Huewei does not allow unlocked bootloaders as of this spring so keeping the phone up to date in the long run with Community Builds is not an option. Overall the phone does have 64 gb storage for a 2018 budget phone and does work well when paired with T-Mobile and it's MVNO's with the correct APN settings.

Other Notes: The Phone only has 2.4 Ghz Wifi, which does work well - would be nice to have 5Ghz. The Bluetooth paired with both of my cars - however it is choppy compared to my Oneplus 3T. Also the GPS is not a real strong suit for this phone. I was able to succusfully use GPS Status & Toolbok to help calibrate the GPS to within error of 4.9m which is pretty good. Micro USB is a dissapointment to have instead of USC C - not the end of the world. no NFC. Camera is very sub par in low light."
B0791VS3N9,Setu,4,"This is a pretty good phone. Does almost everything I need a smartphone for. I use my phone moderately for texting (WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack), checking emails, news, listening to music, uber and few other standard apps and there has been no lag or hanging issues with this phone. It has been pretty reliable.

Pros:
When I bought this phone, I had one important need - Good audio quality. I listen to a lot of music and the iPhone 7 I had before sounded terrible. There is no bass and music sounds pretty flat on the iPhone. I didn't want to spend $500-$700 on an LG phone just for the audio because their update cycle is bad. This phone has pretty good music output. I wouldn't call it the best, but it definitely sounds better than the iPhone 7 (I use Bose QC25 headphones).

I don't click too many pictures on my phone and whenever I need it, it does the job. If I really need to click pictures in the dark with bokeh and all that jazz, I would use an actual camera for that purpose and not rely on a phone. Don't care about selfies, so even if there was no front camera, I wouldn't notice.

The battery is terrific for my usage. With my regular usage with maps, music, YouTube etc, I end the day with almost 40% remaining. I have pushed the phone for 2 days straight on a single charge. I get about 5.5 - 6.5 hours of screen time on an average.

The fingerprint sensor is fast! I barely brush it and the phone is unlocked. I don't have to look at the screen to do it.

Also, this phone doesn't have the ugly notch on top and that's a huge +. I can't wait for the world to move on from the notch abomination and until then, this phone is a winner for the price.

Cons:
The screen is a bit too big for my liking. One handed usage is a bit of a pain. But I installed Nova Launcher and found some workarounds (swiping down on the screen for notifications etc).
The auto-brightness isn't accurate. It's usually calibrated to lower than what I would've liked. I'm constantly increasing the brightness.
The screen itself isn't the most beautiful screen, but that's not a major concern.
Doesn't have USB-C but again, never bothered me. I just swapped the lightning cable to the micro-usb cable next to my bed and I forgot about it. As long as the phone charges and holds the charge well, I don't care if it uses usb a b or c.

Bottom line: If you are budget conscious, need a phone that does the job, this would be a great buy."
B0791VS3N9,KJ Sumra,5,"I was surprised and still get surprised every once in a while when I remember the fact that this phone is this price is insane to me. I use iphone and my 6s is breaking down, and instead of fixing my screen (which would cost as much as the phone) I decided to get a new phone. Problem is the new iphones are about to come out soon and I don't want a phone that's going to be outdated in 3 months. So instead I bought this phone as a temp phone and let me tell you, it is a quality phone. Maybe an upper-mid tier android. Some of the best money I ever spent."
B0791VS3N9,Mr. Chihuahua,5,"Great phone for the money. This replaced an Axon 7 that I smashed in the door storage holder of a Ford Transit 250 when I closed the door I hear crunch! LOL, I have done it twice in two years. I hated the Axon 7 from day 1 - too many haunting stories about that thing - I am glad it broke in half. This Mate SE was a breeze to set up and I got an immediate upgrade to Android 8.0. Reused my Cricket SIM from the old phone and it fired right up without even calling Cricket. Google Play Apps installed quickly (45 of them), WiFi was self guided tutorial. Great pics, display. The only thing missing is dual front speakers but not a deal - sound is still good. Battery life is excellent the first four days of heavy usage. Also, for some reason, double tap screen to wake does not work on this model - again - no big deal for $$$."
B0791VS3N9,Foote family,5,"I work in IT so my tech level is really high. This is an AMAZING phone! I mean granted I don't own the IphoneX or Note9 but I do have to say, the fingerprint reader is sooo fast. The facial recognition is sooo fast. Screen is sharp and VERY responsive. There were 2 or 3 updates I ran which brought the phone to EMUI 8 and Androind 8. It's just amazing. For so much speed and quality at such a cheap price I can't imagine any better. I know diminishing returns would occur for higher end phones. Don't get me wrong. I am sure flagships are better, faster, whatever. For me though, this is beyond expectations! people looked as asked of is that the new samsung? And I grin ear to ear! Nope, it was just over 200! and their faces are priceless! I am not at all worried about China tracking my movements. Nor should anyone else! That is a political mind game. The FBI, CIA, NSA, and Homeland security have been able to do that since 2000! If, by chance you are one who can not be tracked and MUST stay under the radar. I would suggest do not buy technology. The screen is bright, bright enough for me. There are many little nuances that make me really appreciate the phone. It's quick enough to charge. But, wow I really really like it.

I shopped around the only other thing I might have changed is the new ""pocophone"" might be better but was ~70 more and too new to get my hands on. In the future I might look at that line."
B0791VS3N9,Kristian Minde,2,"as soon as I opened it i put it side by side with my cheap $70 smart phone to compare browser speeds. not only did it not perform well, the wifi continuously cut on and off, forcing me to manually open the wifi settings and reconnected. also, the browser continuously crashed when loading pages. and on top of all of this, the person who packaged it must have been eating lunch while boxing it because there were greasy finger prints on the box. i assumed the phone would be brand new and factory fresh. returned it immediately."
B0791VS3N9,Jim,1,I am give it a 2 stars because the phone keep deleting my WhatsApp application conversation. This doesn't make me happy. I am a businessman and converse with a lot of people through WhatsApp. This is important for me to be able to retain my conversation history. This remind me what a customer and I discussed about in the past. I bought the HONOR 5x I changed it after 2 says just because of that. Now I realize the HUAWEI SE is doing the same thing.... Deleting all my saved contacts and conversations. I am very disappointed with this phone. I has a galaxy phone and other phone never had to endure that problem.
B0791VS3N9,Tacocat,5,"I've had this phone for a few months now and it's great. Previously had a Nexus 6p which I loved but it finally got the dreaded bootloop. So I decided on this Huawei phone for a reasonable alternative to a $500+ phone and I'm very happy with it. It's on par with my old Nexus as far as performance and speed goes. Screen quality is great and nice and bright, it's got some nice features my Nexus didn't have. The operating system is a kind of a mix beetween Android and ios which is nice. The only complaint about this phone is there are some apps you cannot delete off the phones home screens which is kinda annoying but not a deal breaker at all, you get used to it. The other is that the photo quality isn't perfect usually, you have to really mess with the camera setting to get some real good pictures. Camera works great, I'm just very picky lol. But overall this phone was well worth the money spent and I would invest in the brand again without a doubt."
B0791VS3N9,I. Juarez,5,"I got say this phone far exceeds what I expected. If you're looking for a good priced phone this is it. They're some drawbacks no NFC but I can live with that. Its going to get oreo so im excited about that. camera is good, yes is not Samsung note 8, but it takes pretty good pictures. I am happy with it."
B0791VS3N9,Shan,5,"I have had all types of phones. I have owned both Android and iPhone. I decided to buy a device and have money left over. This is the perfect device. This phone is fast, has a great screen and the battery life is the best that I've had.
I've owned the device for almost a month and I am completely satisfied. The size of the screen is awesome and the phone can be easily held in the hand. I love that it also comes with a case. Just pop your sim card in and go! I'd like to think that Im into media consumption and this is the best device. If you want a great device and don't want to spend $1000, this is the device for you!"
B0791VS3N9,Joel Eagelston,5,"If you need a new smartphone and have a GSM carrier (AT&T or T-Mobile), this is a great phone for the money. 4GB of RAM means plenty of room for all your applications (unlike my 2GB Moto G4 that kept force-closing apps if I opened more than one at a time) and activation was a snap: just remove the SIM card from your old phone and put in this one. Porting everything over was a breeze thanks to Huawei's app that copies over all your apps, pictures, etc. I find the OS to be snappy and responsive. The built-in launcher (EMUI) isn't the greatest, but a quick installation of Nova Prime solved that. All in all, this phone is highly recommended!"
B0791VS3N9,bryocephus,5,"Well I've had this unit for about a month now and after getting used to the emui platform I'm happy to say that it has lived up to my expectations and above. Was a little quirky at first but seemed to adjust (me and the phone) after a week or so. The only problem I have with this phone is the audio. It just doesn't excel in the sound department. Not loud enough for my taste. The operating system is solid, and very fluid and pretty damn fast. I play several games and have not had any problems whatsoever. Face recognition works fairly well and as others have pointed out, the fingerprint scanner is awesomely accurate and fast. Battery lasts me about a day and a half with moderate usage. Pairs easily with all my Bluetooth devices. I'll tell you that I was sooo happy I bought a Spigen case for it, as I dropped it and it survived beautifully. This phone seems like it was built just for me. Looks classy, tall and lean but solid and sturdy and packs quite a punch (like me.) I am absolutely delighted with this device. I am coming from the moto g5 plus which is a good phone in its own right but the SE blows it away. The screen is vivid and colorful to me (and I am a pressman so I am chromatic by nature ). Perhaps an I phone or Samsung is better but $$$ is worth more to me than a better camera or OLED screen. By the way, the day and a half battery life is with brightness at max all the time. I'm sure you have read all the techie reviews and seen most all the you tube reviews as I did first, so my opinion is about overall value. This phone fits me like a glove. I turned my friend onto the moto g 5 plus and now he wants this phone. Research payed off multiple dividends on this purchase. Woway is my newest best friend."
B0791VS3N9,LARRY,5,"Huawei has made such incredible strides by leaps and bounds and at a blistering pace that they were technically run out of the US. Ridiculous shame. Here you have a phone, as with all their phones, that has excellent battery life, a really nice screen, acceptable sound, and everything on it works pretty much flawlessly. And all of this for just under 250 bucks. I still have my Galaxy Note 8, and about 5 minutes off the charger at around the same screen brightness of the Mate, the battery begins to deplete. At 100 percent battery, it can be well over 30 minutes before the Mate begins to deplete. They can put a 5000+ mah battery in the high end phones (like Samsung), and the incredible quality of their screens is still going to race right through that battery. Why does anyone need a supposed high end, super bright phone? And frankly, how many people use the seemingly 75,000 tricks and this and that on these so-called flagship phones?? Most of the stuff on them that supposedly consumers want, but honestly you will rarely if at all use, is simply useless. At 250 bucks I am hard pressed to see any kind of real difference that a 1000 plus dollar phone. It takes calls flawlessly (my note 8 has issues with calls, especially on Bluetooth), it works well searching on the net, screen is plenty bright at just over 50%, sound is more than acceptable (I am not looking to use it as my stereo), and I don't game so I could care less for that. Build on it is solid. The added case is more than acceptable. I don't understand how it is people are constantly dropping their phones! It comes with all you need out of the box, minus headphones. Great unit for 250 bucks - period."
B0791VS3N9,Some dude,5,"So far so good. This is by far the highest quality mid grade phone I've ever seen at this price point. 4gb ram and 64gb with a surprisingly decent camera. I'm using it with metro PCS and it's flawless so far.

Operating system:
Upgraded to Android 8.0 Oreo.. it's buttery.
Smooth transitions from app to app and very little lag, if any at all.

Display: absolutely stunning at this price point. I'm used to the Galaxy AMOLED screens and the screen on this phone is the closest I've seen to AMOLED at this price point.

Battery life:
So far it's pretty standard. Don't love it, don't hate it.

OVERALL: I certainly feel that I've gotten my moneys worth. The phone isn't plastic either, it feels and looks like a $800+ flagship phone. This phone is sort of like an Android and an iPhone had a baby. Blown away and very happy with my purchase. Even came with a clear phone case.

I will update this review in a few months and let you know if the phone is worth 8t in the long run.

1 month after purchase:

Phone is still working perfectly without any major issues. I have to say, I'm blown away by the battery life on this phone. I'm the guy with his nose in his phone 24/7 and I rarely go below 50% battery life.

Only thing I can say that I've experienced that isn't so fun is the response time of the touch screen. Scrolling isn't as fluid as my old Samsung and sometimes I have to tap something more than once to get it to go."
B0791VS3N9,Mounir Errami,5,"I have this phone for about a week. I could not have been more pleased. I had bought a Moto G6 and was not pleased with it. I figured I would try this one.
My criteria were 1) Less than $250, 2)3GB RAM and 3) 64GB or disk space, and of course an overnight charge that can last a day. This phone more than met those. Actually had 4GB of RAM (better than the G6), was less than $250 and I charge it once every 2 or 3 days. The picture quality is amazing. The speed is blazing fast.
I am not the kind of paying 1K for a fancy phone, yet I do consider this phone as quite fancy. I doubt these fancy phones have bells and whistles that can justify the price differences. The only thing I can't really speak about is the camera. I don't use my phone for pictures. If this is something big for you, then I would research this a bit more. For me a phone is a phone, not a camera. Still it does make excellent pics and nice movies. I use my phone a lot, and it does wonderfully well in every aspect.
The only thing that bothered me when I was looking for a phone is that it come with Android 7. As soon as I turned it on, it updated to android 8. So nothing to be bothered about anymore.
Highly, highly recommend."
B0791VS3N9,AMAZON007,5,"Drawback: I can't see the screen while wearing sunglasses. Other than that PERFECT. When I needed a phone, I always bought the latest Samsung from the factory. Out right, no payments and completely free of any company owned soft/bugware. Recently my car was broken into and my phone and backup phone were stolen. This time I decided to see what was outdere other than Samsung and I found this. Let me tell you, it's FAST, I'm a super user, not social media but actual work programs running all day and it doesn't skip a beat. It's beautiful, and if you had told me that it was a Samsung I would have believed you! Thanks Samsung for all those wonderful years we spent together but this is goodbye for me, I'm with someone who loves me just as much but doesn't cost a fortune, I'm with Huawei."
B0791VS3N9,Chiminh Vue,5,"I have this phone for about a month now and I can easily recommend you to get one. In fact, I liked so much that I bought the gold version for my younger brother. So far I haven't experienced any major lags or slowdowns. There will be some minor lags, but not so much that you'll really notice or get bothered by it. There are three things that you should consider when buying this phone which is the speaker, the ear speaker and there aren't that many good screen protectors and cases. The speaker is not that loud, but for $250 I can't complain. When making a call you might want to be in a quiet place. I found myself having trouble hearing the person, but the audio is clear. I've bought a few screen protectors and most of them don't fit or causes the rainbow edge effect. My advice is to not purchase any temper glass screen protectors for this phone.There are many cases but the quality isn't that great. Right now, I'm using this case https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794ZYN4D/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and although it doesn't have the best grip I like it a lot. It is a bit bulky but I like my phone to be a bit bulky so consider this when purchasing this case. Besides these three issues, this phone is fantastic and a major go. The screen is huge, the camera is decent but I don't use it that often, the phone is fast with no feelings of slowness, and the fingerprint sensor is usually accurate and really fast. So far $250 I think this is an absolute buy and a great deal. It is also said that it will be updated to Android 8.0 but don't quote me on this."
B0791VS3N9,J. Weaver,4,"Arrived on 12/31/2018 to replace my old phone which had broken.
Things I like:
1) Very simple setup once you enter Google credentials. It even copies over your application data
2) Beautiful phone, thin and sleek-looking. Huawei logo below the screen is understated and does not detract from the appearance
3) Comes with cheap, clear plastic case
4) Fast performance
5) Screen brightness and resolution are fine
6) The price (presently $219.99) seemed to give this unit the best value compared to other options considering all of the features (4GB RAM, 64GB storage), recent version of Android

Things I don't like:
1) With its 5.93"" screen, this is a large phone. It fits a pocket easily due to being thin, but the feel in the hand is not ideal. Unfortunately no one is making a quality phone with these specifications and a 5.2"" screen. Popsocket actually helps.
2) The Huawei company has been a subject of national security concern over the last year or so. Huawei has a Phone Clone application that you are encouraged to download to ease the setup of the device by copying data from your old phone. This works great, *but* you have to wonder if Huawei is keeping a copy of your data, hacking your password info, etc. based on the government issuing official statements that we should not buy Huawei phones. If I end up being hacked in the near future and they drain my bank account, I will be sure to update this review."
B0791VS3N9,Nightengalejml,5,"I don't play a lot of games on my phone-just a couple of word games, don't stream movies, don't download big data, and don't take many pictures.
I do all of my banking, all of my reading-books, newspapers-everything on my phone
I text, message, and talk on my phone and use it for GPS maps.
I love, love, love this phone. It's light, sleek, good size, nice display, great speedy charging, and is very reliable. Never had it stuck, paused, or shut down during use.
I can't imagine a phone that would better meet my needs, not even for the $800-$1200 some people pay.
Doesn't get better than this.
And that nonsense about Chinese using these phones to steal from US
I checked on that at the reliable tech sources. None of them had any facts to back up that fear-mongering rhetoric.
So try one of these out."
B0791VS3N9,mark moore,5,"I buy alot of smartphones. Typically, just flagship devices. This is my first budget/mid-range buy in years. I purchased because my old S6 Edge Plus would last about 2 hours SOT before dying. Where I work I need a reliable battery so after some research and not wanting to spend much money, this and the essential phone were the options.

What I can say is this.. The phone performs as good or better than my $1200 galaxy S6, except in sound and camera. The camera will definitely bum you out if you're used to having the higher end Google, Sansung or Apple devices. But, in good lighting it's not half bad for HDR shots. In low light or in video though you'll start seeing where it falls short. The sound.. pretty bad. Kind of loud but ""tin can"" sounding and actually hurts at full volume (high pitch, zero low end sound)

For the good.. This thing is quick, quicker than expected. After a week of use Ive had zero crashes or lagg at all. It works very fluid. And the battery is the best part! Ive had the screen on for over an hour and I am at 91%.. I'm not used to that. Sure, the Essential phone would have had a better processor and camera (maybe) but with 4 gigs of ram, and a killer SOC and Battery, I'm very glad I went this route.

It is slippery, and though they do provide a case (pretty cool Huawei!) it's just about as slippery. I'd really recommend getting the Poetic or Spigin case on Amazon when you order.

I definitely recomend this phone! And service on t-mobile in norther california is great. My old Galaxy wouldnt get phone calls in my house, this one does. So it even has better radio/antennas then a phone that costs 4x as much. Huawei wanted to get a cheap device in america almost at cost, to get people more into them, and it's working. This thing is a powerhouse and could have easily cost 400+ is it had ""Samsung"" stamped on it somewhere and people would buy it.

One last note.. if you're into the iPhone's look but not the software, this phone is the one for you. Almost identical to a 7+, with excellent build quality just like Apple.

Hoe this helps! If anyone needs help just send a message and I'm happy to answer any questions."
B0791VS3N9,Joel A. Price,2,"I bought this 5 months ago and loved this phone until a couple of days ago the SIM card reader failed and now it cannot send or receive calls or texts. The screen is beautiful, the phone is solid and the right size, the finger reader is superb and super fast, the camera is above average in quality, and the Android OS is quick and the phone has been a delight to use, until now. I have emailed Huaweii to see what response or support they will offer, but this phone should NOT have failed in less than 6 months. I have kept in in a protective case with a tempered glass protective screen cover, and have babied it, never dropped it. If it weren't for the SIM card reader failure, it would be a 5 star item. I have never had a phone that failed before this one."
B0791VS3N9,Jack naj,5,"Excellent quality and workmanship, Greatest cell phone with powerful processor and has all the functionality of much more expensive cell phone. Works great with ATT as the carrier. I absolutely love the phone and recommend it highly AAA+++. The only negative aspects are the the fact that the built in Wi Fi is only 2.4 ghz and not 5 ghz making it impossible to connect with my home Wi Fi. If they make the phone with 5 ghz 802.11a Wi Fi, they would double their sales, second draw back is camera quality is mediocre and the charging cable that comes with the phone is only three feet, way to short could not not even reach my bed night table. I bought a six feet cable and problem resolved. It is absolutely the best cell phone for the price. I highly recommend it, Buy it now and you too will Love it !!!"
B0791VS3N9,Reilly Brickell,5,"After losing my 4th iPhone to water damage (my own fault), I just couldn't justify purchasing another $700-$1000 phone. Apple makes great products,but their premium tech comes at a premium price. This forced me to look towards android. I saw this phone on amazon with exceptional ratings and I decided to take the leap.

After a week of use, All I can say is Wow! What an amazing phone, especially considering the price tag. It feels like a device that's two to three times more expensive and comes loaded with a crazy amount of tech. As a longtime apple fan, I've gotta say that this is pretty amazing. The screen is beautiful, the processor is faster than my iPhone 6, the 64 gigs is more than substantial (I installed a 64g micro SD (another benefit over apple) so memory is effectively 128g), and the fingerprint sensor is faster and more effective than any sensor I've used before. It's thin, lightweight, feels good in the hand and the nav buttons are intuitive and easy to use. Perhaps my favorite feature is the battery. Even as I write this review I've been using the device pretty heavily today (at least 7 hours of moderate to heavy use) and I'm still sitting at 82% battery. That's phenomenal.

The front camera is great, mostly when using the pro mode, although it's easy to wash out pics especially in high sun without adjusting the settings. The selfie camera does leave a bit to be desired (image quality seems lower than the 8mp they advertise, sometimes appearing grainy) but that's not a huge deal for me. My final caveat is the speaker. It's fine for browsing videoes and that sort of thing but don't expect it to get loud. I almost struggled to hear calls while on speaker phone with minimal-moderate background noise. It's not a huge deal since I just switched it over to the ear piece and the call quality was clear and loud.

Bottom line, this is the best phone I've ever owned considering the amount of tech vs the price tag. It easily feels like a $500-$600 device. I'm a fan.

PS the Chinese government has yet to contact me and my credit card accounts remain secure. I think we can stand on the huawei tech threat."
B0791VS3N9,Tipscorner,3,"So, all of you have likely read a lot of pros and cons about the phone. I did likewise and thought-Wow...finally a very good (not excellent, but thats not necessary) for a very reasonable price. So I got it. Initially really liked it...big display, fairly quick, etc... Eventually did not work out. Here is why (1) Processor speed-I use the gps a lot. I found that too many times, I was just passing the street when it told me to turn...that never happened with my Galaxy. (2) related to this, GPS was more inaccurate than any other phone I had bought in recent years. I heard some other reviews say this, but ignored. I live in Boston and need high accuracy. (3) phone quality-I also changed cell phone carriers so not sure to blame the phone or the carrier, but got terrible reception at my house and other locations. (4) minor compared to the rest, but the sound quality of the speaker was a big step down. Eventually, I ended up biting the bullet and getting a new Galaxy...I am not in deep love with it either, but wow, the processor is amazing...so fast!!! I just noticed that Amazon dropped the price again of the S9, so not as cost prohibitive...might want to at least consider that or another phone."
B0791VS3N9,Dave Vierling,5,Without question this is the best phone I have ever owned. I was a little worried about purchasing a product by a company I have never heard of before. Once I got the phone I was immediately impressed. It came in a very nice package and set-up was rather easy. Later finding out that Huawei is the largest tele- communication company in the world it even made me feel better. Before ordering this phone I read a lot of the reviews and most were very favorable to the product. The ones that weren't favorable were mostly about the pictures. I found the pictures to be very nice. You can even adjust the settings like on a regular 35mm camera to get the best picture possible. This phone even came with a clear case which is made of clear rubber and helps a great deal to hold on to the phone. I would highly recommend this phone to anybody wanting to buy a new Android phone. The battery last all day as well. This phone would be a great buy at twice the price but at $230.00 it's a steal.
B0791VS3N9,KAS,5,"OK - yes this is a 'cheap Chinese phone', but it is fast, has a good feel, and plenty of battery life for the way I use it.
It also cam with a minimal amount of blot ware, which is a huge plus! Yes, it probably has spyware installed, many phones do, but I am not stupid enough to have private information on my phone. Duh!
The 4 GB of RAM, and the built-in 64 GB of storage is more than I'm likely to need, but if I do need more then the 128 GB micro SD card I installed has that covered.
With my previous phone (BLU), if I tried to listen to music on my BT headset with the phone in my pocket, it would drop in and out frequently. With this phone I have a solid connection all the time, including up to 20 feet away from the phone. Sweet!
The camera takes sharp, clear pictures. No it does not have image stabilization - darn it (grin) but I am satisfied with what it does. Give them 2 years and I bet they will have that covered as well.
The screen is sharp and clear and I can comfortably watch movies or read for hours without fatigue. A real plus!"
B0791VS3N9,Deep Breath - Fast Run,5,"I popped in my Tracfone SIM card, there you go, 4G LTE! I had troubles with other international stocks, not this one. Excellent build quality, blazing fast 2.4 GHz processor, ample storage space, smooth sound, user friendly and beautiful EMUI 5.0..... most impressive of all, the camera! See the snow scenes I took. I say the camera itself worthy the $229 I paid for! I LOVE IT! I can not believe a flagship phone costs this low! The casing feels lighter than the Mate 10 Pro, which costs much more. That is perfect for me. I strongly recommend the phone, to those can not bear infinite OS upgrades, just to welcome more bugs, and cheap tricks that slow down their devices. Good job, Huawei!

Update a year later: this phone works as perfect as the day it arrived one year ago. I can not help bought a second one. I am now awaiting for the Huawei Mate X Fordable as soon as it is available for sale!"
B0791VS3N9,Rudy M,5,Fantastic little phone. Huawei has set a great standard for what a budget phone should be. Extremely high build quality with a clean UI. What else could you ask for? More than adequate performance and outstanding battery life. I have purchased three Huawei phones in the last 3 months (one for each of my two kids) for less than the cost of a high-end flagship. I'm a very discriminating shopper and I can confidently say that I'm extremely pleased with the value and performance of these phones. Well done.
B0791VS3N9,RicK H B,5,"Amazing phone for the money

I was a little skeptical about buying this phone but it is great. I had a top brand phone that cost 600 two years ago. You still cant buy that phone for less and this phone and it has more storage and processing power and a bigger screen plus its unlocked so you can take it to any GSM cell company. I chose Consumer cellular which has at&t and t--mobile service for half the price."
B0791VS3N9,WhatAShocker0916,3,"After a huge amount of time looking for a new phonebi decided on the Huawei Mate SE and was excited.
Received the phone and setup was easy and everything was going great and then I started noticing the problems.
1. Pictures are good at best. They are not amazing just good.
2. The bottom speaker sucks. I spend most of the time with the volume all the way up.
3. And this was the worst part. The reason I will be returning this phone. It will not pair via Bluetooth with most of my devices. Won't pair with my fitbit or Garmin and won't pair with my portable speaker. And this isn't because of anything other then those companies won't support this phone on their products

I really wanted to like this phone bit for the 219 dollars I spent on it I could buy something different."
B0791VS3N9,Tina@HomeschoolingandOils,3,I will start out by saying that the phone itself is a great phone with many features for a budget phone. The downfall is that the phone wasn't unlocked as promised. When I tried to activate the phone with my current carrier they informed me that the phone was not unlocked. So something that should have taken only about 15 or at the most 30 minutes took 2 hours to complete in the store and then an additional hour to program. To say the least it was an very long day and I had plenty of time to work on patience.
B0791VS3N9,R. Clark,4,"Initial Review: (1 star) Battery Failure (effectively bricked)
OK, I don't hate it, it it a GREAT phone when it was working, just like my Honor 8. It would run logged into Google & FB on Wifi for 4 days and still have 60% battery remaining! But after a few charges, the phone went dead. Does not respond to the supplied charger or any other charger or cable. Since I did not want to do battery surgery on such a beautifully packaged/fit device & it is a gift, I opted to return it and since I did not see any similar battery failure complaints I will try a 2nd one and update the review.

UPDATE: (4 star) - So far so good with replacement unit. I set it up and gifted to good old Mom and she loves it over her old tier 1 Samsung cheapo trial phone. It's fast, long life and a great camera compared to what she was used to, and MUCH easier to see the big screen for her."
B0791VS3N9,CY,5,"I have had this for about a month now, and I love it! Battery lasts a long time, got the Oreo upgrade, works great! Easy to use, etc... No wifi calling, no 5G, but I don't miss it. Also, switching phones from an old Samsung was so easy! Does not come with a bunch of bloatware like my old phone. My wife bought an Iphone 7 at the same time, and I like this much better, and half the price!"
B0791VS3N9,John M,4,"Having owned several iPhones since their launch, I got to the point where every next generation was more disappointing. I decided to save $800 and try the Huawei, a brand I was familiar with in Europe where they've had a presence for many years. Is it as good as an iPhone? Probably not. Is it an excellent phone? Absolutely. I've had it now about 3 weeks, have gotten used to android, and couldn't be happier. If I only keep it a year I'm good. If it drops and breaks it's cheap to replace. It does everything I need it to do. The speakers are not great, but adequate. The photos are not excellent, but good. Screen is great. Finger print work well. Functions are as they should be. I paid $225 odd for this, and that's a bargain. Good battery life, quick charging, and I just bought a memory card to boost this thing... You won't go wrong, unless fashions, brands, and bragging rights are your weakness."
B0791VS3N9,Cfamily,5,"Former iphone user for many years. I was initially drawn to iphones when smartphones first came on the market and integrated phone, media, and data, and when my employer used to pay for my phone :) Now that my employer does not pay for my phone, and I have to use my own money, I did a ton of research to get the best phone I could in the $200-$250 price point and pair it with a super cheap data provider (ie. went with H20 wireless.. check it out to save more!). The hardest part about switching from an iphone to my Huawei was converting my pre-2009 music downloaded from itunes to a ""universal"" format that could work on my Huawei. I took the easy route, bought a $25 one-year subscription to itunes match to remove all the DRM protection, converted my music, copied it to my Huawei, and I will be cancelling my itunes match subscription soon. (There are other cheaper ways to recover your pre-2009 itunes music, but that's the route I choose since the $25 seemed worth my time. If you have post-2009 music you can simply copy your music without any conversion) I also proved to wife that I could do EVERY SINGLE THING that I formerly could do with my iphone and more, including adding all the extra memory I want with a simple cheap micro card, although I haven't needed one yet given it came with a generous 64GB memory! We have 2 Huawei Mate SEs in the family now, and when my son and daughter eventually need one, I will be pushing to save money and buy these again. Great, great deal!!! Wish I could give it 6 stars."
B0791VS3N9,ja,5,"Screen is good quality, battery last a very long time. I don't think and 1 hour to 1.5 is not too bad for a full charge. It updated to Oreo in about 5 mins. It takes great pictures for the price point. The audio is plenty loud both ear and speaker. And it has headphone jack, sadly no type c but that was not a deal breaker for me. Front camera is good as well as rear. It will do split screen. There is NO lag on anything I tired with it. Has awesome signal and the hotspot work's!!! Running it on cricket works perfectly. The phone spying is hogwash... These people make a good quality lasting phone. I'm still using my 2 year old mate 9 and I've not had one issue with it and it still getting updates. Got this model to replace wife's honor 6x phone. All she said was wow this is way better than the old one and really digs the display vs old phone
I will say this they had a super cool phone clone app with each phone it could not have been more easy to swap out the handsets. Scan app from one one to other bingo 30 mins later everything transferred including app data. She literally picked it up and did not have to go through the whole silly process of resetting apps password or relogin in. It even transferred all the text message which surprised me as we both use Textra . No issue. For the money why go buy a 1000 phone when in my opinion this can hang with it. Plus it's dual SIM which give you more storage space for a SD card."

...Yeah I know I said that about the Kata M4
But I think the Huawei Mate SE stole that title.
FYI this phone is known by other names.
Honor 7X and Nova 2 Lite.
Pros.
The battery life.
I can see why tech reviewers on YouTube have waxed poetic about it. Don't believe me? Please see my screen shot.

Build quality.
It's solid and clean. Nice metal back with a smooth glass screen. The camera lenses is glass too.

The OS.
I normally like stock Android better but Hauwei's EMUI has won me over.
It's super easy to customize without rooting/jailbreaking.
It's fast and intuitive.

It has Micro SD card support.
This makes me happy because I keep most of my music, pics and videos on a micro SD card.

It has OTG support.
OTG means On The Go. I can connect a USB thumb drive, keyboard or a mouse.
See my screen shot.

WiFi
It can be used as Mobile hotspot or a router bridge/extender. Best of all, it's done natively, no need to download an app.
VPN is also natively supported.
Doing stuff like web browsing, shopping or email is fast.

Processing Power and RAM.
It's got 8 core processors and four gigs of RAM. It handles multi tasking like a champ.
So far I haven't noticed much lag.

Temperature management.
Pretty solid in my book.
I keep my phone in a case.
So far I haven't noticed the phone getting hot while charging, using and being in the case at the same time. The charger doesn't even get warn.

It has a regular radio. No need for a subscription or internet connection.

GPS. No complaints. I tested it by looking up my job's location.

OK Google ( AI assistant.)
It works well enough for me. I tested it by asking ""Who played the Goblin King in Jim Henson's Labyrinth?""
Not only did it understand me, it gave the correct answer! David Bowie
(If you have a speech issue or a thick accent then you may be better off typing your inquiry.)

The finger print scanner.
This is another thing that YouTube tech reviewers have waxed poetic about.
It's very erganimicaly placed at the back.
It doesn't get in the way of the camera.
More importantly it's fast and accurate.

It has a gyroscope.
It can accurately track your steps. Even if you put the phone in a purse Very handy if you're trying to get fit.
Works well with Pokemon GO too.

Time.
The clock is accurate. Heck I've used the timer function for baking. It rang when it was supposed to and my blueberry muffins didn't burn.

Multi tasking.
Remember Picture in Picture by Magnavox?
Lol this phone can do that too.
App Twin .You can be logged into two Facebook or two Twitter accounts at the same time! You know businesses in the front, party in the back! You'll need to turn this on in the settings.

Display.
Nice and sharp! I keep my brightness level around 40% and have the auto brightness adjusting turned on. I also have the eye comfort option turned on. My eyes say thank you Huawei!
Videos, art photos and text look good to me.

Accessories.
This phone came with a case. Do iPhones come with a case?
If you don't like the one that came with it then there are other options. If you can't find one for the Mate SE, just get the Honor 7X/Nova 2 Lite cases. Like I said before, same phone just different names.

And since it has a headphone jack, any headphone, earbuds or wired speaker will work with this phone.

Headphone jack!
A thin $230 phone has a headphone jack, imagine that!

The microphone.
I tested it by making an audio note and calling a friend for a ride. My buddy said he heard me just fine.

Accessibility.
Fingerprint to scroll.
Smile or use victory/peace sign to take pics.
Flip over to mute calls, notifications, alrms
ect.
Love it!

Predictive text.
OMG. I'm terrible at typing. If it wasn't for this option, you wouldn't be able to read this review.

Built in emojis!
Lots of cute ones to choose from like cherry blossoms, cats, and fruits.
If you like texting with emojis then this is the phone for you!

Now for the meh. Meaning not good but not bad.

This phone does come with a bit of bloatware. But I actually do use some of them.
It has one speaker on the bottom right corner.
Sound quality can get a little tiny on high volume. If you are holding your phone in landscape mode then you might accidentally cover the speaker. But look on the bright side, at least it's not at the back

Camera. The rear one has an LED flash but the front doesn't. If you want to take a good selfie you'll have to use the rear camera or find a location with good lighting.
There is no image stabilization on either camera. But you can compensate for that by using a tripod or selfie stick with a gimbal. Or just lean on something. Or just edit any blurrness and shaking in post production.
I took a few sample shots.

Charging.
It's not super fast but not too slow either.
The way the OS manages battery consumption makes up for this in my opinion. It takes about 2 hours to go from 0 to 100.
No wireless charging due to the metal back.
The charger port is not type C. This may bother some but not me. I'm fine with that because I can still use my OTG dongles.

Bluetooth connection can be a little spotty at times but it maybe the fact that my other phone is broken. I'll update this part later.

The phone supports dual SIM cards.
SIM card slot one supports 2G,3G and 4G speeds but slot two only works on 2G.
And you can not be using both at the same time.
If you were planning on using this phone for business and personal calls, you might want to look elsewhere. Anyway I bet most folks would rather use the second slot for the Micro SD card.

Cons.
NO NFC or Hot Knot support. Just a little FYI. That means no Google Pay or transferring files by touching screens together.

Pre installed apps can not be deleted or moved to the SD card unless you root/jailbreak.

Battery is not removable, unless you have the tools and skills.

Final thoughts
Please give this phone and Huawei a chance.
This phone looks and feels luxurious. One lady on YouTube even thought this was a $1,500 phone? LMAO.

Don't believe everything that the government is spewing. They say the Chinese government is using this phone to spy on us.
Not sure how dust and water resistant this thing is. OR drop damage ressistant. I'm too chicken to test that. If I ever do drop it down some stairs or in the sink, I'll let you know."
B0791VS3N9,Mark Hupp,5,"I have purchased a few of these...they are excellent phones that run Oreo with Huawei skin. The build quality, display, and battery life are very, very good. I don't care about NFC, so this phone does everything I need it to do. It is very responsive and the battery does not get hot (like my old iPhone). I have dropped mine twice...once very hard...and it was fine. The Huawei skin is a little Apple like, but not in a bad way. Paying $230 makes a lot more sense then $700-$1200 for an iPhone. I use Cricket and it seems to play very well with ATT/Cricket."
B0791VS3N9,langerking,5,"This review will focus on one of the major complaints that I read here in Amazon reviews both before and after I purchased my Huwai Mate SE. No need to rehash all the stuff that is good about this phone, plenty of other reviews for that but I was having problems with some Apps. But I found the solution so now everything works.

90%-95% of Apps work right out of the box
Over 90% of my Apps worked from the get go, when I set up the phone and imported all the settings from the old phone I was good to go for most of them but there were primarily 2 that did not work right.
1. Mileage tracking App (in my case it was Hurdlr)
2. Call screening/blocking App (My fave didn't work and I downloaded 4 other ones and none of them worked)

The reason these Apps failed is because of Huawei's built in ""feature"" called Protected Apps. You will find it in Settings in the Battery section. You have to make a change in how your phone manages the battery with respect to certain Apps.
In Settings>>Battery there is tab called Launch. Under the heading ""Manage all automatically"" you must turn off the slider for App, which will place the App in the group ""Manage batch manually"". When you go there you will find check boxes now next to your App that you can turn on or off:
Auto Launch
Secondary Launch
Run in background
For my Apps that weren't working before I have all 3 boxes checked and they are working fine now!

I already liked my phone from the appearance, the size how it's large enough yet fits easily in any pocket, how it receives calls all over the house in places where my previous phones could not. But fixing this last issue, certain Apps not doing what they should, takes it over the top and it's clearly a 5 star now especially considering the price.

Update: some common defects people have reported
1. Bluetooth and/or WiFi: I have not had any issue with this at all. My calls are crystal clear in my car. No WiFi problems on 2.4 Ghz.
2. GPS: No issues, I use Waze and Google Maps, both have worked as well or better than on any other phone I have used in the past. My previous phones often had a tendency to get very hot while navigating, the Huawei Mate does not!
3. Camera Quality: Ok,my Sony Xperia had a better camera but it also cost nearly double the price. I don't expect to get a top notch camera at this price point. However, it is more than adequate for my needs. If I need more I will take a camera with me.
4. Battery Life: some have complained about this but my phone lasts for 2 days easily with normal use. If I play with it a lot or do a lot of navigating without it being on charge then it might only go 1.5 days.
5. Reception: the radio on this phone works better than on any other phone I have ever owned. I receive calls in areas of my house where I often wouldn't and I'm experiencing very few call drops even while driving."
B0791VS3N9,Darin C.,3,"Edit #2 (02/07/19) I bought a second phone so I could have one while I sent my first phone in for warranty. The old one had white spots on the screen and the wifi would cut in and out and became extremely unreliable. This new phone I have had for a couple months and I am already noticing dead pixels in the display. Sadly I am going to have to stop reccomending this device because of these issues that have arose. I will have to knock off a couple stars due to these issues.

Edit #1 (11/6/18) 6 months in and this phone is still going STRONG! The thing is still as fast as the day I pulled it out of the box and has aged very well. I've had it in a case with a glass screen protector since day one and the phone still looks brand new. I've recommended this budget phone to everyone I possibly can. It's well worth the money.

Phone has what matters where it matters. The biggest things it lacks is USB-C and NFC. Other than that it's a SOLID phone. It has a great processor and plenty of memory. It feels great in the hand and doesn't feel cheap. Flagship phones last 2-3 years. With this pricing I can buy a budget phone every year and throw the old one away and it will still be cheaper than buying a flagship phone every 2-3 years."
B0791VS3N9,Rainy Day Runner,4,"After using Apple for several year, then switching to Samsung, the bottom line is that I was getting tired of paying over $800 for a cell phone. This is a great phone for the money, but if you use Bluetooth often, you might want to consider something else. I use this Bluetooth with headphones and 3 different cars. The main problems are in the cars. Apps such as Audible regularly skip, slow down, speed up, or just stop. Podcasts do the same thing. I can't even get it to recognize my home stereo to pair it. Even with the WIFI turned off, the Bluetooth is spotty.

The pictures appear good, but are pretty bad in high contrast shots. I took a picture of my daughter's soccer team on a bright sunny day (the best conditions in terms of camera light) and the pictures look like a painting when you zoom in at all. The image just looks way too digitized. For lower contrast and lower light shots, the pictures are great. But high contrast, bright pictures tend to look almost like a bad oil painting when zoomed in.

Update 12/19/18 - After 6 months of use, I find that I am constantly cursing at this phone because of the Bluetooth. It won't go 15 minutes on an audiobook without freezing, skipping, or speeding up. When I'm on a call in the car, it will constantly switch from handset to bluetooth, back to handset, then to bluetooth. This renders is useless for hands free calls. I spend a lot of time in the car and depend on blutooth, so I'm likely going to chalk this one up as a loss and go back to Samsung. It just isn't worth the frustration."
B0791VS3N9,Rafael Ferrer,5,"I have been using this phone for a month on T-Mobile and have had no issues with it. Its a solid phone and it was worth the $200 I paid for it. Its fast and has a good quality build with a bright screen and the OS is pleasant. And news flash, every country is spying on you and you use facebook, so I think the hype about privacy issues with Huawei is overblown, unsubstantiated, and shouldn't factor into your decision when buying this phone."
B0791VS3N9,David,2,"I really liked this phone except for one thing. The navigation never worked correctly in either phone. Called customer service and did everything that they said to do still would not work properly. Problem is that it could never tell location properly. Could be driving down the freeway, and it would show me a mile or 2 away. Occasionally it would show proper location then just would not move again.
After some research I found that this is a problem with this and other models also. Apparently sometimes replacing antenna. Or putting in a larger antenna fixes problem. Needed phone right away for work so did not have time to send back for repairs to manufacturer. So took to local repair place. They put a new antenna in. Still not working. Put in a larger antenna. Worked for a couple days, then back to the same problem. Needed the navigation for new job so had to get a new phone. Got another Samsung. Never had any trouble with them before. So bought a new S8 and works great.
Was really disappointed in this. Really wanted to give this phone a chance. And I did like it other than the navigation issue.
If you ever plan on using your navigation spend a few more dollars and get something else. If you just want to call text. And take a occasional picture this will be just fine. Very disappointed wanted to give it a chance."
B0791VS3N9,Lawliet L.,5,"Overall, very impressed with what was done with my 229.99. Some subtle lag after the initial launch. However, the security update seems to have mitigated this issue. Construction quality also superb, metal finish seemingly premium. Unlikely to find a better deal for a smartphone of this price at this point in time. Hopefully, Huawei continues their line of budget smartphones, unlike many other companies."
B0791VS3N9,Nancy,2,"Battery on this phone was bad. Less than a month and when went to sleep had half charge. Phone not used, but battery out by morning. Contacted company through Amazon and their solution was for me to send in the phone for servicing. 2 weeks to a month with no phone. Suggested that I speak to my phone company about a ""loaner"" phone. No companies would ever issue a loaner phone, so not sure what that was about. The camera was great which earned the extra star. Sent this phone back and will never buy this brand again."
B0791VS3N9,Walter Skavinsky,1,Phone was very fast. Worked for one month and shut off and wont restart. Warranty work denied.
B0791VS3N9,Aven,5,"I had a BLU Advanced 5.0 prior to getting the Huawei Mate SE, and it was a decent starting smartphone. I decided to upgrade to something with more processing power and internal storage. I spent a long time looking at other bargain phones with exceptional quality and features, and I finally chose the Huawei Mate SE.

It's been a great phone. It runs quickly even with a weak signal on my MetroPCS plan. The display is surprisingly good for something that is not a premier phone; even the video and sound compare really well to the iPhone 7 (the choice most of my family prefers).

The camera, although it takes objectively good-looking pictures, produces somewhat grainy macro images, even at short distance, which was something I found slightly disappointing.

However, its battery life is incomparable. I can play music and get GPS directions on the road and still have about forty-percent of battery life by the end of the day.

The 64 GB internal storage is great as well, since it guarantees plenty of storage for pictures and video. The phone runs fairly smoothly when I run three or four apps at once - especially Google Maps, Amazon Music, and the camera (I use the phone as a dash monitor).

If I ever had to get another phone, I'd definitely recommend a Huawei product."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"2nd Edit: After receiving replacement phone - 4 STAR REVIEW

Amazon quickly sent my replacement, and I'm in love! The speaker phone still sounds fuzzy, people tell me. But me, I'm thrilled. (The workaround is to use WhatsApp, speaker becomes awesome!) Additionally, the notifications ping & flash accurately on this phone, so I can tell what's a text & what's the phone. Anyhow - overall, best phone I've ever used. I'll update again if it falls apart but so far, I'm LOVIN' IT. I had to dock it 1 star for the sketchy speaker phone but heck. It's still good.

Edit: One week later - 3 STAR REVIEW

Soooo sad - I've started having the phone jack & speaker phone issues others mentioned. Headphones didn't work while plugging in on a work-related call. And I cut out & people couldn't hear me when using the speaker phone. I'm gonna return & try to replace with a new one & will update again. I SO love this phone.

At purchase: 5 STAR REVIEW

Just purchased...but looks like, this is why the US is trying to keep Huawei out of the country - they'd put Apple out of business. And def Samsung, with its slow-loading speeds on devices (at least the older ones).

I'll update my review later, in case the phone dies or whatever or I find new things to like. I haven't played with a lot of the functionality, mostly used in normal operations, but here's what I can tell now:

Pros:

- It's the fastest device I've ever touched. Loads faster than I can blink almost, unbelievable. This alone is a reason to purchase, I'd say. I measured it side-by-side with a Nokia 6, to gauge loading times & in most cases, this phone was speedier. Sometimes notably so.
- Fingerprint scanner/phone unlock in the back works 100% of the time and it's amazing not to have to use a password anymore.
- Ability to easily split screen & have two apps open is really cool.
- Camera is amazing, both selfie & regular views. Fast shutter speed. Allows macro photography. Captures photo ok in different lighting (though I haven't taken a lot of photos against windows yet).

Cons:

- No normal text notifications. The LED is very small & hard to see, so that doesn't really work. I read up on how to set tonal notifications, but now my phone rings like a call when I have an e-mail. Somehow I got texts notifications to ping, by playing with the settings. I'll still have to research how to get this set up right. It's def weird.
- The speakerphone isn't as good as the Nokia 6, for example, when I play music. Lacks bass. I'll keep playing with equalizer apps & see if this improves.
- Speakerphone during regular calls (to Canada) is more muffled than when I use Whatsapp! Not sure why this is."
B0791VS3N9,ACProf200,5,"I really enjoy using this phone, and I laugh every day that I didnât have to sign a new contract with my cell phone provider. I had a 6plus that wouldnât hold a charge and kept freezing so it was time for a new phone. Iâve had this phone for 3 weeks and I can tell you that I will never pay $1000 for a phone again, nor will I spend the extra $35/ month to lease a phone and then 18 months later not even own it and have to sign a contact once again. These cell phone companies are making record profits not only on the cellular service but on the mark up on smart phones. Buy this phone and be free of indentured servitude. With moderate use, going on Twitter, watching Netflix, and texting throughout the day, this phone holds its charge for 1.5 days. In my opinion this phone does just about everything the $1000 phones do except the sound quality is a little less than par. But really, is that worth being locked into a contract and worth also paying $750 extra? Happy shopping!"
B0791VS3N9,nocos,3,"I really wanted to like this phone - its characteristics are great and it looks and feels like a higher-end product. However, I could not make a compromise with the quality of the sound. Whether using the phone speaker, or whether placing a regular call, or whether using a car bluetooth device with it, the sound is hollow and sub-par, worse than the sound of any other phone I've owned in the past 5-6 years. I also found the phone screen to be less bright than expected even at higher brightness levels. I've never used Huawei products before and while their EMUI is pretty similar to the standard Android interface, I found it a bit of a downgrade in terms of navigation. The phone also comes with Android 7.0, rather than with 8.0.

On the positive side - the phone makes good pictures in bright daylight and its fingerprint sensor works seamlessly. Its battery life appears good but not phenomenal. I used the phone almost non-stop for about 4 hours (installing software, browsing the net, etc.), during which time its battery level went from about 60% to about 15%.

Overall, the price tag is very attractive, but only if you are willing to make a compromise with the quality of the sound. I am returning the phone because I listen to a lot of music through my cell phone, and need something that sounds good. This Huawei model does not."
B0791VS3N9,Intelliweather,5,"I'm a tech-savvy Galaxy Note 4 owner, and I've wrestled with buying an upgrade for months, ever since AT&T pushed Android 6.0.1 on me last year, my beloved Note4 has been unstable, cranky, and crashy. I had looked at the Note 8, and I didn't like the price tag approaching $1000. I also didn't like the Samsung treatment of Android 7. So I kept looking. The downside of other non Galaxy-note phones was they didn't have all features, but I could come close. This Huawei Mate SE is the closest I found to the Samsung S8, S8+, and Note8.in terms of specs and features.

And still, I was hesitant, because the Note4 had become a trusted friend over the years, even though it was suffering from unreliability.

After getting the Huawei Mate SE, all that worry went out the window. The Mate SE is SPECTACULAR.

Setup was a breeze, migration of my data, apps, etc from my Note4 using the Phone Clone software in the SE was flawless (of course it is smart and didn't move apps that weren't compatible) and moving everything took less than 45 minutes. The heart and soul of my Note4 is now in my Huawei Mate SE. And wow, does it ever work great!

PROS:
Fast - browsing, scrolling, app launching, everything is super fast compared to my Note4. Octacore processor
Good screen- easily readable, fast response auto-brightness control, crisp and colorful AMOLED
Fingerprint reader - placed properly, instant unlock, integration with some apps in lieu of password,seems to never fail
Dual SIM cards - one for work phone# one for personal#
Storage - 64 GB and 4GB RAM same as Galaxy S8/S9
Great camera - almost as high end as S8/S9 with HDR, time lapse, slo-mo and audio control
Superior reception - added two bars in most every location using same provider
WiFi Hotspot - works great where previously wouldn't on same provider.
HUGE battery - 3340mAh - S8 has only 3000 mAh - S8+ 3500mAh
Overall experience is like a Galaxy S8/S9 - minus the Bixby annoyance
Figured out a way to make it take notes like Note4/Note8
Supports ""Bring Your own Phone"" SIMs for all major carriers. I'm using AT&T
Comes with a clear protector case
Price - a $800-1000 class phone for $250 - DEAL!

CONS:
No Gorilla Glass screen - tough glass but get a screen protector for $10
No water resistance like the S8/S9
Bluetooth seems to be limited to one connection at a time - not a big deal, worked with my Dodge UConnect just fine
Screen res 2160x1080 where S8/S9 has 2960x1440, but this made text easier to read for me, so maybe a plus.
Rear camera doesn't do as well in low-light conditions as Samsung
LED status indicator on top right is a little small for my tastes
No wireless or fast charging - but charging still faster than my Note4

There was some news recently about the U.S. Government flagging this phone (and other Chinese mfgs of phones) as having spyware embedded. AT&T was going to offer this phone in their line, and pulled out at the last minute because of this. This was a political move, not a technical one, because the Feds wanted to protect Korean mfr Samsung at this time of historic North-South Korea reconciliation. I ran Norton, Kapersky, Malwarebytes, and a others on my stock boot-up of the Huawei Mate SE and found nothing. This claim is just political BS and even the U.S report doesn't say the actually found any, only that it is ""possible""

In summary: after months of searching, I'm pretty happy with this phone, and I'm glad I bought it. Can't beat it for the price. If you want a good modern phone without all the extra price and bling features, this is it. Copy/paste in browser to buy and give me a small tip: https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-Factory-Unlocked-5-93/dp/B0791VS3N9/ref=sr_1_3?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&tag=wattsupwithth-20"
B0791VS3N9,the truth,5,"Had the Mate SE for about a week. First impressions it installed well from scratch though the Android 8 update took overnight. It's fast and screen navigation is excellent. Features like my own ring tones installed flawlessly. One gripe a lot of the native themes and images are not easy to turn off or Uninstaller. It does let the user opt out of the native Huawei apps like subbing Google photos for Gallery. But then when on tries to customize wallpaper and Screensavers from Photos the Huawei Android blocks access. So far that is the only negative. Doesn't feel like a $200 smartphone. The included poly case is very adequate. Screen is big real estate. I like it a lot. Tons of free Ram and lots of extra memory even without an SD. I feel hooked!

Update after 1 month: super fast, very responsive screen, tons of storage. Tends to slip out of my trouser pocket in the car, of course because its so big. Screen super bright, I am running it at 40%; no pixels apparent. The bottom row of buttons that were hardware on old phone are soft and change between apps in this version of Android. Will probably add a thin glass screen cover. The 5 stars are secure..."
B0791VS3N9,B. Foulk,5,"I've used the phone now about a month and can adequately give my 2cents. The phone is amazing (and for under $220). The camera is fantastic. The battery is a workhorse in longevity. The speaker is adequate. All the standard android apps are pre-installed. Navigation is very easy if you are familiar with Android interface. I have owned the Huawei Honor 8 phone for about 2 years prior to this one, but was looking for something with more internal storage (64GB), bigger display. The phone hits all the buttons.

The only criticism is the ""Micro-USB"" charging port, cable. I would rather had this phone been built with a ""Type-C"" port. The phone charges much slower than my Honor 8 did (which has Type-C). But the battery seems to last longer with the same amount of use. There is no reason to spend $900 on an iPhone X or a Galaxy S9 when this phone is a solid workhorse. If this phone were broken, lost, stolen or damaged I wouldn't be crying over the $220 spent on this phone. Good choice for a budget conscious buyer or looking to get a phone for your phone phone-abusive teenager(s)."
B0791VS3N9,Christine,5,"This is my third Huawei phone. The one thing I really appreciate about them over other smartphones is they are simple unlocked smartphones that are not loaded with bloat. Likewise moving my information from my old honor to this new phone was extremely quick.
The display is crisp, the camera works well, and apps perform as they should.
Now there is one new thing I noticed on the phone, and that is the camera app has a great deal more these days.
Now mind you...feature bloat has become a thing and higher priced phones usually take more battery life and are more fragile.
Either way, I am not likely to move off of Huawei if they keep offering decent unlocked phones at an affordable price. It is hard to find a phone this good with these specs at this price level."
B0791VS3N9,Tony Pineda,2,"I bought this phone based on a coworker's recommendation. I'd owned by ZTE Pro Max for a few years and was desperately in need of an upgrade. I received the phone, switched it over to Metro PCS with no issues, and it's quite quick and responsive. Apps act as they should, and overall it feels good in my hands.

So why the two star review? Having only owned it less than two weeks, I've already encountered a couple of major problems.

PROs

Very responsive in terms of speed
Updated to Android Oreo (8.0) with no issues
Easy to configure

CONs

Sound Quality - I'm hard of hearing and it's significantly quieter than other phones I've used, even on max sound settings.
Screen Quality - I'm a klutz, so I put every phone of mine into hard cases with screen protectors. I owned my ZTE for 3ish years and I've dropped it more than once with minor scratches to show for it. I dropped this once from my nightstand (about 2-2 1/2 feet high) and I have significant cracks along the front of the phone. In the end, it's my fault that it dropped, but the fact that it could be cracked by such a small distance (even through its case) serves as fair warning to anyone that might be considering this phone and deals with the same issue.

I'm going to keep the phone and eventually replace the screen with something better. I just wish I didn't have to right out of the box."
B0791VS3N9,P. HOFFERMAN,5,"I waited 2 months before positing this review as i wanted to live with the phone for awhile. I have to say, 2 months in, I love this phone! It has everything I wanted and a great price! You can't beat the screen for this price. It is full HD and perfect. I love the fact my phone just upgraded to the latest Android OS, Oreo 8.0. It has plenty of on board storage and the 4gb ram is all I need! The camera is fine and the battery lasts me for 2 - 3 days! All i can say is it is a lot of value for the price! I am very happy!"
B0791VS3N9,Ed Mathews,4,"I did quite a bit of research on different android phones and finally decided the Huawei Mate SE had the most bang for the buck. The 64 GB drive and 4 GB RAM was a major deciding point as well as the compatibility with T-Mobile. I have only had the phone for a few days, but the setup was a breeze transferring from another phone as well as personalizing the phone to my likes. After starting the phone up, the updates to Android 8 were immediate and the enhancements by the update are nice. The Huawei website has a lot of useful information concerning the Mate SE that I found extremely helpful, from camera use as well as other programs and features. I am amazed at the quality of the photos I have taken so far, and realize there is a learning curve, so I am sure they will get better as I use the camera more. I have the camera set for a watermark on photos but is easy to turn it off as well as use other watermarks. The screen resolution is also amazing, videos play smoothly and are crystal clear. Sound quality is not bad, although I tend to use headphones. And the phone and messaging are flawless. All in all, I highly recommend this phone, for the very reasonable price you are getting a high quality phone, and Amazon is great with fast shipping and service."
B0791VS3N9,JDoll,3,"Decent phone. Absolutely not waterproof. Dropped it in the pool with a case on it, removed it within one second of it touching the water, took the cover off and dried it immediately with a towel and in the sun. I had no issues until a day it bugged out on me a bit and finally had no reception. I figured that's my bad but most phones are at least water resistant.. coming from an S5 that I would drop in my water at restaurants as a hat trick and take underwater photos and videos in the ocean with it was very disappointing to see they didn't seal the phone one bit.

I bought a replacement as again I did like the phone and the replacements GPS doesn't work. Very dissatisfied with that as I commute 4 hours daily and use Waze for traffic... Since the phone has no warranty I'm stuck with it... And do I really want to buy another phone? I could have gotten a similar Galaxy phone for the price I've spent so far...."
B0791VS3N9,Molie J. Moleface,4,"This was purchased as a replacement for my broken OnePlus 5T which was a beast of a phone. My 4 star rating is relative to its price, don't compare this to a Samsung S9 or iPhoneX.

Summary: Get this phone to save money, get a large display, and the current design style. Its reasonably good for gaming, watching movies and everything else you want from a smart phone. BUT, as I said, its no iPhoneX or S9.

Pros:
Price â Mate SE $250 vs. $1000 for the cool phones. I've had expensive phones, they're not worth the extra $750 IMO.
Looks â It looks as good as most highend phones.
Battery Life â At 100% charge I start my day at 5:30AM: Gaming 1hr, Youtube for 1hr, GPS track my jog 1hr, google maps, web browse for an entire day and still have maybe 15% by bed time at 11pm.
Weight â Its light for its size
Screen Resolution â FHD+ | 2160 x 1080 ... It's not QHD, but anyone who says they can tell the difference on a 6"" screen must have superhuman eyes.

Cons:
WiFi â Connects to 2G not 5G for me. Thats ok, still plenty fast.
NFC â No NFC. That's ok for me.
USB â Uses old school Micro USB vs. USB-C. This is good and bad.
Charge Time â 1% between 1.5 minutes to 2 minutes. SLOW.
UI â Example: Accessing the camera options is confusing.
Crashes often when I have Youtube playing in the background but not when I'm actively watching.

Its a phone made in China, so it may be spying on me and sending my data back to the Chinese Government. But that's ok, I'm not looking at anything worth their time and most likely you aren't either."
B0791VS3N9,Chris S.,5,"This device is awesome! I've had it for a few weeks now and am completely satisfied coming from a galaxy s6 active. I paid $700+ for my Galaxy s6 almost 3 years ago and was the best phone I've had until now. The screen is nice and large and pictures are great! The fingerprint scanner is instantaneous. I don't mind microUSB since I've never had type c to miss it. The phone is lagless and snappy.

The battery life is ridiculous. I have had 19 hour days and I have never seen my battery lower than 50%. Incredible

Buy this phone!!!!"
B0791VS3N9,CyberShopper777,5,"When my Fire Phone (my first introduction to a smart phone) finally bit the dust, I searched for days for a replacement. Until I got my Huawei, I had no idea what I'd been missing using the Fire Phone. This phone is feature-rich and amazingly fast online. Text messages seem to save forever. And why not--with 64GB of memory. I have mine loaded with apps, games, and photos, and I still have 2/3 of the space available. This phone is actually faster and more reliable than my desktop computer for almost any online function. Oh, and it makes phone calls too--nice clear phone calls."
B0791VS3N9,patrick,4,"After several years of purchasing top tier phones, I got tired of spending that kind of money on a PHONE. Spending around 1K to make phone calls, check email, IG, surf, and watch the occasional Youtube video is ludicrous.

Coming from a Galaxy Note 6, I wasn't prepared to be impressed at this price point, but I am.

Pros:

Price point - I mean, seriously.
Size - great to hold. Slim and the 18:9 screen makes the shape comfortable.
Quick - the processor is quite quick and 4GB of RAM is nice.
Less uninstallable software than carrier branded phones
Unlocked
Fingerprint reader - wow is this thing FAST. Love it.

Cons:

Screen - definitely not AMOLED which is what I'm used to. This is the biggest drawback, but I understand that it would have upped the price a bit. However, I would have paid the difference. Some things look a little washed out with little depth to photos, etc.
LED notification - wow is this thing TINY and not bright at all. I wind up checking my phone more often when in silent or vibration mode. My Note had a nice bright LED which I customized the color per application.
Charging port - no USB C. Maybe next time.

This is from about 1 week's worth of use, so I plan on updating on reliability in a few months."
B0791VS3N9,Zatff,2,"I have bought several phones to use to play Pokemon Go game. I had to return several for various reasons such as bad battery, non working GPS, of inablity to access the SM card. This phone was in the middle price range of the phones I bought to try out. Initially this phone seemed like it would be adequate for such a purpose. although it seemed slower than other phones that cost the same or less. The display was poorer than other phones I used that cost the same or less but adequate although it often required increasing brightness to be visible. But now it has developed an instability that makes it unusable for playing the game as it won't hold the balls steady anymore that one needs to throw to play the game. Other aspects of the game still seem OK. The wi-fi seems good most of the time. I haven't used it for regular phone calls as my poor hearing make it unusable for phone calls as speakers are much weaker than my older ZTE phones that were half the price. Text messages seem OK as does internet browsing."
B0791VS3N9,Dino112,4,"The reviews speak for themselves. I was pleasantly surprised. It's got to be one of the best mid range budget phones on the market. The gov will tell you otherwise. Personally if the ""you know who"" wants to spy on me, collect my data and what not, it isn't anything that my previous phones haven't done already! This phone is as good if not better than my ageing S7 edge which cost a hell of a lot more back then. It will take some Android users a while to get used to the UI but it's pretty much the same. No more expensive lock in contracts for me. At the end of the day it's fast as and meets my needs. If it dies on me or takes that death plunge to the floor, It's not going to break the bank. Dual Sims make overseas trips much cheaper, just pick up a cheap prepaid sim card when you get to where your going. So there you go, this phone ticks all the boxes for me. Hope this helps you decide."
B0791VS3N9,Roy Rod,5,"I have had this pretty awesome phone since April 2018 & over all I am pretty darn happy with it. It has a pretty decent battery and with a proper charger with an output of 5V, it charges pretty fast. Plenty of memory and with an added sd card, I have way more than enough for now even though I'm constantly recording videos. Picture quality is decent and has a lot of edit options. I've been using a few unlocked phones since my Galaxy S5 & and this phone feels top of the line. The fingerprint sensor is awesome. I do wish it had a louder speaker and my GPS sensor seems to be on the slow side. I am not sure if that GPS issue is due to the dozens of drops it received already. I cracked the screen once and had it replaced with an Huawei Honor screen and that one ended up cracking as well, but it is way more resilient and has not deteriorated to where it needs replacing."
B0791VS3N9,Krzysztof,1,"Hello. I purchased this phone May 1 2018 to replace an old note 4.

Major issues:
1. This phone has some bad GPS tech. I use my phone for hiking and car navigation since google maps is more accurate than my garmin navigation at times. In my city, my phone will constantly drop gps signal (searching for GPS signal). I am forced to add my garmin navigation as well because my phone will lose signal like 20 times. I took this phone too the woods many times and had countless issues locating my position.

2. The touch screen is bad as others have claimed. Sometimes you must double touch in order for something on the side of the screen to be activated. My old note 4 ironically had a much better screen and it did not suffer from this, even though it was an insanely old phone.

Conclusion: I have no issues with anything else, however the GPS thing makes this device a total waste of money. I regret not waiting for a drop of other competitive android products that are pricier. You live and learn. Save your money and go for their android competition."
B0791VS3N9,shaggydog,5,"I love my new phone, and have not had too steep a learning curve to use it. It's attractive and works really well. It takes great pictures, and easily does all that it should. The case I bought is pretty slippery and so I drop it a lot, so I may return to the clear case that came with it, which is really nice, actually. (I hadn't realize it came with one until I accidentally looked under stuff in the box). The only thing I don't like about it is a factory sticker on the phone at the bottom that doesn't look too bad, but I wish they would have not put it on there. (It's small and silvery, so not super ugly, but with a clear case it's not my fave thing to have on there.) One strange thing to me is that the sound comes out at the bottom instead of the top, I think, but it's not bad. Great phone overall, and I like it a lot. It's much better than the last phone I had!"
B0791VS3N9,L,1,"The Huawei Mate SE supposedly has an IP67 rating. IP67 means the unit can be dropped into a body of water up to a meter deep for half an hour. I dropped mine into a 4 inch bowl of water for less than 2 seconds and it was damaged beyond repair. Huawei itself refuses to fix the phone since it was dropped in water and it therefore voids the warranty (odd that the warranty doesn't guarantee their IP67 rating, but that's probably common for phones). I tried to get it fixed at a local repair shop but they tried and failed, claiming that they would have to replace the motherboard and the LCD screen. At that point it would be cheaper to buy another phone.

Had it not broken so easily, I would've given the phone 3.5 stars."
B0791VS3N9,Djl,5,"Everything is true to description and more. The phone arrived in a nice little box, with charger and clear phone case. No screen protector. The color is gold.

I was skeptical due to the reviews being mixed (which are mostly positive and supposedly Amazon's pick)...we took a risk and went for it. So glad we did and very pleased with the purchase. The phone is extremely beautiful, sleek and fast. Boy is it fast! So many phones malfunctioning in the past for us and having to return them all, this one is flawless so far. 2 weeks going strong. I'm quite jealous now that we got this for my boyfriend, I want one now to replace my LG Stylus 2 Plus (and it's a decent phone).

A heads up to anyone looking to buy this phone, please be aware that it only takes nano SIM card. Meaning, the smallest size SIM card. Micro SIM will not fit. Had to go buy a SIM card kit at Walmart which cost $56 in order to switch phone number & plan over to the new sim.

The phone is very nice. Got a few compliments on it. I would recommend a good bulky case because it feels so slim and fragile in hand or pocket. Speakers are good, screen resolution is off the wall. Fantastic camera with very good pictures. I'm not even joking. You won't regret this gem. It's an awesome phone."
B0791VS3N9,MarkandTina,5,"So far I am very happy with this phone. I am never wasting a ton of money on a phone again! It is reasonably fast and has been very reliable. The display is very good. The battery is very good and so far easily lasts 2 days with general use. I do not play games on my phone but I do text often and perform the basic things like checking my e-mail, banking, phone calls, Facebook, etc. The phone handles these tasks easily. I have only been using it for a week or so but so far I could not be happier. The camera is adequate. I read some reviews knocking the speakers but I don't listen to a lot of music or anything like that on my phone. I have played a few videos off YouTube and I thought the speakers were fine. Phone calls sound good to me. If it starts acting up I will update my review but so far 5 stars all the way."
B0791VS3N9,Ron4U,4,"Hello this review is about the Huawei SE 5.93 now this is exactly what the phone is really like , it is a 5.7'' and not 5.9 much smaller than what is advertise on Amazon or Amazon say it is A 5.7'' please be advise the PH is 5.7'' I measure IT and did a comparison with an LG 5.7'' Even the case fit both Phones of a 5.7'' from different Companies ??? .

B0791VS3N9,Rick Hunt,5,"Well, I have had it about a month, but so far, it is amazing. After reading many reviews here on amazon, I was convinced it was a good phone. I am glad I purchased it. My previous phone was the Zenfone 2 Laser, I definitely feel like this is an upgrade. I am not a gamer, so I havent tried any games, but as far as videos, browsing, and other apps, everything is top notch. Very responsive UI, no lag. Phone came with Android 7, but I checked for updates right away and it updated to Android 8 and the latest version of EMUI.

This is my first Huawei phone, but I have a feeling it won't be my last. At this price point, this phone performs as well as the more expensive ones.

Was concerned a little about volume since there is only 1 speaker, but it does just fine. Call quality seems great, havent had any complaints.
Screen is bright and colors are vivid...I am impressed. Nice job Huawei. Love It."
B0791VS3N9,morphine,5,"I am glad I bought this phone. It is a great value for $219.00 plus tax. I do not experience any connectivity issues with bluetooth or any other device. It's fast and reliable. Fingerprint reader is extremely fast. The volume can be turned up quite loud. The camera is pretty darn good too. I really have no complaints and I'm pretty picky about this type of stuff. I'm done with expensive smart phones and hope this lasts a while.
If you're looking for a great value I recommend this HUAWEI."
B0791VS3N9,OhioAwesome,5,"This is our initial take on this purchase after just 1 day, but the other half is extremely happy. The main features for him are: (1) more RAM and storage; (2) faster processor; (3) better screen resolution; (4) easy setup; and (5) auto-detection of resources like WiFi and SD card. The first 3 were a given with this phone vs his OnePlus One. The easy setup was a bit impressive though... as always, it offers to install any apps that your Google account had listed as installed... but it also has an option to clone your data from your old Android phone. To our surprise, after all was installed and it updated to Android 8.0 (Oreo), we tried the camera app... and it notified us that it had already directed photo saves (except burst-mode) to the SD card... the music app automatically found the music on the card without any prompting. The phone also asks to detect when you are home so that it can turn on the WIFI and connect to your home network automagically. OK... cool enough for him.
I wanted him to have this phone for the first 3 reasons and for better coverage, as this phone supports 4 of TMobileUSA's LTE bands (B2, B4, B5, and B12)... though they have recently introduced a 5th band. It also has EMUI 8.0 which are the HuaWei Android interface add-ons which typically include extra battery options and the ability to control certain app permissions in the phone. The build quality seems really good... similar to my Moto G5... yet it looks much better and it feels much more sleek.
Also, the dual rear camera is quite the surprise... it is quite good at taking pictures and it seems to have lots of other options in the HuaWei app... though we will explore other from the GPstore. The larger battery might have been a plus, but until he uses it more I am thinking that the extra RAM, bigger screen and processing power will negate that extra battery life at least a bit...
So far, this is one of the best phones I have ever seen in this price range... USD229 well spent!

Notes: (1) there is now enough space to install all of those pesky apps right on the phone (no SD necessary) leaving the SD for music and pictures if you install one; (2) starting and switching apps are brilliantly quick tasks with the octa-core processor backing the 4G RAM; (3) the screen is large and bright and responsive with loads of pixels (2160x1080) and great for watching things in HD as well..."
B0791VS3N9,GoodFella,3,"This phone is fast, comes with plenty of builtin storage, and fingerprint reader is a huge plus but overall I would rate it three stars only as I find it not quite up to par with 3 other awesome Huawei phones I have had in the past. Huawei seems to have cut corners on this one. Now on, I'll have to think twice or may be thrice if I should continue to go with Huawei on my next upgrade. At least I'll be sure to check out reviews thoroughly. Read below to know why.

The most annoying thing about this phone is the touch quality. Clearly touch screen has flakiness near edges. For example, if you write something using the builtin keyboard (I think it is called g-board) you will find that most of the taps to ""backspace"" key would not work. Similarly some other keys as well, such as letter P. The touch quality seems to improve little bit after taking Android 8.x upgrade, and then followed by some system app upgrades (specially related to g-board app) via Google Play, but some flakiness still persists. Well, Huawei may claim that this is not normal and could be an isolated problem with my phone unit only, but hey I own two of these phones (one for me, and one for wife) and both have this same *exact* issue. I even replaced one, and that one also had the same issue. So I know this is a real problem and not isolated one.

Dual Sim is a false advertisement. Although you can have two nano sims installed, but only one of them can be enabled at a time. The one that is enabled will show carrier name, while the other sim would show ""Emergency calls only"". Effectively, you cannot receive calls / sms on both SIMs at a time. Another setback.

Networked apps feature does not work correctly. If I set an app to not work on Mobile Data connection, it would not work on Wifi as well even though it is allowed on Wifi. I typically do not like to allow apps such as WhatsApp to use mobile data connectivity, but due to this bug I cannot keep such apps from using mobile data. This bug also seems to affect System Apps. If Google Play is disallowed over Mobile Data, it would not work on Wifi as well. Very annoying.

Google Maps voice prompts always miss last part of message playing over bluetooth connection. Most of the time important information is missing, for example, ""In quarter mile turn"". Now you must take a glance at phone to see where are you supposed to turn. Not sure if this behavior is specific to that particular version of Android, or this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Jean Chu,5,"This is a very good phone - fast, excellent software and hardware.
Easy to transfer settings and contents from my old phone.
Work with TMobile network after I moved my sim over from my old phone.
This also comes with a very nice soft transparent protection cover - No need to buy one."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"I've had the phone for about 6 months now, after my friend recommended it to me as an upgrade to my S6. The phone material feels high quality and it has a decent weight to it. Since it's a bit longer than average phones, it does kind of sit awkward in the hand, and sometimes it can be rather difficult to reach all of the screen while using it with one hand (I'll just blame me having small hands.) My phone had some weird bubbling under the screen, but it hasn't impacted usability, and if I chose to, I could send the phone back to have it repaired as it is a manufactures defect (I haven't though, due to pure laziness and the fact that it's pretty easy to tune out.) Apps run snappy, but some may have display issues due to the longer screen. I personally haven't come into any who have had the issue, but I get the prompt every time I expand an app to full screen that there may be some issues. The back camera is good, I can say that it is better than the S6 but can't say the same for the front camera. I can't tell if its the OS and the UI that limits the function of the front camera (like being able to focus on a face while taking a selfie) or if the front camera is just bad. Either way, I can't really be upset. The true winner of this phone is the battery life. You can go all day with moderate to heavy use and by the time you go to plug it in at night, there will still be half a battery left. It's a good phone for a tight budget, but let its low price convince you that it's low quality."
B0791VS3N9,"Adam ""Crab Legs"" Laurent",4,"I got this phone to replace my aging Blu Life One X. I'm mostly happy with it, but there are some issues with default settings that could stand to be a little more user friendly.

The most egregious example is with the default music player, and how Huawei really, really expects you to use it, whether you want to or not. Apps also (by default) don't keep running after the screen locks, which is kind of a pain in the ass if you just want music while you're driving, or cooking dinner, or if you hate yourself and decide to go jogging. You have to really play around with power, permission, launch, and cache settings to use play store apps in place of the OEM stuff. I should note that my phone updated to Android 8 the day I got it, so I never got the chance to see if it was the same on Nougat.

Hardware-wise, it's easily the best phone I've ever owned. The screen is lovely, there's a generous supply of ram, and I didn't even really need the extra micro SD storage space. I don't have anything to compare the fingerprint reader to, but it seems fast enough. A solid buy for $230."
B0791VS3N9,Adam Blackmer,5,"Love this phone. Works flawless on metro by TMobile in NY after calling and adding IMEI to account. Great 4g LTE speed. Camera is good, sound is great...Huawei is an awesome brand with great products This phones feels like a high-end device with amid-range price...fast, snappy, lots of space and ram, fast cpu.. ignore that Chinese spying on you nonsense. Will be sticking with this brand, tired of the insane price gouging going on in the US mobile phone market. $1000.00 for a phone...gimme a break lol."
B0791VS3N9,Howard,4,"I had been waiting to get a new smartphone for a few years. The smartphone I used prior to the Huawei mate se was the iPhone 5, which I started using in 2013. It was fine for a few years until the iOS updates started slowly down my phone and shortening the battery life. A few years ago the iPhone 5 was no longer supported, and I was left with a phone that was not too useful anymore. Somethings I liked about the iPhone 5 was the camera, the iMessage, and the form of the phone. What I disliked was the amount of memory, amount of storage space, general slowness of the phone, the apple apps filled with ads, the touch detection accuracy, and the low battery life. Since I have switched to the Huawei mate se, my iPhone is being used as a iPod touch which has to be recharged every 2 days to be used, even if it is turned off.

What I disliked about my iPhone 5, I looked for in the recent smartphones. The Huawei mate se was the cheapest smartphone I could find that was the best fit for what I was looking for. It has 4 GB RAM, 64 GB storage space which can be expanded with micro SD card, a faster processor, a bigger screen, and a long battery life. Compared to my iPhone 5 which required recharges every 2 days, I only have to recharge my mate se once every 5 or so days. The camera is somewhat comparable to the iPhone, but does not seem as clear regardless of the mode. However it looks like it has more customizations when using the camera. Since this is an Android phone, it is lot more customizable that the iPhone. It runs on EMUI which is Huawei's Android variation, and it updated usually every month with security patches. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone is very handy for unlocking the phone. This phone has been an improvement to my life since I have switched smartphones. The only issue I have been having with my phone is with messaging. There are occasional instances where my group messages are sent and lost, but there is no indication that these messages disappeared into thin air. The only way I have been able to solve this is to get to area where the mobile data reception is 4 bars or greater before sending the text.

The phone comes in a white box inside a cardboard box. It comes with a plastic phone case that can be used unless you want to switch to a decent phone case. There are no screen protectors, and the SIM card slot pin is provided. Getting the phone setup was easy, and it was easy for me to switch from using iOS to EMUI.

This is one of the best cheap smartphones out there right now. If you don't want to spend $800+ to get a fancy iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, this phone may be for you."
B0791VS3N9,Mickey,5,"Best customer service: GPS stop working after a month. Huawei was easy to reach, got me a shipping label, repaired the phone and sent it back to me within 10 days.
Works perfectly. Great phone and it seems that my issue was isolated.
Can beat the value plus a great customer service"
B0791VS3N9,albert b.,5,"China is determined to be a major player by providing top quality devices at bargain prices. Read the reviews, look at the specs. This phone compares to others costing 3x + more. Some pro reviewers say the camera alone is worth the price. Ignore the propaganda about factory installed malware, it's b. s. Last year Huawei outsold Apple globally. Apple & Samsung are absurdly over priced! I love this product, it performs. Look at the numbers, 64g, 4g ram, octacore 2.4g processor. I use it like a laptop. Please, do not believe the negative rumormongering. This devise is quality and value. Buy it, use it, see for yourself."
B0791VS3N9,Santo Zheng,1,It was great... Until it started to restart by itself multiple times a day. It won't update claiming theres an error. Also apps started crashing. The specs and everything on it just great but it's unusable if it does those things which is why I'm giving it a 1 star
B0791VS3N9,Mrs. P 58,5,"I've owned a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 for the past several years and enjoyed it very much. I shopped several months for a new phone so I would have one waiting in the wings as mine grew closer to retirement. I took a chance on the Huawei Mate SE based on all the info I could find and the price here at Amazon, as well as the fact that it is an unlocked phone. Unlocked only for this girl! Some aspects of the Huawei are equal to my Samsung, some are better, and some I'm still getting used to. I say I took a chance because I was not familiar at all with the brand. However, I recently mentioned the phone to my brother-in-law, who is a retired computer chip designer and a pretty tech-savvy guy, having worked for some of the biggest electronics companies over approx 40 years. He was familiar with the brand and seemed to think well of it, so I am doubly happy with my choice. Oh, yes. I almost forgot. The Samsung had a cable/plug that was unique to the phone or the brand, but it had a replaceable battery, which I preferred because I live in South Florida and could keep a half dozen charged batteries on hand for hurricane season (we had 2 of the Samsungs when I bought the spare batteries). The Huawei uses a universal mini or micro USB cable, but cannot be opened by the consumer to replace the battery. Before we come into hurricane season this year, I guess I will have to get a few portable chargers and keep them charged up for emergencies."
B0791VS3N9,Selrahc Senrab,1,"Endless wifi problems. Wont detect the local hotspot that me other devices essily see and connect to; at my gym, constantly loses connection. Same witth signal at cafe; no connection, even after factory reset."
B0791VS3N9,Captain,2,Bluetooth and Wifi issues . I really like this phone for the fact that it is very affordable and offers a same level of high end smartphone options. problems that I am having with this phone is the Bluetooth and wifi connection. I have never had this issue before even though Bluetooth connects to my car but it doesn't feed phone connection. I have to reboot the phone in order to get it work. Other than that great device. Picture quality is better than most of the low budget phones. It does not have NFC which is a must for me since I use Google pay often. Wifi connection has intermittent issues that gets extremely slow for no reason. I thought it was the router but the other devices side by side has no issues. Huawei is a budget phone and it gives you exactly what you pay for. BEWARE.
B0791VS3N9,HF,5,"I bought this phone for my sister a few months ago and she loved it. Just had another family member looking for a new phone. I saw this same phone on sale and recommended it to them.

The phone itself is definitely not a flagship phone but for a mid range priced phone, it's not bad at all. My sister plays games on this phone and didn't have any complaints. The family member I'm buying this for is definitely not a gamer and only uses it for lighter tasks.

He previously owned an LG G6 and this phone was a bit heftier in weight and the screen size was also larger on the Huawei Mate SE. The response times are pretty good most of the times. I noticed slight lags once in a while but nothing too bad. Setup was simple and we were asked if we wanted to bring our data and apps over from the previous phone. It's done using the Google account so apps can be automatically downloaded back to the new phone. The phone downloaded about 20+ apps and were were on our way using it shortly afterward. The apps were responsive and we didn't notice any lags.

The phone came with a cable, charger and case. The case is the slim TPU type which won't offer much protection if you drop it. All the buttons and ports were accessible so that won't be a problem for those who are more careful and prefer to use a slimmer see-through case.

We took some pictures and the quality were not bad at all. Definitely not photographers here but we mainly use the phone for taking pictures on the go or on vacations. The phone pictures quality are pretty good these days so we usually don't need to have a separate higher quality camera on hand.

The audio from the phone is pretty clear when we played back videos and made phones calls. No issues so far.

Overall, glad with purchasing this phone again at a good price. It's perfect for anyone who doesn't need to use any app/game that consumes a lot of CPU and memory. There's no problem playing most of the games and I know my sister plays a handful of games on her phone."
B0791VS3N9,Tahara,3,"I really like this phone but it is starting to come apart in the lower left corner.

After talking with Huawei support I learned that a simple 1 foot drop onto carpet will void the warranty if you have any damage that can be assessed as physical damge. Now I have a phone that was in a case to protect it and slipped off the couch, that has a screen separating from the case and they will not repair or replace it. I am not happy with this at all. I have had other phones endure much more drops and they were still covered. I can't believe a company would want to make this right."
B0791VS3N9,Lilia C. Lee,3,"I love this phone. I purchased my first HUAWEI when my Samsung Galaxy Note crapped out after only a couple of years. I wasn't willing to pay the exorbitant price for another Samsung flagship. So I bought a Huawei Honor 6x. So when my husband's phone died, he took over using the Honor 6x and I bought this one.

The memory is great. The fact that it has ability to have a memory card inserted is great. The photo quality are crisp and clear. I was able to connect it to my carrier (StraightTalk) by just inserting the SIM card is definitely a big plus. I love everything about the phone except for the screen.

I read a lot on my phone and I also use it to write notes to myself when I'm away from my computer. The touch screen is not anywhere nearly as responsive as the Honor 6x. And if you add a screen protector, it is horrible. Touching anything near the edges of the screen involves repeated touching, sometimes pounding keys on the virtual keyboard (when I get frustrated). I have given up on using screen protectors for that reason. I now live with the fear I will drop the phone and the screen will crack. And I am so frustrated at times, that I consider finding a different phone.

This is the only reason I've given it the number of stars I have. And had the screen been as peppy as the Honor 6x is, I'd have given it five stars"

Photos of front facing camera are very good to excellent quality.
Very good battery life, i.e., usually more than 1 day, i.e., 1 to 2 days, even with heavy use.
Quick start up
Little to no bloat-ware if you buy an unlocked phone and insert SIM card from a vendor
Instant fingerprint recognition to make security an ease
Good size, i.e., decent screen and still fits easily in pocket
Affordable

Dislikes:

SERIOUS LIMITATION: The major problem I have with this otherwise very decent smart phone, is that the contact information only allows searches on names, titles, and organization fields. A search on contact information using a Samsung phone would generate a search on ALL contact fields. So for example, if you wish to search your contacts for people or companies you know in Chicago or Denver, you can't do it with the Huawei Mate SE. If you used the ""Note"" field in contacts to indicate friends or businesses who participate in various activities like SCUBA, Skiing, etc., or perhaps you use the Note field to indicate contacts who provide resources for your mother or other family member, searching Huawei Mate SE contacts for ""SCUBA"" or ""Skiing"" or ""Mom"", will NOT bring up any information. Furthermore, if you search Huawei Mate SE for the string ""MD"", it will bring up contacts with MD listed as their title, but it will also bring up irrelevant names and organizations which contain the letters M...D, such as Mary Dorney and Mark David. So whereas Samsung ""Makes it possible"" to search contacts for relevant and useful information other than name and organization, unfortunately Huawei ""Makes it IMPOSSIBLE"" to search contacts for such information.

Other dislikes include:
Rear facing (selfie) camera takes poor quality photos.
Camera HDR mode seems to have little to no impact on photos.

If it wasn't for the serious limitation on searching contacts, I probably would have rated the Mate SE a 5."
B0791VS3N9,Michael L. Williamson,4,"Firstly, I came from and LG G5 and used an battery case that gave me an additional 150% charge. So, with basically 250% battery my phone would barely last 20 hours total, all I really did was play music from my music player while I worked. Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy 5, that battery was better but still lacking. This phone gets me through an 8-10 hour shift of constant music streaming from Tunein radio with about 60% left on the battery. Just incredible. Now, for some reason my sd card kept coming back as malfunctioning and my music on that would not play. Nothing that the app Poweramp did not fix on that end. The camera itself isn't that great, but serviceable. The speaker isn't overly loud, either. But for me these weren't big concerns for me. The phone is excellent overall, and the price is very low for what it could be. I did buy mine on sale for $219. Very happy with this device."
B0791VS3N9,Jay,5,"This phone has exceeded my expectations so far. I've only had it for a couple weeks this far but in this short time I have to say this device is amazing for the price. I purchased this phone to replace my beat up and aging iPhone 6 plus. No one can tell it's a budget phone. It looks top of the line and in many ways functions that way as well! It's got a large screen, and it's larger than my iPhones screen. The screen looks amazing and it's full HD. I can't see the pixels at all. The sound is nice and loud too. Much longer than my 6 plus as well. It outperforms my 6 plus in basically every way except the camera. The camera is not bad but it's not on part with an iPhone. It's still a pretty good for a budget phone and will still take pretty good quality pictures. The only real complaint I have is the feedback from the audio jack when connecting to my car's auxillary port. Other than that I have no complaints. The fingerprint scanner is super quick and it's packed with plenty of feature overall. There's no wifi calling, is usb, 5 ghz wifi chip or nfc chip but these are all extra feature that I would expect from a much more expensive phone and nothing that j need by any means. Best $220 I've spent in a while!"
B0791VS3N9,Robert,5,"First reason to buy this phone, The US government said not to! Seriously this was a huge reason for me as I noticed they were dwarfing samsung in sales and getting closer to toppling I phone from #1. If you looked at the Honor 7x and wanted a extra Gb of ram and 32 more GB of storage this is a must have. It also boasts a large 5.93"" screen with minimal bezel. Oh so sexy for a budget device. It has a solid build and beautiful screen. After having it for over a week I noticed most complaints were unwarranted since some people are spoiled by more robust screens.

Granted this is not a ""flagship level"" phone but for the price it delivers above what any reasonable person would expect. The finger print sensor needed some getting used to. I have never had a phone like this before. It defiantly beet the Galaxy s4, Blu energy x plus, ZTE and other phones I have owned in function and form.

I love the screen most although it is not for small handed people except for the shrink feature allowing one handed use. It even has eye comfort built right in. Love that. The US government has no real proof to there allegations since there has not even been a formal charge filed against Huewai and seriously I doubt this company would jeopardize their profit margin with such foolery.

If you need a honest opinion buy it you will love it, just remember no matter how good the phone apps can still be less than perfect."
B0791VS3N9,hanrow hartley,5,"What an amazing phone I totally love this phone I can't believe the money that people spend on Samsungs and iPhones that's ridiculous. This phone is absolutely the bomb for the price if absolutely cannot be beat. I've been a Apple user for the past decade and I think I'm now going to change. This Huawei rocks and I'm looking forward to getting there Mate 10 laptop. The fingerprint recognition is super fast. This camera also takes amazing pictures and it's response time is really quick I don't have to wait for anything to open up boom it's there. The biggest downside for me is that you can't hook it up to a TV via HDMI adapter. You have to have a smart TV and you can mirror it Bluetooth Style. I guess I'm going to have to get a smart TV because I'm sure not going to get rid of this phone. This is my second Huawei phone due to my negligence I had to buy another one. The first Huawei phone, I jumped into the ocean took it out let it dry overnight and it came back on and worked perfectly I don't know how but it did. The second time I left it out in the rain and it was never quite the same after that. The phone turned on but it never ran properly. I'm still impressed because I never expected it to work after I jump in the ocean. Great phone well-built durable it's a rockstar."
B0791VS3N9,Martin,5,"It's a great phone for the price. I was looking for replacement for my Moto (battery dying slowly). Moto g6, Nokia 6.1 and this one were the options, I choose Mate just to try something new. I'm not regreting it.
Body quality is great, I like slim design and material quality. Shape it great, despite a big diagonal for my taste it doesn't feel big in hand.
Screen it bright, angles are ok. It's fast. Immidiatelly after getting online it grabed Oreo update.
Battery it good, 2 days without problems with normal usage, location and BT are constantly on. Old USB port is convinient if you have stock of old chargers.
The only downside noticed so far is luck of fast charge. While overall charging time is average, about 2 hours it's linear function of time, which can be a problem if you forget about it in the morning and need to run fast.
Camera is average, while portrait mode is good. Also spent some time removing rubbish preinstalled apps.
Overall its a great phone, I would buy it again."
B0791VS3N9,Ray Barrington,2,"I had this phone for about 6 months before I broke the screen and had to deal with the minor nightmare of Huawei customer support. It takes a series of phone calls, emails, webiste visits and multiple payment attempts to get them to repair the screen at the near $100 fee. It shouldn't be that hard. I knew when I broke the screen, I was going to have a hard time replacing it since its an offbeat Chinese manufacturer. None of the local places can replace the screen. The replacment screens you can by are plagued with bad reviews as being inferior. So, if you want to replace your screen, its $100, a fair deal of frustration and two weeks. At half the price of the phone, its really not worth it.

Also, I scratched the screen after having it for about a week. I've never scratched a phone screen before. I don't know what kind of glass this thing is made from but it is soft with a capital S.

Other than the screen, the phone has its quirks, but seemed to work fine. Battery life was good. I honestly couldn't recommend this phone to someone due to the gyrations and frustrations of dealing with the manufacturer."
B0791VS3N9,Joe,5,"I absolutely love this phone. I have an issue with the screen not turning on shortly after receiving it, however Amazon swiftly sent me a replacement. This phones user interface is fantastic. I am die-hard android, so that may make me biased. My previous HTC Uplay was a great phone, but the camera quality is unbelievable. I would warn others to avoid sticking this phone in your back pocket, as I did notice mild bowing of the phone. I was skeptical of buying a ""non brand"" phone, but I'm so glad I did."
B0791VS3N9,Poohbear,5,"I had been shopping for new phone since my S5 is already 4 y.o. and I can't seem to decide on which newer Samsung Galaxy I want but then I remembered that my niece back in Asia has this brand and thought, if she can like this phone like any other iphones out there, then it must be that good. So I went looking for reviews here on Amazon, and I'm pretty satisfied by the amount of positive reviews that I decided to buy this the same day, and I never looked back! I mean, why pay for $600+ for a phone when you can have similar product at a fraction of the cost, bought this along with screen protector and case, all came together. And soon realized that I needed to go to Metro PCS for a nano sim card, and it cost me another $27.70 at Metro, but well worth it! If I get 2 yrs out of this phone, I'll be happy but hoping to keep it longer than that. The best part is the 64GB, now I don't even need SD card, plus I can have more room for the apps that I had to give up due to limited memory on my previous S5. The Metro guy who helped me was so impressed by the feel of this phone, he is ready to get his own from Amazon, too!"
B0791VS3N9,Patrick Mergner,5,"I was hesitant at first, being that I had never heard of Huawei, but with the ratings and reviews I decided to replace my S7 with this and I will tell you that I am extremely glad I took that chance. The battery lasts well over a day of constant use and, even better, is SUPER fast to charge. I was expecting this phone to have problems overheating (like certain competitors), i was wrong...watch hours and hours of video and not even have to worry about it getting hot or even warm. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a new phone. 64GB (expandable to 256), unlocked AND at the price it is at, I promise you that the ratings speak for themselves."
B0791VS3N9,MasterDon,5,"Great Phone! Updated to Oreo with no hiccups. Cloned my old phone and transferred all my data and apps without any hiccups. The phone is so customizable and intuitive. I upgraded to this phone from a LG stylo 3 and it blows rings around that phone. My only gripe is the camera, under certain lighting conditions it can be a little washed out, but you can always tweak the settings to clean up the image. I have been recommended this phone to anyone who will listen. If this phone lasts for more than a year without any major problems, Huawei has a customer for life.

And unless you're working for the military or government,I wouldn't be too concerned with the Chinese hacking your phone. If Huawei is able to move forward and put this behind them, I see them as a formidable competitor in this arena."
B0791VS3N9,India Dausch,4,"This is my second phone by this company, and,for a lower- priced, smartphone, I honestly cannot complain. My first one, the Honor 6x was getting a bit glitchy after owning it for about a year and a half, but I also rely 100% on my cell phone for everything, and that one was one of the first models I believe that was sold. They do have excellent customer service, available at the touch of a button 24/7.... actually speak directly to a helpful person right away. The camera isn't bad at all,and has improved greatly since the 6x, but is not going to be the quality of a high priced Samsung or iPhone. I've had this now about a month, and will update again at 6 months to see how it's going."
B0791VS3N9,REGGieANNeSD,5,"Best ""bang for your buck"" smart phone. Ive been an Apple iPhone user forever, with an exception of a short stint of switching over to a Galaxy s3 for a little bit, then going back to the iPhone once they started selling the bigger screens.

Well my iPhone 6 plus finally took a dump after so many years of apple trying to slow it down with their os upgrades and trying to have me upgrade to their newer iPhones. i decided to give this Huawei a try since it's pretty affordable. Well, I haven't been disappointed yet...it does its job well and I'm very happy. My wife is pissed off because it seems I wanna stay with android while my fam is on Apple. Well, how 'but them apples?!? ð"
B0791VS3N9,Nicholas,5,"I had a bad experience with the purchase of an s8+ recently and just wanted to get an affordable phone with decent specs. Came across this phone, the reviews seemed good. I have not been disappointed. Been using it about 2 months now, and it is a great phone. Battery life is great, phone is snappy, more than enough RAM, and added a 128GB sd card to it for plenty storage. It has one minor issue however, and that is the bluetooh. It can be a little dodgy, especially when switching between calls and streaming music. The bluetooth also slows down the WiFi speed, because it shares an antenna.

That being said, the bluetooth issue is not enough to lose a star, because the phone itself is solid."
B0791VS3N9,Evelyne Diaz Araque,5,"With a small budget, I was looking for something good and reliable and it seems AMAZING for the price! Having two sim-cards ports, excellent camera, works fast (which is very crucial for me), plenty of storage and a big and bright screen!
The screen also can be divided into two screen which is pretty cool if you wanna do two things at the same time. On the overall, the phone has really cool features. Probably the only cons in that the sound is not amazing, but I can totally live with it, and another downside is that it is very hard to find accessories for the device, as of now, there are none screen-protectors that are suitable. I eventually managed to find a good hard case for the device. Great value for money, Huawei and Amazon offered me a great service when I ran with problems when I got the first device and completely refunded me and I was able to get a new one.
Very recommended device!"
B0791VS3N9,Santa8T,3,"I really thought I was going to love this phone. Right out of the box, it integrated with all my apps right away. I literally signed into my accounts and everything was set up. Then, as time went on, one thing after another stopped working smoothly.
First, the phone wouldn't connect to my Pandora app on my car like it did a hundred times before. Then I stopped getting messages for my Fitbit until it stopped working with my Fitbit completely. I have to sync everything, every time now. It won't just do it automatically like it did in the beginning. Not sure what's going on, but the Bluetooth integration is garbage. So I'm not very pleased with the phone. I missed my return window by a week and just wish that I exchanged it as soon as I noticed these issues.

My advice, if you want a cheap phone this is a good phone to get. If you start to have any issues with it At All while you are still in the window to return it, do it! Don't wait till this amazing phone becomes another crappy phone you hate using."
B0791VS3N9,JustSomeFella,3,"If you have read my reviews you know that I don't immediately review a new phone, I like to get a good feel for it before I post my opinions for the world.

The Good: Great Phone, Good Build Quality, Big Clear Screen, Good Battery Life, Almost stock Android OS, Plenty of Ram, Fast Enough Processor, and Plenty of Space (plus you can add a MicroSD card for more).

The Neutral: Huawei has been in the news quite a bit recently for all sorts negative things, unless you work in government I wouldn't let that impact your opinion, this is a solid phone.

The Bad: System updates have bricked my phone twice. Once was right after I got the phone (annoying but okay) the second time was last night. Its easy enough to boot into recovery and wipe the phone to get it back up and running (I keep most of my data on micro SD card so data loss isn't an issue) but setting all of my apps back up and getting everything back the way I want it is time consuming. So -2 stars and Im returning it."
B0791VS3N9,Simon,1,"This is an exact replica of iphone in every aspect. I ordered two times of this phone. Each time had some issues right after setup, returned in 2 days.
1st - reading memory card error, stuck in the process of setup and being frozen.
2nd - reading memory card error, after setup, respond abnormally, very weird.
If you wish to keep your privacy and confidential information, do not use this phone. Huawei's devices are very famous at data theft."
B0791VS3N9,Joseph,5,"Thank god for Capitalism! I needed a new phone and the flagship fruit phone was 800.00, 1000.00 for the one i wanted. But this phone is just as nice. Switching to droid will take some time but I think anyone would switch for 800.00 saved. Put in my t mobile sim and it worked no problem. Finger print thing is really cool. Now the test of time but so far super happy and Amazon dont play when it comes to delivery in the Denver metro area

6 weeks later I have been using this phone all day at work and it has been flawless. I am a service tech and I run different apps all day long, navigation, music, phone calls, texting, and camera my Huawei has been rock solid. Great phone gonna get my boy one!!"
B0791VS3N9,Francisco,4,"I love this phone and was very excited to see what it could do. So many functions at a great price. I wish it could have worked with my service provider. I was able to activate it easily, but where I lived I could not receive or make calls. When I was out and about it worked perfectly. Unfortunately because I am a stay at home dad to a 3 year old, I had to return it for safety purposes. If something should happen, I had no way to make a call out for help. It just happened to be where I live is a gsm nightmare. Hated to return it and settle for a phone without all the great features of this huawei mate."
B0791VS3N9,Susie V,1,"It has great memory, I love the fingerprint capability, and the size is pretty nice. However, picture quality is terrible! Please just save your money if good pictures and video matter to you."
B0791VS3N9,tweberfree,5,"Has fingerprint unlocking/ID, the voice to text works great, it has dual sim for extra space and it works great. Keep in mind that this phone is not compatible with icloud so it does not get .mac or .icloud email unless you go to the icloud website, log in and then access your (miniature) email. Takes a little time to get used to the answering interface but I'm not great at using cell phones anyway, so there's that... However, the phone does *everything* that more expensive phones do and at an amazing price... and if I lose this phone or it gets stolen I'll be sad -- but not as sad as if I lost an $800 phone!"
B0791VS3N9,mrcyjack,5,"I upgraded from an old Samsung galaxy 3 that I had been using for about 5 years. It was a huge jump, and the best choice over the Samsung phone I was looking at. I got a decently fast phone, android 7os (hopefully 8), and it came with all sorts of features. The camera was not bad."
B0791VS3N9,Atomic City Computers,4,"I bought this device after using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. I broke the screen on it, so I needed a replacement, but didn't have $600-900 for a newer device. After researching several models, I decided on this one. The specs are better than my S7. The quality of materials is very good, feels like a much more expensive device. The screen is bright and colorful and responsive. The sound quality, call quality and reception is excellent. I use Mint Mobile and when I transferred the sim card over, it took it with no problem. I actually get more bars with this phone than I did with my S7. The newer OS is nice, and I notice more system updates with this than with the S7 as well. The fingerprint sensor is really cool. When it works, it is very fast to unlock your phone. However, it is very picky about taking your fingerprint. I'd say it actually works about 70% of the time - when it doesn't take my print, it makes me put in my pin number. Somewhat Irritating, but not a deal breaker. Picture quality when not zoomed in is pretty good. When zooming in, picture quality disintegrates. Videos are pretty good when not zoomed in. I wish I complain more about the picture quality, but I really can't at this price point. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this device. I am a happy Huawei customer."
B0791VS3N9,Candice A.,5,"I was using a terrible Samsung J7 Perx from Sprint and I was so unhappy with it. I bought this Huawei (Hoo-way-we) and I was able to keep my phone number by going to Walmart and buying the ""Walmart Family Mobile"" plan powered by T-Mobile. I now have unlimited text, talk, and data for $40 bucks! All I did was buy the SIM card activation kit and wait one day for the number to transfer and I was set. Sprint plans do not work with this phone. T-mobile does. I am not sure about other carriers. I love this phone, it is so fast and looks like an iphone and it comes with a clear case! Winning!"
B0791VS3N9,Ngwa,3,"Huawei is a great phone.
I really admire the phone.
However, there are two unsatisfactory things noted on Huawei Mate: the camera is not as great as I expected. The battery discharges so fast unlike typical Huawei batteries even though there is an additional support option on ultra battery save on battery icon.
Unfortunately, these 2 are the priorities in my decision of choosing a smart phone."
B0791VS3N9,Paulitico,5,"I've only had this phone for a few days and I only have positive things to say about it. The 5.93"" 18:9 screen has a slimmer, and easier to hold, body than my previous phone that had a smaller screen size. The screen resolution is stunning with vibrant colors. The octacore processor is way faster than my ex-phone's quad. The camera is fast and takes amazing pictures. The sound is generic but not bad. The battery life is good, I had 40% after 10hours of moderate use. The price went down by $20 a few days after I bought it but I'm so happy with this phone I just can't complain. BTW, did I mention this came loaded with 64Gb memory!"
B0791VS3N9,Rodney B,2,"This phone has some good reviews online. Unfortunately my experience with it wasn't that good. I have had consistent issues with the Bluetooth radio. This phone consistently looses the connection to my Sony headset, it won't stay connected to my JBL speaker, and it absolutely hates my Fitbit. Additionally it buffers when I'm watching YouTube constantly. I've gone to watching videos at 144p and it still stops every minute or two. This happens whether I'm on 4G or Wi-Fi. After three weeks the menu started flickering whenever I pull it up. Icons would jump from one spot to the next as though they didn't know which order they were supposed to be in. Most recently the phone decided to just restart itself while I was typing a message on Facebook. I've had to restart it at least once a day for the past week so with the auto restarts I'm sending this back. My two year old Blu R1 is more reliable at this time."
B0791VS3N9,Gigi Miner,4,"I know, it's not the name brands we all ""want"". But I can't afford those name brands. And, really, who needs so many bells and whistles?

This phone does plenty of what those phones do and at half the price. I've had a Huawei in the past and liked it well enough that when I was forced to replace a dying phone, I went with this brand because I had such good luck with it.

This one is a good size. If you have eyes that don't see so well, you may have to download a text enhancer for bigger text. The messages are not color coded and the text size is limited. Easily fixed with apps, but that's one of those bells/whistles I do miss; customization.

There are some apps on it I didn't expect and found very helpful. I'm really not missing too much that I know of. :)

Good value. Works well; better than a Samsung I once had...just sayin'. A good mid-level phone."
B0791VS3N9,TS,5,"I did a lot of searching before I decided on an upgrade to my Moto X Pure. I was thinking about the moto G4 and Honor 7x but ultimately picked the Mate Se which is an upgraded Honor 7x.

Shipping from Amazon was fast and hassle free. No surprises there.

The actual phone is great. It came with a clear case which was unexpected. I had already purchased a case. The biggest pro about this phone is the battery life which is crazy. I can go days without charging it. The phone is lightning fast and responsive. No waiting or slow transistions. The fingerprint scan on the backside of the phone is great. It works flawlessly and recognizes my fingerprint instantly.

I normally root my phones for performance reasons but decided not to root this phone. Sometimes it's more of a hassle than what it's worth. I like stock Android ROMs. EMUI is not a ""heavy"" interface like Samsung phones. I use Nova Launcher and the phone is as, good as stock android. There are a lot of apps out there now that allow you to block ads so this phone runs great without root.

Transferring apps and messages was a breeze using Huawei's transferring app.

Only thing to remember is there's no NFC and no 5 ghz capability for WiFi. It's a non issue to me.

Only con in my opinion is the speaker. The Moto X Pure had two speakers so you got a louder, more stereo sound. the one speaker on the Mate SE is some what loud but very tingy. Overall, I love the phone. Great purchase."
B0791VS3N9,AmazonPrime1,5,"This phone was a step down in terms of display size from my Ascend Mate 2. I was, frankly, a bit underwhelmed when I received it.

However having used it for a day or two, I realized that it is a gorgeous phone with an amazing screen and some really cool features having Android 8.0. Huawei includes a cover or case to use with the phone which I have found to be extremely helpful as well. The actual phone looks super nice compared to most of the videos and most of the images you can find on the web. Highly recommend!

Cons: Occasional lag."
B0791VS3N9,Tony,1,".......if you end up having a problems with your Huawei phone you are in trouble if you have a warranty or not. The Huawei repair shop is a nightmare and they will put you on a run-around and not want to fix your phone. I sent my phone in to get the battery problem fixed and they sent my phone back in 2 days all dented and scratched up and denied that they did it. I took a picture of my phone before I sent it and they still said that it was dented on the picture. Don't buy any Huawei phone, because if it ends up having a problem you better learn to fix it yourself. The first picture is how my phone looked before I mailed it to them and the other 2 pictures is how it looked when I got it back."
B0791VS3N9,Geek Queen,4,"It's a great phone. But it's very slowly, and can get stuck. I get kicked out of maps and some apps for crashing all the time. Picture quality is not great,but does the work.
But I will tell you this, for the price, SO WORTH it. Don't expect to pay this price and have a Lamborghini phonem. This a great ""Toyota Corolla"" or ""Kia Soul"" of a phone. Looks great, cheap in price and does the work! (Says the person who cracked two Samsung Galaxy s9 in two weeks, and this phone has survived 3 months!) WORTH IT! Insurance protection price, awesome."
B0791VS3N9,Courtney DP,5,"I switched to this from an Honor 5x, so I was a pretty smooth transition. I'm in love with Huawei phones, great quality for a fraction of the high dollar phones out there and does everything I need a phone to do. I hooked it up on my straight talk service with no issue, it does take a nano SIM card only, I didn't know that and had to go buy a new one because the one in my Honor was too big. Been using it for a few days and love it! Picture quality is great and that battery life is fire! It even came with a clear flexible case, which is amazing!"

B0791VS3N9,Rodster,5,"This phone does not look or feel like a $230 phone, it looks and feels more like an iPhone with it's space grey backing. The performance is pretty solid and the Hauwei launcher is not too bad either as it has some useful features. I'm pretty impressed with this phone especially at it's price point when you factor a dual sim card setup and the audio DAC sounds really good with headphones. So far the fingerprint reader has worked reliably to unlock the phone."
B0791VS3N9,Be Informed Not Fooled,1,"Display Screen dimming frequently very annoying. Huawei technical support unable to troubleshoot on the phone and recommended I send in the phone, I had for only four days, for repair or replacement. Multiple Huawei web complaints indicated that display dimming and flickering is a known problem with many Huawei phone models. Phone returned."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I noticed a difference between this and other smart phones out of the box. I especially like that I can completely uninstall bloatware and that apps like Facebook aren't system installments / requirements. The screen is crystal clear and resists fingerprint buildup. The phone's processing speed is incredible. No lagging. Just an incredibly beautiful, high performing choice. The price point could double and the phone would be worth it, though perhaps not morally. Economic accessibility without minimizing features. Yes. Can't say enough good things so one con: those terms that must be agreed to before operating the phone are a little scary, but make me wonder what's going on behind the scenes of phones that don't make us aware of their software and data practices."
B0791VS3N9,allie2743,5,"I was in need of an upgrade from an LG. Four years ago I decided that the monthly contract with either AT&T and Verizon were jut not worth it. I have been with Straight Talk ever since. I purchased this phone, brand new, works on Straight Talk AT&T SIM. I was able to activate this phone very easily. The phone itself is excellent. Has all of the options of my daughter's S9 and I LOVE that the screen is not curved on the edges like the S9. I had no problems at all with this phone. The phone has had several software updates and I have not had problems since the update. I waited several months before getting this phone, it was worth the wait. I have no complaints. Although there still is a lot I need to learn about it still. As of today, I have had the phone for 2 months."
B0791VS3N9,RobertB,3,"I got the phone a year ago to use on the road, and while I was happy with it for a while, the honeymoon ended and I was stick with a phone that failed some major requirements. The Huawei implantation of Bluetooth headsets made it impossible to use the Google Assistant - it refused to open the mike, and the built in mike couldn't pick up voice over road noise. The WiFi receiver got worse over time, to the point where I had to reboot if I wanted WiFi to function. That's a problem when you live on the road, connecting to several truck stops and motels a day. Dual SIM was useless, since the second SIM only supports 2G, which is no longer available for some carriers. The camera is subpar, and the speakerphone is unusable even in a quiet room. I finally bought a Moto 6, and relegated this phone to my backup line. That will allow me to benefit from its one outstanding feature, its long life battery."
B0791VS3N9,MUKESH N.,5,"Excellent budget phone. Practically fulfilling the needs on latest aps, camera, battery, performance, storage, ram etc. Nothing more to expect for $200. Thanks Amazon for bringing this product as many other shops don't sell Huawei phones."
B0791VS3N9,Draxsacans,5,"Great phone, I got it to replace my Huawei honor 5x that I had for a few years. This phone is really snappy, and sleek looking too. It kinda looks like an iPhone 7, which is nice because I always liked their design but never wanted to spend the money on one, so this was the perfect choice for me. The storage space is amazing, on my 5x I couldn't even update my apps anymore for lack of space. Now I have all my apps and still have 46gb left, not to mention the SD card slot for extra space. I only wish they had it in blue like the 7x. It was a tough choice between the two for me because the 7x has the awesome blue, as well as the facial recognition. But the mate se has double the storage and an extra gb of RAM for $30 more. Not to mention the se is also getting an update for facial recognition. I did get a blue slim case so I can pretend my phone is blue. FYI the tudia tamm case is very nice, it keeps the phone slim without extra bulk, but also makes it feel protected. The tempered glass for this phone are awful, none of them seem to stick because of the curved edge on the screen. I did purchase the super shields tempered glass, since they have the best rating with a whopping 3 1/2 stars, but fingers crossed it doesn't pop off."
B0791VS3N9,Jim Root,5,"I love this phone twenty times more than I expected to. I would actually go so far as to say that it's the best phone I've ever owned. The build quality is impressive and it feels very solid. The pictures it takes are incredible for what it is; I frequently have people ask me what camera I took my pictures with and they are always surprised when I tell them my phone. The display is bright, clear, and crisp. There is absolutely nothing I don't love about it; would purchase again in a heartbeat! You could pay three times the cost and still not have a better phone in my opinion. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
B0791VS3N9,phoenix,4,"This is a very good phone. I doubt you can find a better one for less than $300. Build quality is at flagship phone level. The screen is beautiful. Fingerprint scanner and facial recognition are very fast, so is the camera. And the battery lasts quite long. Overall the phone is very quick. I do have some minor software issues with the Outlook and Yahoo Mail apps. Specifically, I am not able to select the notification ringtone for these apps. I don't believe the issue is with the apps because I have another Android phone which doesn't have the problem. I could (probably should) give the phone a 5-star considering the quality, performance, and cost, but decided to give it a 4 for now.

I do wish the phone is little bit smaller. The phone is sort of too big to fit into jean pockets comfortably. No manufacturer seems to be making small form factor phones anymore."
B0791VS3N9,Blocknlot,5,"First let me say that I have been using cell phones for the last 2.5 decades and have watched them progress to where they are today.
Over the years, out of a the blue companies (we all know who they are) starting producing phones at MUCH higher price levels and the public bought them which generated MASSIVE profits for those companies.. After all they are selling you phones that cost less then $150 to make for $700 + dollars to you.
I have never been one of those people, I always looked for value however I have A LOT of experience with expensive Apple and Android phones as besides my personal phone (and those in my family) my workplace supplied me with those expensive phones. Quite honestly, except for trying to ""show off"" I never really liked them.

Anyway it allows me to make direct comparisons to our less expensive personal phones and I never knew what the big deal was by owning the expensive ones, except to brag to friends about the most expensive phones someone bought.. To me that is a waste of money and I always knew those people who had those expensive phones never really ""bought"" them and only had them because they made monthly payments, anyone can do that.

Ok on tho the Huawei, our family has 3 cheaper versions on ATT service called the Elate, beautiful phone, cost us $70 each.
I was so impressed with them, I started to look into other offerings from Huawei and read up on the Huawei Mate SE.
I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Huawei phones review at ALL price levels. So I decided to buy myself the a New Huawei Mate SE as a sort of after Christmas present from my wife.

All I can say is WOW, this phone is AMAZING. Fit, finish, construction, beautiful refined feeling that you get with high end phones, yet this one is only around $200. NOT $1000 dollars.
It does everything any phone costing 4 times its price can do and do it with really good battery life.
Now lets get real, of course if your some super gamer/power user who needs a super high speed processor for some reason of course you will want the latest greatest processor at MUCH higher cost and much higher profit for the phone company.
For the average to above average American, they would never notice a difference, same with he camera, great camera, better then expected, is it as good as a $1000 phone? I can not answer that because when I take REALLY serious photos I use a Nikon digital SLR camera. I can tell you, Im not sure which is better, the camera in my work Iphone or this phone, so that is saying a lot.

Anyway, if you are someone who is considering this phone, I can honestly tell you, you cant go wrong. Just do it, I cant see how ANYONE can be disappointed and I see my wife now, holding it in her hand and it wont be long until she retires her other Huawei for another Mate SE. :o)"
B0791VS3N9,Mckiito,5,"I should have bought this long ago if I knew. This phone is so good that I had to buy one for my phone after I used mine for just a month.
I used to have network issue in my house with my HTC MORE but I have full signal in the same house and on the same career on this phone.

Internet, Bluetooth and everything is great.
Voice mail and everything is working.
NOTE: phone doesn't have infrared so you can't install remote on it but you can do that through the internet. You will need an adapter."
B0791VS3N9,Amy Touassi,5,"For a $250 phone I can't complain at all!!! More storage , ram, and reliability than my Iphone 6 I was using at a fraction of the cost. Took this to Europe for a trip with a seigen case and a wrist grip.com strap and it was great for monument photos and hard to be snatched by passerbys! I've attached a few excellent photos I took with it. Love this phone!"
B0791VS3N9,geogat,5,"WOW! I took a very long time to research various phones to see what I could get that was within my budget, had really good specs, and was at least close to one thing I REALLY wanted, which was a 6"" phone. This one is 5.93"" The specs are fantastic. It works perfectly, and the customer service that Huawei provides is second to none. Very speedy, no delay in anything I've done. Takes nice pictures (I was not looking for ""the best"" pictures - I just wanted something that produced good ones). I really can't say enough good things about it. I'll be looking at Huawei first the next time I need a phone."
B0791VS3N9,Thomas Paine,5,"Recently, my wife decided to drown her Samsung Galaxy 5 and this phone was purchased, by me, as a replacement. She has had it almost 3 weeks now and does not have any negatives to say about it. In fact, all she says is, ""I love it!"" She runs a lot of apps so her first love is its battery which she now can get by with a daily charge. Second, she loves the camera. Third, is the screen resolution and size and finally, it the ease of operation with the Android OS. She was a bit concerned that the phone's physical size might be excessive but now she adores it. Oh, she also said that the phone only has 2 buttons, volume and on/off and both buttons actually required a good push to make contact unlike the Samsung which, annoyingly, needing nothing more than a mere breath. The more she continues to heap praise on this phone, the more I am considering buying one for myself come Christmas. All-in-all, great phone, great price!"
B0791VS3N9,HeavyHarrison,5,"I'm glad I checked the reviews on this Huawei Mate SE. This phone is fast, has beautiful graphics, easy to set up, well made and is the OS is updatable to 8.0. The Moto phones that have an Amazon OS variant have not got an upgrade to the latest OS. I love my Huawei! This phone is well worth the purchase. It doesn't have the Amazon bloatware either....nice! This phone also has a much more stable and lasting internet connection than my Moto G5 Plus. I've been able to use my Huawei Mate SE in the weak signal spots in my home...better than the Moto G5 Plus."
B0791VS3N9,The infamous El Guapo. AKA Paul,4,"Well I just got the phone yesterday 12/14 I didn't set it up until today 12/15. I inserted my sim card the phone needed to ""format sim"" and now my sim card doesn't work on the new phone or my old phone. So for tonight I have no phone. Needless to say I am not at all happy with my purchase. I am strongly considering returning this phone.

***Update I am not as smart as I thought I was**"" I tried to enter the scan disk memory card instead of the nano SIM card. The phone is working now. I still think the phone feels like cheap plastic, but I need some time to see what I really think. Will review again in a couple weeks."
B0791VS3N9,kyle burdick,4,"Nice specs, phone was easy to set up and seems nice and fast out of the box. The build quality is high, and the phone feels more expensive than it's price. Battery was at around 80% when it arrived, and seems to hold it's charge well compared to my old Samsung. Minor complaints, the screen dims when looking at it more than maybe 15 degrees off center vertically. Horizontal brightness seems better, but not perfect. This is common on cheaper phones and not a huge deal, overall the screen is nice looking and feels good. Good touch response. The speaker sound as well as the sound output through the headphone jack is not as good as other phones I've had, but is more than acceptable for what I'll use it for. We'll see how it holds up, but first impression of this phone is pretty good."
B0791VS3N9,Jonathan,4,"I've been using this phone for around 6 months and it's easily the best phone I've had.

Build Quality-
The build of the phone is solid and has some weight to it. Granted I have a case on it, I've dropped it a couple times and not a mark on it. The touch sensor located in the upper middle on the backside is a good location and easy to reach, works very well.

Screen-
While not a 4k screen, it's full HD and looks incredibly sharp. The colors look very sharp, and you're able to change the color temp in the settings which is a nice touch.

Speakers-
While only one on the bottom right side, they're fairly loud and sound pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but they get the job done.

Cameras-
This is where the sacrifices were surely made. In low light, the camera quality is pretty bad. In normal lighting they're OK, so if you're keen on photography you'd be better off looking elsewhere.

Battery -
This is a huge thing for me since I'm a heavy user. I'm always streaming music, watching videos or surfing the web. The battery easily lasts me the day, 12-15 hours, with 40% left to boot. In the off chance you need it, there's the standard battery saver, and the very handy ultra power saving mode at 10% that puts up a black screen with only the bare necessity apps for communication.

Performance-
This phone is no slouch, it's incredibly fast for the regular tasks. It can multitask very well without any hiccups. As for gaming, I'm not too keen on mobile gaming but I imagine this can handle most apps you throw at it. For a visual spectacle this might not be an ideal phone for you, but that's up to testing.

I'm very happy with my purchase!"
B0791VS3N9,Lisa Hart-White,5,"If you know the size of an iPhone 6 plus it is the same size and actually looks like one. It has been a great phone. The case it comes with isn't the greatest, but overall for $250... You can't beat this phone. I had an LG G4 prior to this phone. Oh and it constantly updates it's software which makes me super happy. I chose this over the new LG G7 thinQ. Very happy with it"
B0791VS3N9,Limitless,5,"I have been buying the newest flagship phones for about 8 years now. I got tired of the high cost of contracts and the high cost of having the newest phone. I wanted to go to prepaid and started looking for good phones that weren't pushing $1000. Pretty quickly Huawei popped up and in particular the Mate SE. I went from the Note 4 to the iPhone 7 plus to this. Wow! This phone is an amazing deal. I have always leaned towards Android and having this phone has definitely reinforced that. I bought a couple of other prepaid phones before this phone.....there is no comparison. The Mate SE is an AMAZING phone at this price. This brand name was a little foreign to me until I started some research on the best phones for the price. Great screen size, great picture, great power, great battery life and very good camera. I will be looking to Huawei and it's sub brand Honor for my next phones. This phone could easily cost 2-3 times what it does and still be a great phone. That alone speaks volumes. I always loved having the newest and greatest phones.....this phone is so close to flagship and the price is 1/4 of a flagship phone. Highly Recommended!"
B0791VS3N9,jedijood,5,"This phone grabs my attention for three things:

1) The RAM size. You will not experience lag between applications. This is hands down the best RAM available for this price point. This alone will make the purchase worth it.

2) The durability. I am a careless user. I dont believe in taking care of your phone. If you pay this much you should be able to live free from worry. I have dropped this phone so many times on the concrete and the screen has not shattered and the case that it comes with has held this up. I am surprised this phone takes a beating and still looks relatively new.

3) The size. I have small hands and this phone does not feel huge or hard to hold. The Mate Pro was too large of a form factor and this one fits perfect."
B0791VS3N9,Chis Wiz,5,"This phone is a vast improvement over the more expensive LG phone I had before. I had been cussing my service provider for no service in certain areas on the old phone, but now there is service where those cuss words hung in the air. I don't use the camera very much, but I have taken a couple of really good pictures with it, one portrait and one landscape. Physically the phone is very solid, and survived a couple of drops with the included case, and a purchased screen protector. It has a large bright screen, and does not come loaded with crapware, although Google manages to sneak some in. Note that this is a GSM phone, only valid for ATT and T-Mobile in the US, and in all the rest of the world. I managed, with very little help from my service provider, to make the transition from my old phone."
B0791VS3N9,Duane A. Frybarger,5,"Coming from a Nexus 5 which had started to give me problems, this is an amazing upgrade. The smoothest move I've ever had on a smart phone using Huawei's app to bring every thing over from my Nexus. Even configuring my provider (Ting) was amazingly simple (that had always been the hardest part of switching phones for me). The phone is gorgeous, quick, great battery life, no complaints so far. I was expecting some kind of problem but encountered none that couldn't be resolved. Highly recommended!"
B0791VS3N9,David G,5,"I have used Samsung Galaxy's since the first one. This phone blows away Samsung. It is hands down a better phone. Battery life, user interface, picture quality, speed, no bloatware! This is the first review I have ever written for a phone, probably my second review ever on Amazon in 10 years. Buy this phone if you're looking at the Galaxy's."
B0791VS3N9,Evergreen Boy,5,"I've had the phone for two months and purchased it prior to a European tour. The Dual SIM feature was good. I got a Vodafone SIM for $30 in London and I had phone and data in the five countries we visited. I took a camera, but the phone took great pictures and video. Should have left the camera at home. Battery life is long. I'm not a heavy user and, in the evening, after being in and out of my pocket all day, I still have about 85% battery. When traveling and getting directions and taking lots of pics it got down to the 20's and 30's a couple of times. There was a problem with Bluetooth slowing Wifi down to a crawl when I first bought it but it upgraded to Oreo and that problem was resolved. The fingerprint reader works well except for when my hands are wet and I have to wait for them to dry before I can use the phone. I have no regrets."
B0791VS3N9,AmazonCustomer,4,"Pros:
- Inexpensive
- Free silicone case
- Headphone jack
- Fingerprint scanner
- Dual Sim capability
- Aluminum body
- 4GB of RAM
- 64GB of internal storage
- Support Micro SD up to 256GB
- Excellent battery life
- Hardly overheat
- Acceptable performance/camera quality

Cons:
- No 5GHZ (802.11ac) WIFI
- Outdated Bluetooth 4.1 standard
- Micro USB
- No NFC

- CAT 4 LTE with no carrier aggregation support
- Doesn't support T-Mobile LTE band 66/71
- No OIS/EIS
- OEM bloatware

Overall the Mate SE offers a ton of great things at an affordable price, it does come with compromises that can't be overlooked. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for."
B0791VS3N9,Hard knocks,5,Everything about this phone is great. Iput it on par with Samsung 8 and iPhone 8. My last phone was iPhone 6 but due to Apple programing I was very unhappy with it. I got this phone because I perfer Android over iso and was surprised at the quality.
B0791VS3N9,Cuprous,5,"Very happy with this phone. The only con is that the camera isn't super great but at $230 I'm not going to knock a star for that. Otherwise it runs very smooth, no lag with apps, everything is nice and responsive. Battery life so far has been great, I'm easily getting a full day+ with moderate usage.

Be sure to run the system update when you get it so you get the latest android version."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I was looking for a smartphone that if I dropped in the toilet I wouldn't be too upset over, but I wanted large size because I am a large man. So I wasn't going to pay for an iPhone or Samsung, and didn't want to spend more than a few hundred dollars. I have been a customer of TracFone for years, and I knew they have a Bring Your Own Phone program. I saw this phone at Walmart under an AT&T subscription. So I did a little research and figured out that buying a factory unlocked phone and a TracFone AT&T SIM card would suit my needs. I purchased both from Amazon, and went about the set up when they arrived. As soon as I turned the phone on, it began auto updating it's software and apps. This took the better part of 20 hours! They only real issue I had was that altho I used Tracfone's website to activate the SIM, it didn't happen. After 3 days of no service, I went to the TracFone's website and used the Chat feature with an associate. The SIM activated and the number ported in about a half hour. BINGO and Win Win!

Since I began using this phone in late July, twice I have gotten automated calls from AT&T to verify the account. First it asks for the last four of my social security number, which I typed in. Then it asked for my AT&T account number. At this point I did not enter any number. After asking twice more, the computer gave up and said Thank You! I never lost service.
As to the phone it is really very good! Altho like all Android phones I've had it doesn't allow you to completely delete unwanted apps, or move them to the SD card memory, it does have the ability to stop updating the apps you don't want and thus save the phone's memory.
The SD micro card and the SIM both live in a pop-out tray. If you travel internationally, this feature theoretically allows you to obtain a SIM card in the place you are visiting pop it into your phone and you are ready to go.
Other reviews have panned the camera quality in low light on this phone. I can't say I've done enough pics on it to notice, but I was buying a phone, not a camera.
All in all I heavily recommend this phone and the TracFone system to anyone looking to purchase a larger smartphone for 25% of what an iPhone or Samsung costs."
B0791VS3N9,Shensong,5,"I bought another 6"" phone about 2 years ago, but for some reason I just didn't like it. Decided to buy this one; it's just slightly smaller (I mean maybe 1/16"" in each dimension), and it's much lighter than the other. I have small hands to begin with, and arthritis in my hands and shoulders, and didn't realize that was what was putting me off about the first phone; the weight difference irritated me just enough to make it uncomfortable. All that aside, the phone has a stunning 2560px display (as good as Iphone), works beautifully, is quick as a hiccup, and the fingerprint id works on the first shot every time. The cameras do a lovely job. I got the Orzero case which fit beautifully and looks great. For the price, you can't beat this phone!"
B0791VS3N9,micah justin palmer,5,After a few days of owning the phone I have to say it is one of the best phones I've ever purchased. The only flaw I've noticed so far is the bluetooth connected issue with wifi. While I am using my bluetooth headset the rate at which it downloads data dramatically decreases. Other than that I am veeerryyy happy with the phone so far. The battery last like 2 days its amazing.
B0791VS3N9,TE5LA,3,"I'm a mobile electronics installer and one of the big things today is using your mobile to play music in your vehicle, which Android Auto compatible radios are designed to do. Sadly, Huawei phones do not work with Car Play. I think there should be a big notice in the description NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANDROID CAR PLAY.

Huawei needs to stop being lazy and fix this. I would not have purchased this phone had I known this. Otherwise, I'd have given it 5 stars."
B0791VS3N9,Ed Lockhart,5,"I could not tell much difference between this phone and my iPhone7Plus. It is fast, screen/picture quality outstanding, and the best part is that it has dual sim/memory slot. This is super convenient for international travelers. Works perfectly in Asia and Europe. Switching between the sims is seamless. You can also boost the memory big time with your own microSD card.

Cons: the face recognition is a slightly slower than finger print.

This phone is worth every single penny you pay."
B0791VS3N9,Lynda,5,"The 1st phone had a software glitch. Screen would not stay on. No adjustment possible. Huawei offered to fix it no charge, Amazonâs superior customer service replaced it, and I sent the other one back. Itâs a great phone. Good quality, and fast. The sound it good quality, better than most, approaching Iphone quality, (and 1/3 the price), and the pictures look good to me. The apps from Huawei are also useful and good quality. So far, after getting one that works correctly, Iâm very happy with the phone, Amazonâs service, and the Huawei Company. I recommend buying this phone through Amazon."
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,1,"So, after 3 months the screen became detached from the left hand side of the phone. There's a slight gap where you can see inside the phone. Note, the screen is not cracked or smashed in any way.

It looks like I have to work this out through Huawei and the process has been solw so far. I do not have much hope at this point that I'll ever get a phone that works. Currently, it's taken 3 days to process my claim and I'm still waiting for instructions on how I can send in the phone.

I bought my wife the same phone a couple of months ago and it looks like my kids need replacement phones as well. I will be looking at some other alternatives."
B0791VS3N9,Tom,5,Awesome smart phone! Upgraded from the Honor 5x and the difference is significant and noticable. Considered the 7x but the Mate SE provided the extra RAM. Glad I made the switch and I would highly recommend!
B0791VS3N9,PJ,1,"Phone worked fine for a few months despite not getting notifications consistently. I'd receive notifications intermittently. The GPS is HORRIBLE. It takes about a minute to find my current location. That's a crucial 60 secs when being out of town. Next issue is the caller ID. It no longer works. I've done troubleshooting with my carrier and it's not their issue. I've downloaded a 3rd app which works, but the CALLER ID on the phone will not. Customer service has been useless. You win some and you lose some. This was a loss."
B0791VS3N9,Wendy Sieber,5,"Bought this for our daughter who broke her iPhone but not eligible for an upgrade and no insurance. Still have to pay on a broken phone, but daughter needed one. She actually likes this one better than her iphone!! Less glitchy, and she's always liked the Android apps better. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and for the price, you can't beat it! Husband and I are seriously considering Huawei phones purchased outright instead of Samsung and monthly payments!"
B0791VS3N9,Paul M,5,"I've had this phone for about 5 months now and don't have a single complaint. Like others, I was skeptical at first. I've always had Samsung Galaxy phones and my current one needed upgrading, but didn't want to spend another $900 for a s9 plus.

I came across this one based on something I read on cnet and decided to give it a shot. It's completely lived up to expectations and more. Everything I do on a Samsung phone can be done on this one to the same level. It's fast, never freezes, streams videos with ease, and the sound quality is good. Battery life is great. It lasts forever. Picture quality is fine, but not as good as you'd get from a Samsung or iPhone. I don't take many pictures so I really don't care about having the best quality pictures, but it's more than adequate for me.

In short, if you're on the fence about this phone, don't be. Get it. I'll never high prices for a Samsung again when phones like this are available."
B0791VS3N9,Patrick Laxson,5,"This phone is absolutely awesome. I have had a couple of galaxies in the past, the most recent being the S7 Edge, and I had more hang ups and problems with the Galaxies. The phone looks and feels really nice, the screen is beautiful, and the fingerprint scanner is great. The photo quality seems fine to me and the camera app opens very quickly so you don't miss any good shots. I have only two complaints: it has good specs and plenty of memory, but you can't install Fortnite on it, and it has the 18:9 screen ratio, so 16:9 videos have space on either size, but this is just my preference."
B0791VS3N9,Rachel,5,"OMG! I will never spend $1000 on a phone again. My carrier is MetroPCs, which uses T-Mobile bands. I have no issues with LTE or phone signal whatsoever. I did make a mistake when switching SIM cards though. When I received it, I switched SIM card and it didn't work. I thought it was the phone not compatible with my carrier, but it turns out I had to call the Carrier and they will have to reactivate the SIM card using the new phone's unique ID. That took 2 minutes over phone and it was done absolutely free. Ever since then, no issues at all. So please call your carrier to inquire about the SIM card transferring to the new phone. Phone runs super fast and has the exact same internal storage amount (64GB) as my old iphone 6s that has been giving me issues charging for months. Not to mention, I can buy a SD card to extend the storage to $256GB!!! This phone has very long hours of battery and fast operation. Takes decent pictures as well. I can't believe it took me so long to switch! The only thing is that the selfie camera is not as good as my iphone, which is ok with me, since I barely take any selfies anyway."
B0791VS3N9,Lawrence W. Stephens,5,"I needed a smart phone in the mid budget range. Most are cheap with the next step up at the high range. Iâm needing only a good camera. To my surprise, daylight scenic photos match my Nikon P510. Low light photos are average. Telephoto shots are not too bad. For the price, it does near everything the $660 -$800 cell phones do. It is perfect for the average user. Sound fair but I use ear phones anyhow. Phone clarity is good. Heavy users might want to spend more to get better sound, and a Gorilla glass display with is lacking. If you depend on your phone to take wedding picture quality, this one is iffy. Youâll need to spend twice to get any better. BTY it looks just as good as the more expensive ones."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I went to downtown yesterday. My son used my phone playing games online for one hour on the way. Then I used my phone google map as my GPS for one hour. My son played games during lunch time and break time. I took some photos at night. Then it was still 50% power left when we got on the train. My son watched videos for a hour on the train. It was 40% power left when we arrived home. Cool! It is in winter. My previous Samsung phone never had such long standby time. Moreover, charging battery is super fast. I am very happy with it. However, about taking pictures, the phone has an automatic beautification function. Although I turned off the beautification function, but in the pic the human skin is still too smooth, and even my lunch is beautified. This, I don't really like it."
B0791VS3N9,Pdd206,5,"I will update this review in a few weeks if necessary but so far I am absolutely happy with this phone. I had to get a new sim card bc my previous phone carried a different size. I went to my current carrier MetroPCS and dropped $15 for the card and they tested that the phone worked which all took about 5-7 minutes.

The phone takes great low light pictures. I understand that the latest model is amazing but this was what my budget could afford now. Google Playstore is accessible and I haven't had any issues with any of my previous used apps.

I crossed my fingers on this purchase. I am so far very glad on the outcome."
B0791VS3N9,Ray Mac,5,This phone is absolutely a great choice. They call this a budget cellphone? The Huawei Mate SE is solid and well made. It's made better than most expensive cellphones. The screen is crystal clear and vibrant. The bluetooth and call quality is excellent on AT&T's network. So many great features to name on here. I rate it an A+ in my opinion. My only con is the battery probably won't last you all day if you're a heavy user like myself. Charging the Huawei Mate SE is pretty quick though. The Huawei Mate SE is another winner at a reasonable price!
B0791VS3N9,Susan K.,5,"Very happy with this Huawei Mate SE purchase! The overall quality is excellent especially for a $200 phone.
The main feature I value is the 4GB of Ram. Apps run well, internet pages load quickly, app update installs are quick, etc. The local storage allows many multiple apps to be installed along with videos, music, etc, Additionally I use Nova Launcher instead of the native one and there is no lag whatsoever.

Other features I like include:
- Being able to access the SD card without opening case
- There is a 3mm headphone jack
- The fingerprint reader is lightening fast
- The screen size is large enough to comfortably watch videos while not making the phone so large so it is unwieldy
- Screen resolution, camera quality, sound quality are all great especially at this price.

This phone exceeded my expectations. Plus it looks sleek especially in the gold color. The Huawei Mate SE has the same external design as the Huawei Honor 7x model which was a wide selling phone. This means that many accessories designed to work with the Honor 7x will also work with the Mate SE.

I've had the Huawei Mate SE for about three months and highly recommend it if you're looking for a $200 - $250 cell phone with excellent quality and great selection of features."
B0791VS3N9,2raine,5,"I've had this phone for just under 3 months. After only having flagships (iPhone, Samsung & LG), I am very happy with this phone.

The only thing I am unhappy about is no NFC. But for the $224 I paid, I can't really complain. Also, I knew going in the camera was not flagship quality. I don't really use it that often, so I am ok with that. This might be a concern for others.

I find it to be a fast and responsive phone. The battery life is great. The screen is fine. Battery life is excellent. I can leave it unplugged over night at 100% and it's going to be at 98% when I wake up 7 hours later.

I'm with T-Mobile and it works well with their signal. Voice calls have been 100% relaible. It should be noted, I live in a large city

I've had the Huawei mediapad m3 for one year and now the Mate SE. I plan on getting a Huawei flagship for my next phone. I can't say enough about my user experience with Huawei products. I figure I will get a Huawei flagship one iteration behind for $300 and I know I'll be very happy."
B0791VS3N9,Jake,5,"Having been an iphone user for the past 10 years, I have to say this is easily the best phone I've ever owned. The display is simply stunning, the battery lasts forever, apps run very fast and smooth. The battery lasts days on a single charge.
I especially love the selfie cam, it performs amazingly well in low light environments. My understanding is that when you take a selfie with it, it actually takes a bunch of pics behind the scene and use AI to select the one that looks best. I know it's weird but I always get the most natural facial expression when I take pics with this phone.
Overall, I think this phone feels even more premium than iPhone X. The only thing that bothers me a little is the lack of apple's iMessage. But if you are an android fan, this is a very solid choice."
B0791VS3N9,Stephanie A.,4,"Great phone for a great price.
-Beautiful, vivid screen, great for viewing videos and games
-Sleek, attractive design, easy to operate with one hand
-Responsive finger print unlock is super convenient and time saving
-Lots of space left even after built-in apps (about 48gb free out of 64gb)
-Screen flash means low light selfies are better than my previous phones
-Front facing camera takes good quality photos
-Battery lasts ALL day with consistent use on WiFi
-Comes with clear, jelly case which does a fair job of protecting the phone without obscuring its beautiful design (wouldn't count on it to protect against drops, however)

One weakness:
-Built in speakers are not great quality: a bit hollow, tinny sounding and not super loud (although usually use my headphones or bluetooth speakers, so this does not bother me)

Would definitely recommend to a friend."
B0791VS3N9,Miles,5,I ordered this phone because of the price it featured the components I liked . Behold the feel weight and form felt right to me much higher quality than expected . screen viewing is average build is excellent . nothing out of the ordinary just feels like a quality product.i was overcome with a feeling of lucky pride to have this phone in my possession.i set up the accounts this was above the price category it was smooth responsive and fast. Not the fastest I encountered but fast as I could go great pace and fluidity.its been a few days since I have first ran it.no flaw's of any kind.it had I believe in house computer processers . excuse my lingo. I like company's that stand by there crations this brand seemed to houner that stand.verry nice I will have to get some of the other phones and products in the future .I truly appreciate this phone because it is original in it's presentation.it has instructions on the back kudos to the design engineer and company for taking an out of the box idea and creatiand marketing this phone.i love it it is among my most recap need at this price range.love and peace out miles
B0791VS3N9,Kelly B.,5,"Replaced my nearly 3 year old LG G4 with this phone. Didn't want to pay flagship prices for a phone I am only going to own for another 3 years. Saw the reviews on this phone and decided ""why not?"" Have had this phone for 2 months now and not regretting the decision at all! Am new to the brand and it's very easy to learn (it is Android-based). Removed some of the pre-installed software that came with the phone that I wasn't going to use. I've taken some really good pics with this phone, without having to play around with the advanced settings. The phone is fast while navigating different apps as well! I'm heavy on Facebook, Yahoo Finance, YouTube, Mail, and Google. Sound using the phone speakers could be better. The volume seems a bit low. However, when connected to a headset or Bluetooth device, is quite good. The best part of this phone, you ask? The BATTERY LIFE!! I only need to charge this phone every 2 DAYS! Hopefully the battery life stays like that for a while. So I am pretty happy with this phone. Glad I purchased! :-)"
B0791VS3N9,KaileyK,5,"After months of researching a new phone I finally decided on this one. It has met all of my needs and beyond. Quality is top notch, screen is beautiful, plenty of storage space, smooth OS and the camera is spectacular(added some pics to review). I'm extremely happy with this purchase!

Only issue is you cannot play audio externally via an auxiliary cable. I purchased a Bluetooth adapter for my car though and that solved the problem."
B0791VS3N9,Pae,4,"After almost 3 months of use, I will say I am somehow satisfied with this phone. My biggest problem is the speaker, it's so low, many time I have had to switch speaker off because it's either too low, poor sound quality. Another problem I am beginning to face is the battery life. I am not a heavy user but little games like free cell or buble mania will run the battery down so fast! Takes nice pictures better than my old phone, I am still to experience glitches, crashes! I know it's still early for me to give a full review on everything, still learning things about it! Overall, it does what a phone is supposed to for now! Fingers crossed. Thank you."
B0791VS3N9,Pradeep,3,The phone was really good but had one issue. The touch screen was very laggy. I am not sure if it was only an issue with the one I received because I did not see this in the reviews but the lag was bad enough for me to return it the same day. I would have loved to keep it for the configuration and the features.
B0791VS3N9,Finton Lubrin,5,"I owned the honor 7 before this phone and it was really impressive however I had to give it to my brother as he was leaving for school ( he too was and is still impressed). I decided to upgrade to the 64 gb 4 GB ram mate se and I have never regretted it. This phone has the feeland performance of a much more expensive handset ,my only gripe is that the sound is a bit low but the headphone jack makes up for that I would easily buy this phone again and again without hesitation"
B0791VS3N9,Ivan,4,"The screen is great, good viewing angles, and despite not being in the 'right' aspect ratio for watching 16:9 videos it has above average clarity. Battery lasts for more than a day on a single charge, which is really important for me as I travel long distances and can't afford much downtime.
Camera is alright, quality is definitely in the ballpark of other dual-camera configs. Front camera is meh, good enough for Snapchat but don't expect much.
Finger print sensor is snappy and quick.
WLAN connectivity is eh. You don't get AC wifi on this so you won't be able to utilize the full potential of your wifi if it's faster than 30mbps. Doesn't matter because I don't need that much bandwidth.
The only complaint I have is that EMUI is complete garbage. Installed a third party launcher within 5 minutes of using it. Largest complaint is that it doesn't show the number of notifications I have on the icons, instead it just shows a single red dot and expect me to click on it and check it myself. Comes with minimal amount of bloatware that can be manually removed.
Rubbish speakers, but I don't go anywhere without my bluetooth stereo so they don't matter to me.

For the budget you are actually getting a very good deal. Yeah some compromises here and there but $200 is $200."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"I've had this phone for one week so far. It arrived with a hairline crack, but I had to use it as my other phone was not functioning. I've ordered a replacement so hopefully it goes well with return. My review is based on the phones performance, not this crack. AT&T. It works perfectly. The camera is excellent in good lighting. Low light it lacks but for the price I certainly can't complain. The fingerprint sensor is lightning fast. It's fast. Has plenty of storage, which is expandable with the SD card. Buy this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Obaapa Abena,5,"This phone is amazing I love it,the battery life is really good been using it for 4 days now . Awesome ððððð"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I am usually a Samsung shoper, I decided to make the switch because I was tired of the high phone payments and the plan payments. So when time came to buy a new phone, I decided to buy a budget phone, I was expecting a downgrade but I so no difference quite the opposite, this was better than the expensive samsungs. The battery life is great, I didn't have to charge it everynight, unless I play video games with it :) ... The useability is awesome very slick and fast processor and the price is where I need it to be. My wife says that pic quality is much better on Samsung but for that price I am fine with this."
B0791VS3N9,Ben Main,2,"*updated to reflect over 7 months of usage*

Pros:
-large storage
-large screen with great image (until con- screen burn chances!)
-long battery life
-many camera options (*does not mean great results)
-Dual Sim (I don't use but for those who do...)

Cons:
-screenburn after about 8 months
-bloatware
-no 5g Wi-Fi connectivity (other budget phones have this so I think it's a fair comparison)
-sound (tiny speaker--alarms can be a challenge to hear!)
-Bluetooth (constant interruptions and need to reconnect after extended periods of time)
-incompatible with Android Auto
-many apps require you to perform special go arounds for them to work (pill reminder, TrueCaller to name a few)
-camera software takes awkward selfies (weird proportions, unclear)
-no fast charge abilities

Summary:
I purchased this to replace my Moto. I was most hoping for at least a similar experience however while there are some great aspects (screen, battery life) I found there to be many things surprisingly lacking.

But first let me start with the good so this review isn't all gloom! The battery life is amazing, and I do love the screen size and quality. Transferring files was an easy, though long, process (took about 4 hours despite the 2 hour estimated time) to help make my phone switch rather seemless. The phone is responsive and I'm enjoying the large memory--both ROM and RAM.

*note that this phone uses Nano Sim cards so you will possibly need to change your Sim card out if use another size*

Within the first day I was disappointed at the amount of bloatware. Besides some huawei apps you can't remove there are also some Android apps you are stuck with (Gmail being an example). I also found the speaker quality to be highly disappointing. Being on the bottom edge of the phone the sound is rather quiet and doesn't sound as clear as other phones.

Within the first week the disappointments continued. The selfie camera is not really useful--most always blurry and at times the aspect ratio would leave photos distorted. No 5G WiFi I can live with, but I miss having the option to connect to another network. Certain apps are incompatible with Huawei devices and others require you to go in to your settings and follow a series of steps just to get important notifications to work (specifically my pill reminder app, Medisafe, cannot remind me of pills automatically; TrueCaller cannot scan phone calls actively without special changes to settings). Also I have found the alarm app to be unreliable due to the poor, low speaker quality I've have missed several of the-something I have not had a problem with when using other devices.

And within a month of use I was also bummed to find that Android Auto does not work with this-or most all Huawei - phone. Using Bluetooth I had to become used to songs cutting out sporadically for a few seconds and after about 40+ minutes of use the signal would stop completely requiring a reset of Bluetooth on the device.

After 7 months Bluetooth continues to be a disappointment with increases in not connecting to other devices (especially car). Then I was surprised to find it get screen burn- I didn't realize that was still a thing but apparently so. Tried several apps that were to help. Didn't seem to quite work, perhaps over time it'll get better--but the way things are going with this phone it'll probably get worse.

Overall while at first the price point was attractive, as more aspects disappointed me I have come to realize this switch was not a very good one. Can I live with it? I can, and need to, but with other budget phones having many of these features I think this will be the first, and last, huawei phone I purchase. There are definitely better options in this price range out there if you're someone who uses a phone beyond battery life and general practical use."
B0791VS3N9,Pete-NJ,4,"I just got the phone for barely over 24 hours but so far I am impressed with it. The only features that I wish it had are 1. dual band WiFi, 2. stereo speaker and 3. NFC. None of these are deal breaker for me and I am very happy with the purchase. I will report back if something go wrong after a few months of use.

An interesting thing is when I received the package, it is obvious to me right away that somewhere along the delivery process someone has opened the box and inspect the contents since the phone is all by itself and not in the original white Huawei box. But the phone is in good shape and didn't seem there is any missing parts or accessories. I guess instead of worrying about the Chinese government is spying on my phone, I now may have to worry about FBI/NSA/CIA may have bugged my phone :)"
B0791VS3N9,Peide Xie,5,"A beautiful, very capable Android smartphone for $230, a fraction of flagship phones! Looks nice, performs well, and quick. I have not enabled its phone-use capabilities yet, so can't comment on it until I do. I am currently only using it at home with my WiFi network for surfing and entertainment uses. Great purchase.
8/14/18 Update: I've obtained a prepaid cell phone service provider who uses Verizon's network about 3 weeks ago. The phone is working nicely."
B0791VS3N9,Jason,5,"I got sick of paying for OVERPRICED cell phones. My 6 month search for the best budget phone is now complete. In fact I am blown away by the features this phone has... Huge 6 inch screen, amazing battery life, 8 core CPU, 64 GB storage, 4GB memory, super fast finger print reader, FACE UNLOCK ID, Android 8.0, aluminum construction! Dual SIM card slot, expandable storage, camera is pretty decent. All for only $229 Goodbye Apple and Samsung....

I haven't noticed many issues, sound quality is okay, not paying high price so I didn't expect much. Not waterproof, never owned a waterproof phone so I don't care much about that feature."
B0791VS3N9,Insta@ViceVibez.,5,"Had it for over a month now. It's holding up. No problems yet, or at least no significant problems. I use T-Mobile on this phone and it works, however I'm getting delayed text messages. Not sure if it's from TMobile because I contacted them and they said their nearby towers are all working fine and they reset my service or my connection and I'm still getting this problem from time to time. Not 100% blaming it on the phone yet, this is just something I've noticed."
B0791VS3N9,Ouzter,5,"I purchased this to replace my Note 3. I enjoy it a lot. This phone has many options like turning off mobile data but keeping the regular cell services on; which my Note 3 said it did but it didn't work correctly. The pictures are wonderful and it is well designed. It tells me when apps are using a lot of battery which I like to know. Many apps are not made for such a long screen though so it asks every time I open an app to make it full screen or not (not a pop up, just an option at the bottom of the screen) which is obnoxious."
B0791VS3N9,John C.,5,"Technology is at the point where purchasing a cell phone for $800+ is no longer a necessity if you want a quality device. So many manufacturers are creating devices at budget friendly prices that are quite comparable to the more expensive ones. And, the Huawei device for perfectly into the budget friendly category. Granted, it can't do EVERYTHING the newest device on the market can do, but honestly ask yourself - do you use ALL those features. I, personally, do not, so the Mate SE suits me just fine. It is a great price for such a well made, well functioning phone. I've had it for almost two months now, and I have had no issue whatsoever with it. And, if you care about the version of operating system your phone is running, this phone I'd upgradable to Android 8.0 - Oreo. Seriously recommend this phone if you are budget conscious, and desire good quality."
B0791VS3N9,Ken,5,"Had a Samsung S4 prior to purchasing this phone. It was becoming obsolete, apps would not work on it. After reading all the reviews on many phones, decided on the Huawei Mate SE, so happy with it, fast response, great battery, never runs out. Love all the features. The tip section is great as you don't get much of an instruction manual with it. My husband bought one also after seeing mine."
B0791VS3N9,Everyday S,3,"The phone is fast and has a lot of storage. However, the camera sucks. The pictures are grainy and don't have enough clarity. I'm coming from having a Moto x pure for two yrs which has a 21 mp camera with really decent pictures. Also, the phone doesn't have quick charging. Overall, it's not bad for the price but I feel like I'm taking pictures with a 10 yr old flip phone"
B0791VS3N9,RINXX,4,"This is the one to get. Price is right. Not looking buy the latest flagship phone. I compared my old iPhone 5 to the Blu Vivo recently and It went terribly. See my Vivo review. 2 Gb ram vivo was no competitions in performance to my iPhone 5. 4 Gb ram Huawei Mate did the trick. Itâs fast enough and does everything the flagship phones can do at a quarter of the price. No problems connecting to Bluetooth in my car. Iâm able to move files from my Mate SE to a usb drive with no problems. Big screen, good sound a sturdy build, fast performance, GPS, great camera, and an FM RADIO (a trick iPhones canât do) Iâve found my new âDaily Driverâ."
B0791VS3N9,anthony allard,4,"This phone has massive storage. I recently owned a Samsung 5 and it feels great to be able to put any app I want on it without deleting another. The sound the speaker gives off is loud and clear as well. I had the phone next to my portable speaker and I thought my portable was on and it wasn't. Camera works great as well. Way better than my Samsung 5. Since that was my last phone that's all I can compare it to. Update to Android 8 was very easy because it prompted me to do so, pretty much just a tap away. I would recommend this phone to anyone who hates contracts and wants a lot storage while having a solid camera. Only 2 dislikes for me. 1. The speaker phone itself isn't as loud as my Samsung was even though playing music and watching videos blows it away. 2. I have to hit the back button to remove the keyboard while using messenger. This just means I have to hit back 2x to get out of anything I'm typing. Kind of a plus and minus because sometimes when you want the keyboard to go away on a Samsung 5 its difficult, at least for me."
B0791VS3N9,Matthew,5,"Apparently $200 for a phone has is considered in the lower end price range.
It has a battery that last around 2 days, nice display screen, and good sound. It seems well made and has a lot of great functions."
B0791VS3N9,yuan,5,"This is a beautiful, powerful, amazing smartphone, with similar or better quality than phones of several times of price. Long lasting battery, super performance, great pictures, comfortable design and touch. Phone is cool while playing videos. Setup is so easy. Dual Sim. PERFECT size. Fingerprint unlocking works flawlessly. The only drawback in my opinion is that the battery is built into the phone and may be hard to be exchanged by the consumer. This phone is a great addition to the US phone market for consumers to choose."
B0791VS3N9,R. K,5,"I think its a great deal, a very good phone. No complaints except that it comes with a protective case in its factory box. It should be mentioned and leave the choice to customer to order another one if they like. I did not see a warranty card or booklet in the box i am going to check if it really carries the warranty or not. I don't want to make it an issue So ! thank you ."
B0791VS3N9,Catsam,5,"I bought it for my daughter, and she likes it a lot. This phone is fast, it always gets the strongest wifi signal compared with 4 other phones in my home. Some people complaint about the camera, but I think the pictures took by the phone is pretty good. You even can use Facial ID to unlock the phone. For some reason, used the GPS on Google map didn't work at first, after I restarted the phone a couple of times, it works very well now. Thanks Huawei for making such a nice phone at such a reasonable price. I hope the Honor 8x will be here soon."
B0791VS3N9,R.B,5,"I've been using this phone for the past few weeks and I can't say anything bad about it. Big screen, fast processor, enough RAM and an SD card expansion slot to store plenty of music and video files. The speaker is loud enough and the battery lasts for a long time.
Keep in mind that this is a $230 phone so you will not get all the bells and whistles that other expensive brands have. Personally, I don't care about those extra features because I don't use them anyway. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
B0791VS3N9,Selyts,5,"Absolutely stellar phone for the price!
My last five personal phones were all Samsung Galaxies. After almost purchasing the new Samsung Note ($1000),I decided to give this highly reviewed and affordable phone a shot first.
I am extremely happy that I did as I am absolutely astounded that a phone of this capability and capacity is available at this price.
I installed my favorite launcher (Smart Launcher) and I was all set.
Great speed, great pics, ultra fast fingerprint sensor, and all around fantastic piece of equipment.
Definitely recommend this affordable powerhouse of a phone."
B0791VS3N9,Shawn Boosveld,4,"Its literally an iPhone for a 1/4 the cost. The fingerprint is amazing, three months in the processing is fine, the battery is leagues beyond apple. The sound quality is ok and the volume variability is absolutely abysmal. I use a samsung tablet in my car for spotify instead of my phone. It works ok enough when paired with my powerbeats3 since they can boost the volume too but the loud is too soft and the soft isn't soft enough. Picture quality is good. Literally everything else is good except the sound, but hey saving $600 on an off brand iPhone."
B0791VS3N9,Siobhan Smith,5,"My phone was shattered for a while before it finally died, died and I was forced to buy a new phone. I spent forever reading reviews and trying to decide. This phone has met every expectation and then some. I didn't want to spend $500+ for a phone that would last maybe 2 years. Plus, I don't really care about technology. That being said, I travel a lot and wanted a phone that took good pictures, this one meets that requirement. My boyfriend and I compared pictures on this vs. Samsung S7 and I think mine came out sharper and more vibrant. I'm happy with this phone!"
B0791VS3N9,Dr. Skeen,5,"After using a LG G3 for years, this was a great upgrade, despite it's consideration as a cheap device. For one, the fingerprint sensor, which is fast, is located on the back, similar to the back located button on the G3. Second, it has more RAM and storage with expandable support for up to 256 GB. Only downside is no removable battery. Speaking of the battery it is large and easily lasts all day. Overall, a snappy device that is a steal at the price I paid."
B0791VS3N9,al adi,4,"Seems to be running faster and better than Nuu G3. I like small,4 inch phones which are probably no longer available. Even thou it says 18:9 aspect ratio, they must mean the viewing screen and not what is actually in your hand. Nuu G3 is smaller width wise. Mate SE has pretty much the same width compared to HTC Desire eye from 2 years ago. The glass is curved on the side much like Galaxy S9. So a glass screen protector could have problems with the sides. Original clear silicone case that came with phone protects the glass screen when you place it glass down on a surface. Doesn't have a color reverse, which turns white into black when using it at night. But then every color gets reversed."
B0791VS3N9,D. Berg,4,"If you're looking for a new Android phone and don't want to pay the ridiculous prices for a Samsung or LG or all the others charge, this might be a good option for you. But be advised, the camera / picture quality is not great compared to an iPhone 7 / iPhone 8 or Samsung. I did a comparison this weekend at my son's football game and this phone does not measure up to the quality and resolution that even my old 2014 Motorola Nexus 6 offered. The pictures are OK but not great. You might want to spend a little more to get a better camera section if pictures are a top priority. Everything else on the phone is great. A+ lightweight, nice touch screen, runs fast and has plenty of storage. Overall Rating is 4 stars."
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,5,"In general I love the phone. However I began to notice a problem with notification with two apps. One is ebay the second is my ring doorbell app. For one the ringdoor bell app is missing the app ring tone page to customize notification. Spoke to RIng and he mention this is a problem with certain phone, though he did not mention Huawei in particularly. Also missed some Ring notification until I manually brought up the app. My ebay notification for some reason have stopped working. I have adjusted battery optimization and notification setting for ebay app and got it to work once and then stopped again. Still working on the these two problems. I have noticed searching the web that other people have complained about the same problem with Huawei phones in general. If I can get this resolve I will have to buy a different phone.

I seem to have gotten the notifications working again. You have the adjust the battery optimization settings on a per app basis. I have set ebay to manual control in the battery optimization. I started receiving notification again."
B0791VS3N9,Camisado,5,"Great ""budget"" smartphone! I've had an LG Stylo 3, ZTE Z Max Pro, LG G3, and iPhone 4, and now this Huawei Mate SE is definitely one of the best smartphones I've had. Runs fast and smooth, looks great, battery life is decent (but could be a little better imo), speaker quality and call quality are sufficient. The screen looks awesome and the interface is very responsive on all apps so far! I was in between this and the Honor 7X and from what I've read so far I'm happy with my decision. I'm using MetroPCS as phone carrier. Really enjoy this phone and I'm looking forward to the update to Android 8 Oreo (EMUI 8)!

UPDATE: I received the update to Android 8 Oreo/EMUI 8!! This is a great phone for a great price! :)"
B0791VS3N9,M. Chua,5,"Great phone, everything works and now with Oreo it runs even smoother. Multitasking( nav in small window while I browse home) and split windows work smoothly. I had honor 5x prior to this phone and I am quite happy with the purchase. I play emulators for the psone and psp in this phone. Works great so far only psp games have some sound and lag issues now and then."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I've only ever had cheap phones, and this too can be considered a cheap phone by some, but the quality is outstanding. I love the fingerprint sensor feature and the large screen. It also runs many apps without lagging and the battery seems to last forever which is surprising since I seem to be on my phone 24/7. The picture quality is still very good -not $1000 iPhone quality- but it has a multitude of cool filters to choose from. It is also not exactly a device I would play music on without headphones because the sound is tinny. I bought a wallet case and a screen protector for this phone. The screen protector may make the screen a little less sensitive, and it is also sometimes hard to unlock the phone via fingerprint because of the case, but I find that these add ons make using this phone more convenient overall."
B0791VS3N9,Danny legendre,4,"I went to Bestbuy to buy this phone after looking at it on their display lineup and they no longer have it in stock. At all. They don't sell it anymore so I bought it from Amazon. Great phone with great specs. It is fast and smooth. The camera is great. Low light can be bad but there is an option to lighten up the photo if you tap on the screen before you take the picture. Nice big screen, thin and only 250 bucks. I will never sign a contract where I pay monthly for a phone and then through the nose for a plan as long as I can find homes like this one. Only downside is it is operating Android 7.0. so sending a gif in a text is not possible. Not a deal breaker but annoying. Waiting for the update."
B0791VS3N9,Grouchyf,5,I set this up to wake up the phone or answer calls using the finger print scanner. It works every time! Display is beautiful and responsive. My wife and I both have Huawei phones and love them. Great bang for your buck.
B0791VS3N9,c.k. of l.a.,4,"Best budget phone in my opinion. Got to try this for half a day when it was sent after cancelling my order.(waiting for the Huawei View).
As with other reviewers, this is smooth as butter, fast, and just beautiful. I read issues about the wifi slowing down when using bluetooth , which I confirmed to be true, but not that bad compared to my Note 5 which slows down too when using both. If not for the upcoming release of the other Mate 10 Pro variant, I would have kept this one. If the ""View"" won't impress me, I might just reorder this one again."
B0791VS3N9,Aaron Johnson,5,"Everything works as intended on this phone, camera stabilization isn't what I was used to, however given the price point and coming from a flagship this was more than acceptable since I don't take many pictures. battery lasts me a good 3 days of normal use, 4 if skip out playing games on my lunch break. Got it used with a minor scratch on the rear. You will need a case of some kind as the phone feels slick with dry hands, which thankfully it came with a clear rubber one. update pushes have been steady and feels like they push more updates than my old phone which I'm grateful for, makes me feel like the product will continue to be supported rather than left and forgotten after a year. The finger print reader is hella fast and 90%+ it gets it the first time even with sloppy pressing."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"Very affordable phone with big screen and fast processor. I don't play games on my phone, but it's got more than enough juice to handle Netflix and Youtube. The call quality is great. The fingerprint sensor on the back is very fast. The only negative is that I could do more with the fingerprint sensor on my old Honor 5. On my old phone, I could launch different apps using different fingerprints, so that made it very convenient to make calls and play music on the fly. This phone doesn't seem to offer this function, otherwise it would be a 5-star rating."
B0791VS3N9,mrmas,5,"Love this phone! I have had it for several months. This is the first non flagship phone that I have owned. The only thing it is missing is NFC, which I don't use anyway. Bloatware is almost non existent. User interface is smooth. Phone is plenty powerful. Camera is acceptable. The phone is a nice size. The screen, while not OLED, is of solid quality. I love that it has a micro SD card slot, although if we are being honest, is not as big of a deal as it once was. My experience with this phone has been so positive that my Sister and Dad have both purchased one too. Solid purchase."
B0791VS3N9,Robert P.,5,"Had this product for many months now and have loved using it so far. Very snappy and great value for the price. I recently noticed my fingerprint sensor not registering very well and called Huawei's customer service, and they instantly let me send the item to them for repair free of charge and with free shipping! :)"
B0791VS3N9,John,5,"This phone is overall amazing for it's price! As everyone said in the reviews section, the pros of this phone are quite exemplary. Amazing interface the phone is lightweight, and everything is just good. Understand that the good comes with the bad and this phone has some bad features such as sometimes poor camera quality.

I really don't know much about phones. I've been an Apple user and this was such a different kind of place, but a good kind of place you know? I'm really surprised with this phone though. I've abused it so much (dropped it, installed some extensive things, sat on it, used it for 20 hours no break) but this phone didn't seem to become worn. Everytime the phone faces adversity, it kept plowing through and just kept working. Even though there were some times that it had froze or shut done unexpectedly, I believe it was my fault for overdoing it a little bit too much.

So yeah! I love this phone and wouldn't want to part with it! It has everything I need and want and that's good!"
B0791VS3N9,Melvin Jafet Vasquez,5,"I love this phone. Great features for a fraction of what Samsung and Apple would charge for a similar unit. Of course, these expensive brands will give you a better camera when it comes to image quality but the Huawei camera on this phone is great and with the rest of the features, ram, storage, etc, you can not go wrong!!! I would buy it again and probably my next phone will be a Huawei."
B0791VS3N9,Michael G,5,I've only had this phone for 2 weeks but I couldn't be more pleased. I bought this phone to replace the Oukitel Ok6000 which I had for about two weeks and dropped from about a foot and the screen cracked and I'm happy it did because then I bought this phone which was supposed to be my work phone but I have since switched the SIM cards and made this my primary phone and made my Samsung Galaxy s9($950) my secondary phone. In my opinion this phone is better than the Samsung and for $700 less if I had only known. The only question left for me is will it last and I would guess that it will being it appears to be well made with quality materials. I would definitely buy this phone again and would highly recommend this product!
B0791VS3N9,Mel A. Abraham,5,"I can get reception where my wife's iPhones can't. For the price, this is the best smart phone I have ever had. I have had iPhone and Samsung before this and I'm sticking with this brand. Battery lasts longer too."
B0791VS3N9,Amazonion Purchaser Guy,5,"Overall I really like this phone. Haven't had any issues with it, has lots of storage space, fast, fingerprint works. By far my best phone yet. Thinking about upgrading to an iPhone but honestly this phone is close to just as good so it's hard to think about switching when this works fine. Only gripe is the text messaging wouldn't send pictures, I had to install another texting app and that sends them as a group message to the sender and sends my text back to me as well which is annoying but that's more of a software issues. Want to root it but it seems tricky to unlock it. Has a little bit of bloatware but nothing much. Overall a great deal for the money. Any other brand Android would cost about twice as much for a phone this good."
B0791VS3N9,Teratomazon,5,"This is a fantastic phone! Compared to ANY phone in this price range, it is the best! Not sure I'm a ""power user"" but I use a lot of graphics and drawing apps, as well as a highly-customized launcher and keypad. As reasonably priced as this phone is, $250+ is still a big purchase for me. And this is one that I am very happy to have made!

Haven't experienced a ""con"" yet. And the Oreo update rolled out last week!"
B0791VS3N9,Christian L.,5,"I went from an LG V10 to this Huawei Mate SE. My LG V10 failed on me twice. This Huawei phone is already miles ahead of my LG product. If you want an excellent phone at a great price, look no further. This thing puts phones at three times the price to shame. Good job on this one Huawei. I'm not brand loyal by any means. I've had Sony, Samsung, HTC, LG and other smartphones, but if Huawei keeps this kind of quality product and prices, they've just made a customer for life."
B0791VS3N9,KyleStyle,5,"Transitioned to this from a galaxy s6. This is an amazing budget phone, you can't beat it at the price. Much better than the honor 7x as you get an extra gig of ram and twice the storage. Great battery life, beatiful screen

My only complaints:
Screen scratches easily. I've constantly used tempered glass screen protectors to help stop that.
Still no Oreo update in May of 2018.. but it is supposed to be here anytime.
App crashed are random.. far in between, but random and unexpected.

Got an additional one for my wife and talking my grandmother into transitioning from her galaxy s5 to this too."
B0791VS3N9,AROD,5,"Excellent phone...I have on At&t and works great ...Yes I have 4G LTE ..The speed is better than any phone out there..Looks really nice..you get so much its worth it... First you get 64 GB alone then 4 gig of Ram.. also it updated to Android Oreo....listen plain and simple want a phone with all stuff you need get this phone

Note : no NFC ..but I don't use google pay..and the battery is not removable...but for me who cares the price is right.

For $229 ..You Can't complain."
B0791VS3N9,Margie,5,"The Huawei Mate SE is the best budget phone I've ever purchased. For $229 is was an absolute steal. The phone arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. Everything about it says high quality. The free case they throw in is good quality, fits well, and looks nice. The build quality on this phone looks nice and is very solid. That being said the phone is very light and feels good in the hand. The screen quality of the display is also very nice and it gets very bright in direct sunlight for easy readability. The operating system is filled with options and is not limited like other budget devices. Sound quality is very good and call quality is excellent. On T-Mobile I have had less calls drop then on the Moto Z2 Force which was purchased through T-Mobile. WiFi works extremely well even without the ability to use 5G WiFi. Overall, I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a great budget device or primary device at a great price. This is my new daily driver."
B0791VS3N9,Lauren Lee,2,"I use my phone primarily to listen to music, videos, podcasts, and audio books, both with and without headphones or bluetooth. My old LG G4 for $250 has a great speaker and this phone was no where close to the same speaker quality. The speaker on this phone is quiet, shrill, and very poor quality even when using the headphone jack. I returned it."
B0791VS3N9,Thomas Burton,5,"If you're tech savy enough you can pretty much have the best of ios and the best of android on this phone with ease. Since hauwei did the first pixel. You know, the pixel that actually worked properly. I'm not surprised at all at what a wonderful job they've done with this phone. Ill be a customer for life if they can keep this up. Even replacing it once a year at this price beats buying 1 flagship. You can break it 4 times and replace it. You can also have the same experience during that time frame but for much cheaperIt might not be ip rated or having wireless charging or a fast charging butttttttt. It's got everything else. It's brilliant."
B0791VS3N9,birdmom9726,4,"This is a pretty good Android phone. The fingertip lock is in a weird place, on the back of the phone, but after a while you get used to that. My big beef with this phone is that, no matter what I try, the sound for an incoming text message is so faint as to be almost indeciperable. And when you're waiting for a text, that is an important feature. My late iPhone had a nice clear bell tone that was easy to hear, but this phone just doesn't seem to have the capacity for a loud text alert. If anyone else has solved this problem, I'd love to hear about it. Otherwise, I'm happy with itl"
B0791VS3N9,John Moeses Bauan,4,"I've been using this phone for around 10 months now and so far I am pretty happy with it. Given the price, this phone is amazing. Fast, fluid and not heavy at all. The only thing I can tell the doesn't work very well is the automatic turn off of the screen when you're calling: sometimes the screen turns on and you realize you've accidentaly opened some of the apps, or turn on/off the wifi/Bluetooth/etc."
B0791VS3N9,Surrealfool,4,"Pros:
* Excellent screen size
* 64GB space/4GB RAM
* Great battery life
* Beautiful display
* Runs fast and smooth with the 2.36GHz octa-core processor
* Bang for your $$
Cons:
* Cannot pick up my GPS signal after about 4 months of use
* Disappointed with GSM only, I've had terrible luck with AT&T
* Camera's not bad for the price but I'm not impressed with the picture quality in low light"
B0791VS3N9,milktea,3,"Honestly not everything it's made out to be. It is aesthetically pleasing, and good for the price. But the camera isn't all that and it runs like shit after like 6 months."
B0791VS3N9,bb,5,"Love the phone! Specially once updated to Android Oreo it's definitely the best phone in this price range and above period! Can do stuff even my friends with iPhones are jeleous! Camera is good, fuzzy in low light though but definitely good in normal/well lit places. The quality of this phone is amazing I paired it off with some all metal gray ziomi headphones and couldn't he happier! The grey metallic shine definitely makes it feel like it's a good quality build, also like the fact that it came with a clear gel case. Face and fingerprint recognition is super fast. Works with Cricket and has plenty of options. I know the huwai OS/UI can be a hit or miss but I enjoy it simple but can be customized to suit your likings like androids. 64gb and the ability to upgrade to 256gb down the road is a huge plus! Love the fact that I can videos in small screen formal while using the internet or another app, super useful!"
B0791VS3N9,uncanny,4,"Odd thing I noticed after using this phone for a few days: I'm left handed, therefore I hold the phone with my left hand and support it with my right thumb.
Unfortunately the speaker is exactly in the spot where my thumb goes on the bottom. I keep turning up the volume, wondering why the sound is so low. Then I move my thumb and it's loud.

No other issues I can think of yet after using it for less than a week. Will update later if anything comes up."
B0791VS3N9,Carlos Martinez,5,"I've only been using this phone for a week, but the first impression couldn't be better. Fast, reliable and, even though I'm not a photographer, I think that pictures are more than decent. Screen is big and bright, nice resolution. Totally worth it considering the price point."
B0791VS3N9,M,5,I chose to switch to the Huawei mate se after a TON of research. I've had it alitte over 7 months now and couldn't be happier. The battery life is amazing. The picture quality it amazing. The price is amazing. The phone itself is amazing! This is the brand I will chose from now on. I switched from an iPhone and will never go back or buy a phone over $300 again.
B0791VS3N9,Ed,5,"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. My research on this product was it had a larger batter a good battery life, it did not disappoint. She primarily used the phone for calls, text and occasional photo. The battery last for 4 or 5 days. She is very happy. Happy wife happy life ð. We would recommend this product. As for the 4 stars for picture quality i am not sure if is the camera or our ability to use it properly. We have taken some very good pictures and some not so good. We are leaning on we need more practice."
B0791VS3N9,Steffan Shephard,4,"The device is a premium built device. Display quality is also very good. However, the sound quality is poor. At it's loudest the speaker sounds muffle and distorted.

My only other gripe is that when I am downloading files (personal privately owned) and try to play a video simultaneously the video freezes. This never happened with my P9 lite which only had 2GB memory."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"Like it so far. A bit slower on some games than iPhone 8, some weird patterning issues in background stuff, can't change notification volumes without changing ringtone volumes.
Nice weight, nice size.
Color palette is a rude awakening after Basic Amoled Galaxy for the past 5 years. Hurts my eyes a bit even with eye safe setting and twilight. No auto-stabilizing on video and photo. This is a biggie if you like to take photos. Still a good camera, though, even if low-light (as many people have said) is not good. Battery? Better by far for certain games than a similarly aged iPHone 8. Lighter than iphone 8 even with the Spigen case on. REALLY light with the provided Huawei case on. Overall, a good deal on a great phone. No real complaints."
B0791VS3N9,D. Jones,5,"After a month I'm very happy with the Mate SE, much more so than the Honor 6X (which I returned). Bright screen, always super fast, uses the 4G LTE bands that AT&T operates on in my area, really good call quality, more than ample storage, decent-or-better camera, and the EMUI is more customizable than the Honor 6X's version. The fingerprint sensor is a welcome time saver.

The phone has only two mild downsides for me: 1. The media speaker placement and volume aren't great, but they aren't horrible either, and I don't need booming speakers from a phone. 2. The notification LED didn't work until I downloaded, installed and configured the Light Flow app. Now the LED works. It's small and dim compared to what I was used to, but it's visible enough.

The Mate SE ships with a case but I opted to buy a tougher one, the Spigen. https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Huawei-Resilient-Absorption/dp/B076V3D2F5/ref=sr_1_2?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1529708632&sr=1-2&keywords=huawei+mate+se+spigen Glad I did. Dropping phones had been rare for me, but I managed to drop this one twice in only a month, and with no ill effects on it. Would the standard case have protected it? I'll never know and I don't care. I trust the case I bought."
B0791VS3N9,Suzy Q,5,"Seriously, this is the best cell phone I've had. My last phone was an LGG4 and this phone is light years better. I don't read much into the whole US government vs Huawei bs. if you are looking for a premium phone at a budget price, this is the phone to buy."
B0791VS3N9,Omar O.,5,"I have been very impressed by this phone, I have been using it for the past 3 months and have only good things to say about it. People also are very impressed by the design some believing its an iPhone. It clearly has an iPhone design its very sleek and light, the fingerprint sensor is super fast. You cant go wrong with this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Big Steve,4,"This Mate SE is my second Huawei and has a few shortcomings. It will not access a 5G wireless router whereas my 5 yr old Mate 2 would do so. The battery life is shorter than my Mate 2, but not a real problem.
Having said that, in other ways, the Mate SE is superior. The display is clearer; the colors more vivid, the camera superior, the bluetooth is far better, the overall speed of all the functions is pretty amazing
Setup was extremely easy, and all of my settings, contacts, apps, etc, imported via Google with just one touch. I don't swallow the spying nonsense and barely gave the spiel a thought. I would recommend this phone with the caveat about the 5G and battery life."
B0791VS3N9,Samantha Fernandez,5,"This phone is simply awesome, if you overlook the charging type, it is the best phone out there for the price. The colors are gorgeous, I love the size, and as an audiophile, the output of sound when connected to my car speakers is super clear and has loud bass. I really am proud that I trusted the reviews on here, before this phone I owned a ZTE Axon 7 Mini and I was in love with it, until it broke from one simple fall. I was worried that this phone wouldn't meet my expectations when it came to sound output etc but oh boy IT DOES. Apart from that make sure to get a good cover for this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Poco,5,"I placed the order for a new Huawei Mate SE phone Sunday and got it 2 days later as anyone would expect via Amazon Prime. I have been waiting for my holiday gift since the order was completed at Amazon. This is my second Huawei phone. So, my expectation is very high. I have had my Huawei Mate 8 for almost 3 years with great experience: great battery life, much better camera than other big name's, running smoothly, and no damages after dropping many times etc. I still use it with little issues. So, I decided to get a Huawei phone again for next 3 years or longer hopefully. This time, I like to get a smaller screen size, specifically a little less wide than Mate 8's. After finishing my order at Amazon, I can't wait for receiving the new phone - Huawei Mate SE. Wow, it is an amazing phone after playing it a little bit. The size is just a great fit with my hands. Installing a few popular Apps runs very smooth. There are a lot of popular Apps pre-loaded on the Mate SE. I will explore more features on this Huawei Mate SE..."
B0791VS3N9,Freviewer,5,"This phone is fantastic and screaming value.
The form factor is great (thin and tall with small bezel and soft angles), the screen and camera are really good, and the (active) dual SIM card feature a godsend for foreign travelers like me. it feels like a much more premium phone. Too early to say how durable battery will be, but so far so good easily a (light) day use and more. Couldn't be happier."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"- Battery with amazing life lasts for entire day and even more, I spend all the day using mobile data for my social media work, at the end of the day is still 40%

- Software is good, and will get even better with the new OREO update that huawei confirmed will come soon

- Fast and smooth no bugs or lags, even amazing for games and never heat

- Camera is good, not as good as the 1100$ iphone or 800$ samsung note8, but comparing the proce difference, it is good

- Now some might say that its not good cz there is no NFC, or fast charging, or low volume level;
I say that i don't care, I never use the NFC tech, and the battery is more than good it lasts the entire day, no need for fast charging during the day, and the volume is acceptable

so if you want a mobile that is fast, up to date, great battery with an amazing price 229$, this is the one
but if you are looking for a mobile only for the top camera and loud volume speakers, this is not your choice"
B0791VS3N9,HVAC/R Bart,5,"Awesome value, buy this phone. Only things missing, NFC, temperature and some other none important feature. Check the Hauwei web site to find other unmentioned features the phone does have. Daylight pictures are outstanding, night time pictures could be better. If picture taking is your main concern buy a camera, the pictures this phone takes are good enough for most. Buy the phone and enjoy all that it can do including Android 8.0 which will update when you start the phone."
B0791VS3N9,Jennifer Spacek,5,"I was sceptical to buy a phone off of Amazon. I mean I had bought phones off Craigslist and FB but for some reason I was still hesitant. That being said this is the coolest phone. The battery lasts for days with moderate use, like during the work day where im maybe not doing as much browising I only charge it every 3 days. Three days! Without having to charge my phone!! Sorry but having converted from the iPhone that was insane to me. Oh and the phone was brand new in the box everything worked out fine. I popped my SD card from my iPhone into the Huawei and it worked immediately."
B0791VS3N9,trumpetmom12,5,"Very good phone at a reasonable price. Many people ask me if it is an iphone. I teach school as a subtitute and go to a lot of different schools. The High School and Middle School students tell me it has a lot of nice features and the comment is almost always, ""I thought it was an Ipnone."" Functionality is excellent. I haven't owned a lot of nice phones so this is by far the best I have had. Only issue I have is it takes a little longer to charge than I was expecting. My husband has the same phone and does not have this issue with his."
B0791VS3N9,Kip,5,"Galaxy S series is overrated. This machine does all you need at a fraction cost. If there was a 7 of 5 rating I would. Am able to minimize youtube, gps etc while still using other applications. Forget about split screen. This phone gives you a floating youtube or gps screens etc that you can move anywhere on the screen so you can easily multitask."
B0791VS3N9,BOSS,2,"The product is good. and works great. The price is good. The only glaring problem i have is that the phone is not fully encrypted like the majority of other phones. As good as this phone is, and it is good... if i would have known this before buying, i would not have gotten this phone. I value my privacy."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I've now had this phone for over a month, so I feel like I can give some feedback and judge the phone objectively. Note that for work I have an iPhone 8, and went to this Mate SE from a Blu Life X2 after it took a tumble.

Phone as a whole:
It's nicely built and looks sleek and modern, as expected from Huawei. The back finger print scanner works extremely well. The size is good for my hands and I can reach all of the screen with my thumb one handed. All apps run smoothly and I haven't had any issues yet. The speaker phone is nice and loud, not too tin can sounding.

Screen:
Bright colors, compared to the iPhone 8, the colors are very comparable. No issues with videos at all.

Battery:
I play Pokemon Go, and I have hosted 2 other devices (kids) with this phone for 4 hours straight and went from 100% to 25%... the kids phones were dying. Brother in law's Samsung Galaxy new version was also in the red. So... pretty nice. For standard usage, this phone lasts all day. Very impressed.

Camera:
Clearly it's not an iPhone, but the pictures are more or less comparable to the iPhone 8. It's not 100% there, but it's crisp enough to print out pictures with Santa.

In all, the wife likes it so I'm buying one for her too. I'd give it 9/10 stars as it's clearly not a flagship phone, but who cares, it's $250."
B0791VS3N9,ben akin,5,"This is an awesome phone considering the price point. I already own a blu vivo 8 and this is a much better phone in terms of performance. The mate SE runs very smooth with little to no lag. The phone just performs like a flagship phone. i really don't care that it doesn't have usb type c because all my previous phones were micro usb. except the Blu pure xr which i owned briefly. The only issue i have with the phone is the display which comes out of the box looking a little bit too warm. Luckily , this can be adjusted in the display setting menu. The colors on the display are a little bit muted and i would have loved it if it was more saturated , which would have let the colors pop out more. I wish they would have put a color saturation slider in the settings menu, honestly i don't know why phone makers don't have this option by default (The closest i have seen to it is video enhance on the note 8). This phone seems to have the same color issue with the Pixel XL 2, although google fixed that with an update. I hope Huawei will also update the color saturation and make it more vivid. This is still a fantastic phone, which i have no regrets buying. I have no problem recommending this phone.
Update: I recently noticed that the brightness of the screen would automatically dim when I open apps even though I have got auto brightness set to off. Huawei needs to look into this issue."
B0791VS3N9,Dave,5,"Bought this phone as a backup for my Huawei Honor 8. Good phone, but not as good as my original Honor 8, so I gave it to my daughter. She loves it!
Also recommended it to a couple friends to replace their old Samsung's & the like their Mate SE's too!
Overall great product at a great price!"
B0791VS3N9,J. A.,2,"This cellphone is not much different than any other cellphone I've owned. Is OK nothing out of the ordinary. I bought it after reading many reviews, but I'm not impressed by its performance. Is just a cellphone people. I have nothing negative to write about this phone. So, feel free to buy it, you won't be disappointed. I'm not . âº"
B0791VS3N9,M Sa,5,"Very fast. I have a galaxy s7 and it is a pretty good phone, but mate se is faster. For a budget phone it is very good. The camera is not as good as s7, but it costs much less. In bright situation the photos are good, but in low light situation the image quality goes down. The finger print on this phone is VERY fast! just a touch and it is unlocked. The position is very good, it lets you to drop down the notification bar which is good for a person with small hand.

Overall, good phone at a very good price."
B0791VS3N9,Justin,5,If you want a great phone with amazing battery life at a $250 price tag than this is it. I've been a Google Nexus phone user for years. But I couldn't pull myself to spend $800-$900 on a Pixel. Plus insurance and if something happened to the phone. It's a huge headache. Long story short I got a cheaper phone and I love it. The battery on this thing is incredible! I could go 2 days with normal use easily. It's a quick and very responsive phone. Anyway if you want a great phone at a great price you found it!!
B0791VS3N9,dbz,5,"This is my 2nd Huawei phone. The first one I bought during a trip to Asia unfortunately was not compatible with the US networks. This one completely works! I've got LTE through TMobile. Happy with the 64gb memory and battery life. Rear camera isn't bad, simulates the blurring or bokeh effect of the iPhone by having dual rear cameras. Fingerprint reader works faster than that of my wife's iPhone. For all the hardware available: 64gb memory (expandable with micro SD) octacore processor, HD+ screen, 3340 mAmp battery, its really worth the price."
B0791VS3N9,Daniel Lewis,2,"I had to relearn android with this new phone from an iPhone. Fast processor, cool fearures, fairly serviceable phone.

However I just discovered an issue that may be a deal breaker. Just got off the phone with Huawei support and they said there is no fix to my problem.
While on a phone call, every time I click on something the person on the other end can hear All the clicks. If you jump into say Facebook they can hear the videos you are playing, Yikes!

Huawei support just gave me the impression that that is "" normal"" and there is no fix for it.

I will check to see if there is an Android fix for this to be certain and update this review if I find a fix. If not sending phone back."
B0791VS3N9,Melina,5,"I've only had this phone two weeks now. I honestly love it. Looks great, is small and comfortable, and is fast, to boot! I'm very pleased. I was skeptical because I can't even pronounce the brand name, nor have I heard of it before. However, it's been treating me well and has exceeded my expectations. The camera is pretty decent, as well (something I was concerned about). Definitely a better quality phone than the price leads you to believe. If you're on the fence, I suggest you take the plunge."
B0791VS3N9,JG,5,"I have had the phone for a couple months now. I am coming from an HTC Desire 510 with 8 gigs of storage.. 8 gigs! So anything would have been an upgrade. One problem I had initially with the Mate SE was that I couldn't receive mms messages (group, Pic, sound texts, etc.) I figured out I had to reset some apn settings I found on cricket's website. Some negatives: the sound quality isn't the best, but it's as if I have gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. The phone has also spontaneously restarted itself a few times, but it's not been a big deal. It feels like good sturdy hardware but it is very smooth and slippery. I'm happy using the clear tpu case it came with. The camera is fine for my standards. I like the 64 gigs of storage and 4 gigs of memory. It's pretty zippy. I LOVE the fingerprint scanner on the back and the ability to pull down notifications with it. The scanner is fast and accurate. I like the display. I'm using a nova launcher and it all functions great. Very happy for the price I paid."
B0791VS3N9,Dilip Patel,5,"After using iphone since its introduction, never thought would like any other phone. After getting tired of low quality voice reception and battery and cost of new iphone, settled for Huawei unlocked phone after lots of hesitation. Surprisingly, this turned out to be great pick and happy with the purchase. I like my phone to have good quality phone voice quality and reception, good emailing and good pictures. This phone does not disappoint. Expensive phones finally have a competition."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"For $229. What a nice phone, does everything as advertised without a glitch and at very fast speeds. Enjoy it way more than the iPhone 5c it replaced, really like the drag accross the screen to type feature, and great to increase your memory with a SD card. Most normal people will not be disappointed with this purchase unless if you need the option of sending videos via SMS, which it doesn't offer. Thanks Amazon"
B0791VS3N9,Mrs,5,"I like the most is very quick to transfer my old phone into my new phone without calling tracfone company just answer all the question in the phone,the camera really good,and the battery last longer until i get home from work,,maps is good .Its look very nice ,thin and brand new you can compare of ipone quality.I recommend this product if you want to save money no monthly bills just load one time in a yr and watch before expiration you can load more mins,its depends also how you use it.whats inside the box,adptor charger, pin and basic bookletguide ,i didnt read all yet whats inside if they have warranty,Only 1slot drawer for nano sims card and sdcard small size.I love my phone"
B0791VS3N9,TheHatter,5,This phone lived up to all my expectations and more. I was on the fence with this phone and the Moto g6..but the specs for the mate was much better not to mention the dual SIM cards. If you're looking for a great non-flaghip phone with flagship specs this is the phone for you. Oh and it works flawlessly with MetroPCS/TMobile.
B0791VS3N9,Karthik,3,"I am giving my opinion and fact on this product. Many people tend to buy this product mainly for dual sim feature. Unfortunately this mobile will not suit this requirement for the following facts.

When I purchased this product, I went through many reviews in Amazon and based on some satisfaction I went ahead and ordered but got to know after receiving that the second slot which can be used for either second SIM or for memory card supports only 2g. So I am in United States and in this country mobile providers have discontinued 2g long back, very very limited tower gives you 2g signal. My second number which is from India is 4g sim, it did not work as expected in this mobile due to the second slot supporting only 2g. I did not get signal for second slot and I got signal only once for few minutes.

So in my opinion, this mobile is not fit for dual sim facility in ðºð¸ United States. This mobile might work good in other country where 2g signal are available.

Since I haven't used the mobile much, I am not giving my feedback on mobile other features like camera, etc.

Hope this helps for customers who are looking this mobile for dual sim facilities."
B0791VS3N9,r. castillo,5,"Wow I am impressed. I have an iPhone 7 which is great no complaints but got bored of it. I wanted something different and I happened to see the Huawei phone and the price was reasonable.

Im disappointed with the phone selection in the US. After looking online at phones across the pond , I realized there are more devices available that we never hear of in the US. Anyway, I gambled and received it today. I've been messing with it for a few hours and am impressed with the response no lag time.

Fortuantely, I already have AT&T and slipped in the Sim from my iPhone 7, no problems with the LTE and it connected to my router with no problems either. I'm just glad that I didn't have to spend $700+ for a another phone. I'll be putting my iPhone on eBay!"
B0791VS3N9,Chris Pfeifer,5,"I have been using this phone for a few weeks now. This may not be a ""flagship"" phone, but it sure feels and runs like one. If price and quality are important, then this is definitely the phone for you. I use my phone for everything, browsing the web, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon. It's also my only phone, no landline. I've owned several Galaxy series phones, the old lady used them, I wouldn't trade two of her s7's for one mate se. This doesn't have some of the most up to date features, but I haven't found that it takes away from the experience. This not only feels like a quality phone, it operates like one."
B0791VS3N9,agrissom,5,"I recently retired. I was issued an iPhone 6 plus at work. I decided that I did not want an IOS device and decided to shop Android devices.
This phone is a great balance of features vs. price I've had for 1 week.

The good:
Good battery life
Great screen
Very responsive
Easy to use
Pretty good camera
Super fast fingerprint reader
Very reliable so far.

The bad:
Shaky video
Low light photos a little grainy
Hard to pronounce phone name Huawei (wowway) :-)"
B0791VS3N9,marclow001,5,"Nice phone. It's a steal at around $200. 4gb of ram, 5.9"" screen and a lot of customization to this phone. Loaded up all my apps from my old phone, no performance hit at all. That 4gb of ram is really showing on this phone. My available memory stay above 2gb. The battery life on this phone has been solid for me. If the phone is optimize it will slowly trickle. But we will see how that last."
B0791VS3N9,Ronald Coggins,5,"OMG I love this phone! It has all the power I need to do any task I need it to do. And there is no bloatware on it like other proprietary phones. Just android plain and simple. The camera is awesome. Front AND back. Seriously, why pay 500 or a thousand bucks when you can pay 200 and get nearly the same quality? I'm completely happy with my purchase. iPhone who?"
B0791VS3N9,J&R,5,"This phone is a great value for money. It has proven to very stable, smooth to operate and has great battery time. The camera is reasonable for the price and every other feature I need in a phone meets or exceeds my expectation. The phone feels and functions like a premium phone."
B0791VS3N9,jimmy,2,Way too many apps open unintentionally. If I wore a sports jacket where I could keep the phone inside the breast pocket it may work-or a woman carrying a purse with a designated isolated pocket inside the purse for the phone yes maybe. With the push switches extruded from the side of phone one is asking for trouble. I do not like wearing blue jeans but have found they are the easiest and safest for roaming the world. The only way around this is to turn off phone. Then you have to turn it on before using. The size of phone is too long for an isolated front shirt pocket to button up. Even then you may get assaulted and loose phone anyway. Many times I find my front jean pocket is getting warm. Maybe 5 apps have opened up and could be calling someone unintentionally at the same time and battery will be very warm. You have to keep all pressure from these push witches. Also when I misplace my phone it will not ring using skype. Use to find my old phone maybe once or twice a month using this method. Believe I have found a method to remotely access my voice mail. Use to be a snap before. On the question forum I asked this question using a different profile name. I sure do like the feel of the phone and the rear camera. Hopefully someone will debug my skype problem on the question forum
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"It is pretty fast for the price, and seems to get really good signal for cel, wifi and bluetooth. It isn't a flagship, but honestly I haven't noticed any slowness. I like that it has 4gb of RAM and 64gb flash.

The only issues I've had so far is the tactile stops working in whatsapp (but seems to work elsewhere, so this could be a whatsapp problem - still investigating). That, and I can't figure out how to do a screenshot on it. The power-up-arrow combination starts something that records the screen (video), rather than a screenshot. I just need to look up how.

So far it makes good phone calls, etc."
B0791VS3N9,Tendell Williams,2,I give Two stars because. Incoming calls are not answered by me. The phone does it automatically. I don't know someone called unless I hear them saying hello. I need a replacement
B0791VS3N9,TMC,5,"Did extensive research on the budget smart phones, and no other phone in the high $100 to high $200 range even comes close to the bang-for-the-buck value this phone offers. This is essentially an upgraded Honor 7X, and the extra $30-$50 difference in price for extra RAM and double the storage was definitely worth it. The best value in the next price range ($300 - $400) would be the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, but whether you still consider that to be a budget price range is up to you. Pulled the trigger and bought two Mate SE's, one for me and my wife. The research did not disappoint, we absolutely love these phones, I got the black version, she got the gold. The response of the phone is very snappy, the display is beautiful, and the pics from the dual cameras are great. An upgrade to Oreo O/S was immediately available once I got the phone up and running, so that was fantastic, as well."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,2,"This phone looks fantastic. It runs great and I love the extra screen room it gave compared to my older phones. However, the hardware inside is really, really cheap. It took less than 3 months for the headphone jack to break, and while my headphones did get ripped out of it often, my last phone the Huawei Honor 6x took over a year for the same issue. I got the part replaced and again it took less than 3 months for it to break. Frustrated I bought another part to replace it and found that they started using new parts in the newer models so the old parts weren't in stock anymore, it shouldn't have been an issue except for some stupid reason, the new parts don't fit into the older phones (same model, remember), and the only way I could get the newer parts were to get it shipped form China which takes 3 weeks minimum.

So great phone when it works, which isn't that long at all. Also, if you plan on fixing your own phone, for some reason, this model doesn't show up at all when you look for parts for it, it uses parts from the honor 7x which really makes me wonder if this is a separate phone at all.If you plan on buying a cheaper phone, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, other Huawei products are way better and honestly, they have better competition at Xiaomi anyways."
B0791VS3N9,Squidman,5,"This is a good phone if you want most of the features and performance of a high end phone but don't want to spend $1,000. It's decently powerful, it works perfectly for Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, web browsing, and a few simple games I tried. The sound and camera aren't as great as some of the flagship phones, but they are decent. The battery is pretty big so it should last all day for casual use, if you aren't running 50 things with the brightness cranked. It also comes with a free clear case which is nice, most companies don't do that. So it's great for casual users unless you really want to spend 4-5x as much for a flagship phone."
B0791VS3N9,Termain Brice,5,"Just got this phone ... Upgraded from a LG Aristo 2. I'm a MetroPCS customer ..... Swapping service to new phone was simple as well as transferring apps...simple
The phone display is so vivid .. the fingerprint thingy is quick. Love love love this phone. Didn't want a contract to get an iPhone or Galaxy. Great price 4 a Great device !!! Definitely recommend this phone for bargain hunters ð¤¤"
B0791VS3N9,Chris,4,The charging port is not USB Type C which is a real bummer. Anyone who has converted to the Type C connector will know how much better it is. I just converted most of my cables to Type C and when this phone arrived I was shocked to see the antiquated micro USB connector that is a decade old. Yikes.
B0791VS3N9,Lidia_Will,5,"I LOVE this phone..
The best budget phone, I've owned thus far.
1. The fingerprint scanner opens faster than any budget Samsung device I previously owned, and it's easily accessible compared to budget Samsung devices.
2. The display... AMAZING
3. SPEED!!! It's really quick
4. Space... Unbelievable for the price.
I'm completely happy with my phone.

The only draw back is the camera, while it's way better than other Samsung budget phones... It's not that gr8. But all things considering, I got really good specs on a budget & I don't regret it.

Thank you Huaweið"
B0791VS3N9,Tonya,3,"I had the honor 6x it was great. So I was hoping the 7x was going to be better.... Nope. The battery life is awful. With regular normal use it's dead and needing recharged by like 5-6pm.
It also has Bluetooth - and wifi connectivity issues... Which after researching I seen this has been a flaw.
The camera doesn't seem as great.
The phone is kinda slow and it should not be.
My husband got the honor 7A. Since we are being honest, save the $100 bucks and go with it. It has more features. His battery last all day. And..... Well.. the dual cameras aren't worth the extra $. Just saying.
Also... Case selection for these phones suckkk."
B0791VS3N9,K. Luczywo,5,"Only one day in and I am blown away. I had a surprise last week when my Samsung S8 screen stopped working all of a sudden (no drop, nothing). Took it for a screen replacement which was going to cost $229 plus tax. Got a phone call from the tech saying the motherboard was shot. Awesome.

Anyway. After a bunch of research I decided to pull the trigger on this budget phone. I liked the aluminum back and the specs seemed good enough. So happy!!

The UI is better than Samsung's for sure. Photos not quite as good. Speed seems the same in apps. Fingerprint on this is far superior to the S8 (better placement and faster).

I'm really impressed. And heck. If something happens to it I am only out $229. Win win. By this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Customer,5,"I've had this phone for around 4 months now and couldn't have asked for more in this price range. I have always bought mid-range phones, trying for the biggest bang for my money. For it's price, this phone stands out. Processing power, RAM and ROM capacity. The most impressive feature for me is it's camera and display. Picture quality is fantastic, each picture taken is over 5 MB in size illustrating the amount of detail captured. Display is sharp and crisp! A happy customer."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Wow I love this phone! It's huge! It has so many features, great picture taking and I've had zero problems with it! I got this as a birthday gift and I'm sooo happy with it! Only silly complaint is the lack of cute cases for it but seriously this phone is awesome!"
B0791VS3N9,S. Davis,5,"I love this phone. Works very well. Great features. Looks and acts much more high end than it's price would indicate. I bought the gold one, and it looks very classy. I am totally satisfied with my purchase, and the price point was low enough that I will not mind replacing in a few years if needed, unlike with an $800 phone. Glad I took the chance on a brand I was unfamiliar with. Also, Huawei support was great the one time I needed to call them with a question."
B0791VS3N9,Kyle Dunham,4,"Lightning fast, fingerprint scanner is virtually instantaneous, bright HD display, great build quality, clean design, size is just right, and photos are nice and clear. My only real issue with it is that the speaker is very ""tinny"" and lacks bass. The volume can get very loud though thankfully and there is a headphone jack at least. It's an incredible phone for the price and despite the speaker, it's the best smart phone I've had to date (LG V3, LG V20, and ZTE Axon 7)."
B0791VS3N9,squaresquare7,5,I love this phone. It feels well made. I've had not problems with it in the three months I've had it. Camera is pretty good for the price of the phone- especially if the subject is well lit. Not as good at night but I didn't buy it for night photography so that's not really an issue for me.
B0791VS3N9,Jee is King!,5,"This phone is amazing in terms of speed , battery , picture quality etc. For $219, this phone is incredibly better option than Samsung or Apple. They charge you more for their brand name. I am using T Mobile sim card and found no issues with network. One big advantage is the dual SIM card capability. I am very impressed with this phone. Thanks Amazon for selling it and Huawei for selling it at an affordable price."
B0791VS3N9,mike,5,"Switching over from years of LG. My V10 went through batteries like it's no one's business, as did my other LGs. This phone isnt perfect still learning it. The battery life of the huawi is great, never have to take my charger with me last all day and if not using regains some of it's charge. The OS is 8 too that takes time to get used to, what's nice about that is the self cleaning cashe. Doesn't seem to get above 600mb. The LGs had no problem getting over 2gb."
B0791VS3N9,WendyK,5,"I wanted a phone that had a great camera. Check! And great battery life. Check! The camera is the best phone camera I have ever had. In low light, bright light, whatever... It takes fabulous pics. The battery lasts 2 days with pretty heavy usuage! The speaker is very loud too. And it's fast responsive. So many pluses and honestly not any minues I can think of. Buy it! You will not regret it, I promise! XO"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this phone and I was really excited!
Here I can tell you some of my opinion about the huawei
pros:
*Beautiful photos
*Beautiful phone
*Nice resolution
* Just need to put the active sim and it works
/ unlock with your finger

cons:
* it take fooorever to charge the phone, I would say like 5-6 hours to have 90% of battery
* Its not compatible with Fitbit, Garmin, and some headphones
( I am really sad and disappointed because I have a fitbit and a Garmin and my Bluetooth earphones I can only use it with the tablet so I can only use regular headphones
* Because you have so many apps it get really slow"
B0791VS3N9,ithoughtthis,5,"I've never owned a phone that cost over $130 so buying this one was a ""splurge"" for me. I caught it on sale earlier this week for $220 and I'd definitely say it's worth the extra money spent. Fast response times, excellent call clarity, nice design... If you're on the fence like I was because of the extra money, just get it. You'll be glad you did."
B0791VS3N9,Jay,5,"I've had this phone for about a month now and love it. Has the quality of the type of product others are spending upwards of $700 on. Overall, amazingly fast, no crashes at all, can use intensily all day long running a bunch of things at once and still have at least 60% at the end of the day. Camera takes great photos, struggles a little in low light without flash, but what camera doesn't. Photos in natural light come out brilliantly. Runs Bluetooth flawlessly - works great with my ticwatch and uconnect. No issues at all with T-Mobile - put SIM card in, logged in to Google and everything was transferred quickly and seamlessly from old htc phone. I highly recommend it."
B0791VS3N9,Marie S.,5,"I love this phone. It's my first Android and it's beautiful. Graphics are great. Huge memory. It's unlocked for overseas travel. Big bright beautiful screen. The battery life is phenomenal in ""Ultra power saving mode"" I mean phenomenal. It's got a really great camera. And the price!!! Wow!
Goodbye forever Apple!"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Just got it at weekend and now is using this new phone ... Impressively moved by its high quality phone material and great looking design, lighting speed finger ID unlock feature, and long lasting battery, and sharp display image ( but weak point is when you use it at outdoor with sun Glasses on , hardly to see the displayed contents ) , and smooth app response, and great speaker sound quality , camera looks good and I think it has more space to improve , and so many other great features ( so far I don't have not have enough time to check all yet) ...
Anyway, back to the POINT : This is phone is really worth to buy compare with other phones, it is really close to other expensive phones in quality and feature wise but the price is only 1/3 compare with these ''supper expensive phones - i & S '' ( I am these phones user too at same time ).
GO Wow Way, expecting you bring more excitements to this market."
B0791VS3N9,Nojokes,5,"Only an idiot would buy anything costing more than this phone. I have tried the Samsung 9+, IPhone X, and even the Huawei Mate 10. Who are the morons that stick the fingerprint sensor right below the camera lens? What good is that? Touch the sensor and smear the lens.
This is a fantastic phone and it just updated the software to 8. I just put a 256 GB card in it so I can watch Red Dwarf, Green Acres and House on it.
Dear Huawei, I have recommended your phone to megapeople. Not just here on Amazon but person to person, too. I think you might think it appropriate to send me your next gen Mate SE for free!!!!"
B0791VS3N9,Rich W.,5,"I was looking for an upgrade and this phone is awesome! It is fast enough to tackle apps I throw at it and there is no lag with the EMUI interface. You have to be nuts to buy an expensive phone on a contract when this is available, unlocked, at a great price."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"The battery life is awesome! I have never owned a phone that kept a charge as long as this one does, and I do a lot of camera (video) viewing. I love how the phone feels, the size is perfect for me (I like a larger phone) I had this phone for a couple of months now and haven't found one thing I dislike about it. If something changes, I will be the first to write an update. As a side note, I was surprised to see when I turned the phone on, this had step tracker in the lower left hand corner. I believe you can download another tracker that probably gives detailed information but this one is fine for me! All in all, I think anyone who purchases this phone will be quite pleased!"
B0791VS3N9,Riff,5,"when my LG G3 started to fry my battery i new it was time for a new cell phone, but i didnt want to spend $600 plus on a phone.
i did some research and found the Huawei mate SE, this phone has really impressed me and im very happy with it, i have been using it non stop and the battery life is incredible it can go three days on one charge using facebook,instagram,messenger and others without using battery saver mode
i have not not had any problems and im very happy with it"
B0791VS3N9,Teresa L Rosser,5,"I love this phone I only wish it was slightly wider and a full 6 inches instead of 5.93 other than that I really have no complaints. In fact, if at all possible, this is the only brand of phone that I will ever buy again. It has all of the bells and whistles of any of the higher priced phones (Samsung/apple in particular) and even better customization. Just the fact that you can have 64gb of internal memory for only 250.00...what is not to love."
B0791VS3N9,Patrick,5,"The phone has everything I need from a smartphone at a great price.
My only gripe is the speaker isn't great, but it works well enough, and for movies and music I just use headphones and thankfully there is a headphone jack for my daily driver headphones. Also USB-C would have been nice, but it's whatever.

Overall this phone is snappy, responsive, has a great finger print scanner and has suited all my needs so far.
Definitely recommend, especially at this price!"
B0791VS3N9,Alessio,5,"Love it!
What a phone. Works absolutely great out of the box.
I'm on T-mobile and if you select automatic mobile network it will work on 4G LTE with no issue whatsoever.
Comes with Android 7, but you can upgrade to 8 rigth away like I did and you're set.
Alluminium body, great back camera, decent front camera, amazing storage of 64gb and 4 gb ram.
Screen is top-notch and battery lasts for at least one day of power usage, two days if you use it lightly.
I'm impressed.
Huawei is the new way to go."
B0791VS3N9,Jennifer,5,"All I can say is wow. I really thought I'd be disappointed, but I was not. This phone is a great phone. It's fast and clear and I can hear. I haven't ever used it up to my ear to talk because I'm a headset person, but it works great with Bluetooth. I'm not sure that anyone should ever purchase a phone through their carrier when you can get a super high quality phone for a 1/2 of the price of a phone with similar specs through the carrier."
B0791VS3N9,marcos,5,I love this phone!! Us government doesn't like it because it can shut down their secret little running processes. I almost never loose battery power..I hate Google running my life Soo this phone takes care of that. I can get into settings that u normally can't in any other Android phone. For a serious technical person this phone is great. If not too techy stick with the smell of apples..thanks Huawei for standing up to the big dogs
B0791VS3N9,Ryan,5,Love this phone got the grey version and people won't stop telling me it looks and feels like an iPhone then I tell em what it is and it's much cheaper and they are shocked. Zero complaints so far super fast boots up with ease. Camera is good but with water shots it struggles a bit but nothing too bad. Can insert dual Sims but I have a 128 gig micro SD card in mine. It comes with emui 5.0 but there is an update to 9 right out of the box. Some people complain about the lack of a USb type c really I could care less it comes with microUSb. Bottom line is you can't beat this phone for the price
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I bought this for my wife and so far her and I love them. Best phone for price that I could find.The phone looks and feels like it costs $500-$800. Not as fast as the flagship phones but I can wait 1 second for screen to load instead of .5 seconds. Buy it you wont be disappointed.
B0791VS3N9,raffatic,2,"Bought this model due to it's terrific review. But very disappointed with it when after 10 hours on the charger, it was only 60% charged. Also it wasn't reading pics stored on my on my SD card. I think it's s great phone as it oerfirms flawlessly except the charge time and not reading the my pictures on my SD card which I installed from my old Samsung. Returned it for refund and purchased another brand."
B0791VS3N9,Holly,5,Love this phone. Works and feels as a high end phone. And I got such peace knowing I am not making payments for 2 years in a iPhone. Why waste your hard earned money. Some of my iPhones won't even update anymore. Great purchase .
B0791VS3N9,Jim,5,"Great phone. Bought for wife. She's had no complaints. Fast enough. Good storage amount with Microsd expansion available, which is harder to find. No alot of case options, but get one. Doal camera for portrait mode gives so-so results. Primary camera in standard mode is better. Fingerprint sensor is fast and handy. UI is fast and unobtrusive."
B0791VS3N9,Kaminari Katuhstrofik,2,"Over all good phone if you don't need it for navigation or Pokemon Go, etc etc. The GPS/antenna on this phone is straight garbage. Really disappointed in it."
B0791VS3N9,Z. Leeman,5,This is a really really good phone when you factor in the price point this phone is an amazing phone in my opinion is the best phone on the market well yes it might lack some of the high-end features of the iPhone x like facial recognition I gladly give that up for the $800 price time difference I cannot recommend this phone enough the screen has been Fantastic Four picture quality no scratches processor speeds fantastic hard drive space fantastic I've had this phone for over 2 months and I have had zero issues with it.
B0791VS3N9,Scott,4,"Never thought I would need it, but just started a job in a dead spot (AT&T service). The phone doesn't have Wifi calling...I never have needed it in the past many years / decade...

Also, for some reason, my phone and tablet has a problem loading ""weather.com"" but does fine everywhere else. Really weird...if I stop the browser and then refresh, it usually goes through. Other than these, pretty legit phone / tablet (Huawei MediaPad M5)"
B0791VS3N9,Tosin Ogunkoya,4,"I havent had any issues with the phone except the gps. I dont know if its not compatible with google maps or vice versa but it's so incredibly glitchy... It freezes, doesn't always orient to my location, and just sucks.

Pros:
- The camera is incredible!! Everyone always wants to use my phone for pictures.
- battery life lasts long time when in battery saver mode
- phone calls are fine"
B0791VS3N9,Lionel H,5,"Getting this phone setup and using it was non-eventful. It is fast and screen has bright image. Very easy to transfer my information from old phone using AT&T Mobile Transfer app. If this phone continues to work this well for a couple of years it will be the best I've owned. My original plan was to get the Samsung Galaxy S8 (old phone S5) but given price I gave the Huawei Mate SE a try. So far, I think it's great."
B0791VS3N9,Sadie1476,5,Fast shipping and packaged well! We love this phone! Bought it a few months ago and have had not one issue! Itâs been dropped and no scratches or breaks! Wasnât sure about ordering this brand and honestly have not one regret! Has a lot of space and ways to add so much more space. Also super easy to keep the storage cleaned out and battery last a long time! One of the best purchases we have made so far online!
B0791VS3N9,Jocelyn,4,"Just got the phone the other day, so far so good. Only giving it 4 stars because I haven't had it long so I can't write a super detailed review. Much faster than my old phone (blackview), holds a charge well, gets good service, I like the layout and the setup of the features. Great camera! That's a big selling point for me and the pictures come out great and it has some cool features to play with like stickers, manual camera settings and some great editing options. Optional additional storage is great too. So far I really like this phone and would definitely recommend it."
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,5,"This is a great phone! I know there has been some negative press about Huawei and even warnings. Not sure what all of that is about, but I have zero negative things to say about the phone. It is running Oreo and is fast, snappy! Picture quality is great. Video is great. I am really picky about phones and this one ticks all boxes! I use straight talk and added a 64gb card to it. If you are looking for a budget phone, not sure you can find a better one!"
B0791VS3N9,Don Pollard,5,I have had this phone for almost 3 weeks now and find it to be exceptional. It is the best phone I have ever owned. Picture and sound quality are superior. Reception and call quality are great either with or without my Blutooth headphones. The functionality and overall performance is on par with the most expensive cell phones available. I cannot believe it cost me less than 300 dollars and performs as well as any IPhone or top dollar Android device available. Well worth the money and I will remain a Huawei customer in the future.
B0791VS3N9,Sgreen_94303,5,"I bought this for my partner whose LG Stylo 3 was all smashed up. My partner loves this phone and so do I. We activated on Metro PCS which is basically T-Mobile. The phone has great specs, never lags, the camera is good with a lot of features I wish my Pixel XL has. I would rather have this phone that my Pixel XL. I'm really happy with this phone and it's performance. Huawei makes fantastic phones."
B0791VS3N9,Cling to the Gospel,5,"So I took the plunge and went for it. I also use Mint Mobile and the sim started working as soon as I put it in and restarted the phone. This thing seems to be awesome so far. Very solid phone, not the fastest processor I suppose but way faster than anything I have gotten from Metro PCS or Boost. The RAM is also its strongest point. Its amazing and the large screen with small bezzles allow me to read my kindle app with ease."
B0791VS3N9,David R.,4,"I would give this 5 stars but GPS is horrible. I have used programs to help but to no avail. I use my phone for tracking my business miles thru MileIQ and the phone just will not reliably track my driving miles with the GPS. Otherwise, its a great phone with awesome features for a basic user. I do not game and do not listen to music on my phone. But otherwise, a great little phone for the price. Gave up my Iphone for this and was not disappointed in the basics...only the one gripe about the GPS."
B0791VS3N9,El Pitufo Grunon,5,"Huawei continues to deliver high features at a fraction of Samsung or Apple. I needed another phone as my honor 5x was over 3 years old. I was still impressed with what my old handset could provide but outdated Android Software.

Which networks; Apparently no one can read the Amazon Description GSM: In Mu'rica T-Mobile or AT&T. I use Straight Talk AT&T no issues

Pros:
Metal Silver Case; looks sharp and included a outer protective sleave to protect the finish.
Finger Print recognizer is faster than my Honor 5X
Camera what an improvement. I'm taking less fuzzy pictures
Uploaded Huawei Themes; now it emulates icons similar to Samsung or Apple. Cool feature and free
Screen is beautiful and battery has lasted about as long as my old honor 5X throughout the day.

Struggles:
I had to reinstall the GMAIL app. Got hung up trying to sign in to multiple accounts.
Bluetooth seems to struggle on initial setup with headphones. Still pairing with vehicles will update.
No USB C. Slow charge like my older 5X

Overall I am impressed. I purchase my phones outright because I do not finance a phone for two years. Seriously, is that Phone X worth $999 that is made next door to the Huawei Chinese Factory for a quarter of the price?

Update:
Included Android 8.0 Oreo updated on the the west coast the best coast 11 May 2018 on a budget phone."
B0791VS3N9,Guesticide,5,Great phone for the value. Picture and battery life are fantastic. Sounds could be a bit better but it's not too horrible. Fast speeds and connects with Cricket Wireless with zero issues. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"Nice phone at any price and a super phone for $250.00. Once I found the transfer apps I got almost everything swapped over from my aging Samsung Galaxy. 64BG is lots nicer than having only 16GB memory, nice photos, pretty screen. The only problem so far is they won't ""pair"" with my hearing aids. I switched from AT&T to Consumer Cellular, happy there too."
B0791VS3N9,Taoufik Guerouate,4,"This phone was a huge surprise. Even the camera, that I thought wouldn't deliver, was very good enough to take good pictures. I, always thought, there is no excuse to buy a $800-$1000 phone in our time when you can get a decent phone for 1/4 of that price. What I didn't like is the EMUI (won't bother you) and also the unlocking of the device (you have to go through the swiping up). Overall, a great phone from people who know how to make a cheap phone for the working class."
B0791VS3N9,Johnny Ortiz,2,"I like the design the look
I love everything about this phone except that it does not work on Boost.
I called Huawei customer support and they said that at the moment it only works on the T-Mobile Network because the government is telling companies to not support this brand
I'm sorry Huawei but im gonna have to return this."
B0791VS3N9,Steven Irish,5,"The phone is top-notch. Plenty fast enough, the screen is sharp & the sound isn't terrible. The main camera is pretty good, the front facing camera is on par with other phone maker's offerings. Definitely got our money's worth with our purchase. We bought two, the wife got the white/gold one that is quite sharp. I got the other one, black/slate."
B0791VS3N9,Catherine L.,5,I love these phones. Huawei phones are wonderfuly priced and work amazing. This is my second one. I decided to upgrade a bit but I bought one for my mom and one for my dad they love them. My friends are jealous of how clear my screen is and how nice my pictures are.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I had been using a service provider smartphone before this. It had 8gb of storage and was slow beyond conparison. I have been very satisfied with this phone. It is sturdy, crisp, relatively light, thin enough, and for the price i cannot complain. In fact I have actively tried to convince others to get this if they were looking for a new phone. Huawei has its own version on android called EMUI 8.0. This version has a lot of neat features like in the camera app where you can take switch from multiple different modes to get what you want. All around it is a great phone. While i do not like what Huawei does with user information and i think it is terrible, for someone like me, i have nothing that is sensitive so it doesn't affect me. All around great phone, would and will recomend (and no i am not paid by Huawei to say these things, just a satisfied customer)"
B0791VS3N9,dustyman042004,4,Overall solid performer. Was nice to get an upgrade of the honor 7x in sense of ram and memory. Nice having cases out lwary for it although I would like to see a full body case for the with a attached screen protector. I would say it is safe to assume it will receive 8.0 Oreo like the 7x is supposed to. It is worth the value of what u get
B0791VS3N9,A-S Household,5,This is my phone I use now. I love it. It works well. I'm only 21 but I feel like 80 when it comes to new technology. This phone has a lot and bells and whistles that I don't use. But I think it's pretty cool.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"This phone works just as well, if not better than my iPhone 7plus. Itâs the exact same size. Itâs a beautiful phone and so far havenât had any issues running apps on it. Bought this as a gift for my daughter who needed a new device and I didnât want to spend $600+ on an iOS or Samsung phone. She plays ROBLOX and AJPW on it and it runs smoothly. We only use it on WiFi, no phone plan on it, but thereâs plenty of free messaging apps that can be used to text and make calls with other android and iOS devices. We love how fast the fingerprint ID technology works on it. I always have issues with my own iPhone. Totally worth the price!"
B0791VS3N9,h8,5,"Pros:
great screen
fingerprint sensor
great value
Powerful and with good storage

Cons:
Speaker quality is ok, but my moto g4 had a better sound
Not a stock Android rom, the interface is somewhat improved over the default android but it takes a day or two getting used to it.

Verdict:
I like this phone very much and recommend it."
B0791VS3N9,brad,5,"It is absolutely amazing phone for the price point. It has a nice display, it's fast, has plenty of storage, feels solid, and has Android Oreo. The camera works great in good lighting, but is the phones weak link. The rear camera struggles in low light and the front camera is decent. The bottom line is a better phone will cost at least double.This phone is better than my OnePlus 2 it replaced. Including the camera."
B0791VS3N9,Mark,5,Very nice very cheap (priced) why would you pay more. I purchased this for my wife but had an upgraded galaxy for myself I bought a while ago. Wish I had found this phone 6 months ago. I spent $400 for an Edge 7. I could have bought this for $250. I can see why some stores don't want to push this. Their lines would run dry with people purchasing the Huawei Mate SE. Too funny
B0791VS3N9,N.M,4,"Replaced a G5s which replaced a HTC 10.. The G5s is 3 months old.. This phone is better in my opinion than the g5s due to the fact that for the same price it has Android 8.... My HTC 10 was bought in Dec. 2016 and got 8 in January 2018...!!!

For the price range phone runs great.

Dont like the huawei bottom lock screen (i.e no slide right on bottom to unlock, brings up a MENU!) Still figuring out in themes how to change it."
B0791VS3N9,EVA,4,"I've had this phone just about a month and I'm really loving it. I like that I have more memory and storage as that was my primary reason to purchase. The battery life is good, the picture quality is good and the sound is OK. All features considered, I think it's a good buy."
B0791VS3N9,FashionStarr,5,"I LOVE this phone! Very nice in appearance. Got a refurb, but very gently used- looks and feels new. Some of the ""minor"" things that can irritate you with a phone are all taken care of...very pleased. Great system. My first Huawei, will definitely buy again from this company."
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,5,"Love this phone have had a couple months now and it's functioning as promised. It exceeds all my expectations. Good sound, awesome camera, great amount of storage for all my needs. Had a note 2 before and a honor 6 but finally ended up with this phone and it was a good fit for me."
B0791VS3N9,Romie,5,"I absolutely love this phone! Seriously.

My three most recent androids were Blu phones prior to this (all 3 failed after about a year and crashed a lot of the time and didn't consistently send texts) and was considering an Apple iPhone.

This phone completely exceeded my expectations. It is absolutely the best of any android phone I've ever used!

Fast, no crashes and good quality feel to it."
B0791VS3N9,Parvin,2,"I ordered 2 of used like new from amazon wearhours and I Can't believe that there is no inspection, I got 2 defective phones back to back, -soon as finish the setup got stuck in loop restart only way to stop it switch to recovery mode and wipe everything and start over, the same thing happened for the second time , thanks to Amazon solved the problem"
B0791VS3N9,John,4,"After quite a bit of research I decided to buy this phone even though I had obstacles such as AT&T deciding not to sell it then Best Buy doing the same. I came here, saw it, bought it and, after a few months in, am quite satisfied. No 5-star rating since it doesn't have OIS or NFC. The fact that it only has 2.4GHz WiFi isn't an issue. Who needs a $900 phone anyway?!"
B0791VS3N9,J. Sperling,5,"5 months later and this phone is the best phone I have ever owned, works like the day I bought it. For 230$ the phone feels like a luxery phone with it's metal body and doesn't feel lightweight like most cheap phones to. I never thought I would move away from Samsung, but Huawei blows Apple and Samsung out of the park. I also bought my fiance one for her birthday :)"
B0791VS3N9,Thomas Lund,4,"Had the phone for about a week. Works well, no problems. Very happy with the quality of the phone...

Update: have used the phone for about 2 month now. The only problem I have had is that it locks up for some reason and then it takes 2 to 5 minutes before it resets. I haven't messed with removing the battery and now that I know what happens I guess it's not a big deal. For under $200 it's a small thing to deal with."
B0791VS3N9,Mauri Andriani,5,"After 8 months of use I do not have any type of phone complaint. The life of the battery is very good, the phone works very well and never stays stuck. the camera is not the best of the phone but it works correctly. This phone will be with me for at least 4 years."
B0791VS3N9,W. Frush,5,"I got this phone for my wife. She uses it on T-Mobile. The sound is up to expectation for cell phones. The pictures are not as good as my Samsung smartphone generates, or my daughter's iPhone, but they're still OK.
We like the battery life - when running with a 4G signal, we can get almost two days of use between charge. The battery is quite good."
B0791VS3N9,Jan,4,"This phone has about everything I need. I'm not buying into all the Huawei spying crap that's going on so I'm very happy. The only thing I miss is gorilla glass, but for the price, it's understandable you can't have everything. I don't care it doesn't have NFC because it's a feature I don't use anyways. Charging is not the fastest either but it easily lasts a full day so night time charging solves that issue.
The phone makes pretty good quality pictures, not the best but more than acceptable. For great pictures, I still have my Nikon camera. Lots of storage (more than I need), enough RAM, fast enough CPU, bright screen... I'm a happy camper who's done with expensive Samsungs now."
B0791VS3N9,CoffTea,4,"Overall works great. I use USMobile as my carrier. Was able to transfer data from old phone no problem.
Cons:
Sound works fine but sometimes have a hard time hearing ring tone
No fun themes
Pros
Big screen
Fast connection n surfing
Lock screen options

Would recommend"
B0791VS3N9,Maribeth,5,"This phone in incredible. I have had it for about five months now, and it still works as well as it did when I first bought it.
Pros: Dual rear cameras, great picture quality, fast finger print response, navigates quickly through apps, large high quality screen, loads of storage
Cons: While the portrait mode is awesome 95% of the time, sometimes it gets wonky and focuses on random things in the background as well as the subject. This is literally the only con I can think of.

For the price point, this is probably the best phone on the market right now. I love it."
B0791VS3N9,J. Klaas,5,"I'm extremely impressed with this phone. After having two different iPhones and a Samsung galaxy through the years, the Huawei Mate SE is hands down the best smart phone I've owned. It easily has the best battery life and offers the same or better features for a fifth of the price of other phones. I've yet to have a single issue with it after almost one year. My battery when I go to bed is usually around 50%. I've never had to charge it during the day. The fingerprint sensor is amazing as well. I have no complaints. I kind of feel cheated after paying so much for iPhones and samsungs in the past."
B0791VS3N9,D'King,5,"This phone appears to outperform my Pixel XL for about 1/5 the cost. It replaced a defective LG 5 phone and there is no fair comparison between the two of them. Battery life is insane...at evening, battery power is still about 75%. It does everything exceptionally well. I highly recommend this phone at any price and for under $250? Wow! Nothing else can touch it!"
B0791VS3N9,A. Fisher,5,I only recently converted from a Nokia Windows phone to Android since I was tired of nothing being compatible. Tried a low-end Samsung first and was really disappointed--good screen definition but it was slow and I disliked the home button. I then decided to upgrade to the Huawei Mate SE instead and have been totally impressed. It's responsive for my needs. I enjoy the simplicity of the fingerprint button to unlock the phone. I'm not the most sophisticated smart phone user but I can confidently recommend this phone.
B0791VS3N9,Joe.c,5,"This is a great phone, the specs of this phone are great, for the money you are paying. I highly recommend this phone, what more could you want for less than 300 dollars great camera, great quality and great battery. Perfect for anyone looking for a great phone with out wasting 500 dollars. Also it has a 1 year warranty which is great!"
B0791VS3N9,George,4,"I had some trouble transferring data from my old phone to this new one. Most were unable to be transferred â¦ yes this is partially my fault for not keeping my backup current, but the fact that NO transfer programs were able to work with this phone was concerning. Otherwise, it is working fine and is a very nice midrange phone."
B0791VS3N9,Mag,5,Had it for a day and so far I'm blown away! I have been buying Huawei phones for a long time and they never disappoint. For the price it's a no brainer. I will update
B0791VS3N9,Jason George,4,"Actually a pretty good phone for the price. I was disappointed that Huawei stopped providing bootloader unlocks for these devices, but for what it is stock it's a good phone. Great camera and with an octocore processor it is very fast. Fingerprint sensor responds immediately and facelock was a cool feature too. I don't care for the speaker placement for playing games because holding this phone in landscape makes you cover it. Gaming is pretty good but I did expect better performance in 3D games. So far battery life is good to average although when this phone is in standby there is almost zero drain. Comes with a clear case which is cool till you get what you want."
B0791VS3N9,Larry Medema,1,"Do not buy this phone if you use Verizon for phone service. After much to do, this phone was found to be unusable on my Verizon contract. I wish Amazon would've noted that, Very disappointing."
B0791VS3N9,acron1,5,"... I got this in a pinch after my son dropped (and killed) his phone while away in college. He loves this phone. It looks great with metal finish, the screen is bright and clear, the sound is good and the pictures it takes are reasonably nice. Best of all it was delivered in a locker at SBU the very next day!"
B0791VS3N9,Nassim Jammal,5,"just received this phone and so far, really impressed with it. I came from an s6 and I am pleasantly surprised with this phone. I really don't care about the technology hype, this phone is fulfilling its task and more. I would definitely recommend it."
B0791VS3N9,HisBoyElroy,5,"Upgrade from a Honor 6X after dropping that phone and smashing the screen. I loved my old phone and this one is even better. Very snappy, wonderful build quality. Huawei makes the best phones for the money in my opinion."
B0791VS3N9,Hins H,5,"Nice phone, very fast, and the power is longer than others."
B0791VS3N9,K413B,5,"I have purchased many many unlocked phones, but this one is by far the best. The phone is fast, copies the good parts about iPhones, provides plenty of customization, and is speedy with very few hiccups.
For $250 , this phone is a steal."
B0791VS3N9,T. Yiu,4,"It has great spec, incredible value. The only thing I donât like is the micro usb charger port. Huawei Honor 8 introduced in 2016 already has usb c charger port.

Now the best part is the metal case. It is extremely light weight. IMHO, this is the one reason to get this phone. I own Huawei Honor 8 and it has a glass case. Most of the more expensive phones use either glass or crematic for the case. They are heavy and they break easily when you drop your phone accidentally. So you are paying more for expensive phones by having greater risks.

Am I a fan of Huaweiâs phones? Not yet. I own Huawei Honor 8 and its battery went bad in 11 months, So I will update the review of Mate SE a year from now.

In addition, for USA, Huawei 7X and Huawei Mate SE are similar but Mate SE is better.

US version Mate SE = International version of 7X

US version of 7X. = Trimmed spec of the international version of 7X"
B0791VS3N9,Jorge Cruz,5,"I love it, and for the price!!!!!! Great!!!!!!!!!!!!.....No contact or extra bills for an expensive phone that will do the same things this one will..."
B0791VS3N9,Lynne DeVos,5,"So far, I like the phone very much. My only complaint so far is, when I am finished with a call and bring the phone down in front of me, the screen is dark, so I can't hang up, with out pushing the button to turn the screen on. Otherwise very fast response time. Lots of space and memory."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon7690,5,"How beautiful, all huawei devices, they work better then anything on th market, plus they have so much hidden ââ-, would blow the your mind, Huawei love you"
B0791VS3N9,Brittany Barker,5,"I love this phone it is worth way more. It's a great buy and so much to the phone. Easy to use, a lot of memory, takes great pictures, has great sound, everything on it is perfect. I will say though I wasn't happy that it didn't come with a lot of stuff to protect the phone in the big box it was shipped in and also I had a deep scratch on the bottom of my screen that even when I put the screen protector on you can still see some of it."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Let me preface this by saying I never write reviews for Amazon purchase unless they really stand out. I bought this as an upgrade from a terribly slow (but also very cheap) smartphone - Blu 5.0 Advance. The difference is astounding. The call quality, speaker, and camera are great. The phone is very quick. I have no problems using apps like Snapchat without any lagging issues. Please note that this phone can only use nano sim cards (1 nano sim and a micro SD or 2 nano sims). If you're hesitating to buy, make the jump you won't regret it. I did a lot of research on phones under $300, and this is the best bang for your buck. Best purchase I've made in recent memory."
B0791VS3N9,Rich,3,"Is Huawei using this device to spy on me? Possibly.

Is Huawei using this device to give me accurate turn-by-turn directions? Nope."
B0791VS3N9,BuckJames,5,"I am very happy with my decision to purchase the Huawei Mate SE, very happy! I love how responsive it is to my commands, how I'm able to stream a movie and watch the movie without it having to buffer all the time. Nothing worse than interruption, right? The 4 gig of RAM allows me to actually multi-task on my Smart phone! Facial reconition and how about the fingerprint identification system that unlocks in a super sonic 0.2 seconds? Yeah, that's what i'm talkin about! Yeah, I'm pretty excited as you can tell and I could go on but I don't wanna bore you. Take my word, I'm 63 years young you should buy one too. I promise you won't be dissapointed.
Sincerely,
Buck James ""1955"""
B0791VS3N9,EGagne,5,"Loving it so far. Has a great feel from aluminum construction, tons of ram and storage and the battery is phenomenal. Can't recommend enough for a sub $300 phone. For context, I'm coming from a galaxy s5"
B0791VS3N9,Naomi R.,5,"I bought this phone because my iPhone 6 died after getting wet, and I didn't want to spend almost $700 (or whatever they're ridiculous prices are) for a new phone and a used one was almost $300.

So far I've had it for 3 months and have zero complaints. The screen resolution and size is great and the camera is on point. It takes better pictures than the iPhone in my opinion. I don't have a problem with WiFi and Bluetooth which I know some people complained about. I use them all the time at the same time and it works great. The battery life is also really great. It will usually last me about 1 1/2 days and sometimes 2 if I'm not on it a lot.

In all honesty the phone is great and the price is unbeatable."
B0791VS3N9,Diaoyu,5,"This is a very good phone for the price. I use it with a pre-paid carrier, and there was no problem in setting it up. For the routine usage of a smart phone, like calling, text messaging, taking pictures, and downloading/playing games, videos, music, and podcasts, it does its job. It is responsive and runs smoothly. No problem with different Wi-Fi connections. I do find the camera focusing function tricky, but I do not use this phone often for pictures."
B0791VS3N9,Moma,5,I could lower the cost using freedompop sim. I use Google hangout for talk instead of crap freedom pop app.
B0791VS3N9,Elissa,5,Love this phone. Purchased for my son but thinking of switching from my Samsung s6 to one for myself. Works well with Cricket wireless.
B0791VS3N9,Elijah walker,5,Nsa already gather data. Facebook sells our data to companies that don't necessarily have to American based. If your worried don't buy. But let me tell you this is one of the most well crafted fast sleek and optimized machines for modern day smart phones. Best believe I'm on a prepaid plan with one of the strongest quickest phones on the market.
B0791VS3N9,hellborndisease,5,"I've had the phone for a few hours, so far so good. I transferred my number from my old straight talk phone. Sadly is only supports GSM (I knew beforehand). I had to choose between using AT&T and t mobile chip that straight talk offers."
B0791VS3N9,Alex S.,5,"I upgraded to this phone from a Moto G5+. The battery life is REALLY nice, the screen is clear and beautiful, it has plenty of performance. The only negatives I have is that it doesn't do 5Ghz wifi, and it uses a micro-usb instead of type-c. Both are minor points that I can happily live with.

There is no better phone in this price range."
B0791VS3N9,Indigo,3,"Honestly, I'm still biased toward my old iPhone 6 and miss it, though unfortunately it's more expensive on my plan. This phone has a problem with viewing text messages, it jumps around and lags. The touch sensor on the back of the phone really only works to unlock it and not much else."
B0791VS3N9,Ben,5,"This is perhaps the best phone I have ever owned at a fraction of what I used to pay for Samsung, LG and iPhone.

It is fast and most importantly battery last 2 days with heavy use. If you don't mind no wifi calling, the this the phone to have. You can't go wrong with that price."
B0791VS3N9,Rdrunner22000,5,"Very nice phone,fast,not much to choose from in a case for it.not much in choice of screen glass(a good one that is),phone is great.just can't figure out where sd card goes to expand memory.not much instruction included in sealed box pertaining to that.i have it running on straight talk.works perfect"
B0791VS3N9,Mohiuddin Ahmad,5,"1. Super fast processor
2. super fast fingerprint sensor
3. High resolution, 2k
4. Good camera
5. Huge storage
6. Very cheap compared to parallel phones"
B0791VS3N9,Sid,4,"The minus 1 star is mainly for the shipping. There was no packaging in the shipping box so the contents were moving around inside. For a delicate device like this I'd have expected better considerations. Thankfully the phone seems to have survived anything that might have befell it.

I'm upgrading from a Galaxy S5 so this is a major overall improvement for me. Thought I'd give another brand a try.
The features are as described. For the price this is not bad. I paid $300 for my S5 back in 2015 and the Mate SE is less than that.... I'll definitely consider upgrading with this brand later on if the Mate SE does a good Job."
B0791VS3N9,Kitty,2,"I loved this phone .. but will save and buy another ..It constantly makes calls by itself.
I had first thought it was something I was doing ..but...it can be in my purse or just next to me....The speaker phone also does not work....With all the wonderful reviews I guess I just got a lemon"
B0791VS3N9,bar k,5,"only 3 cons #1 not enough customization with emui user interface. downloaded nova launcher
#2 no usb c #3 branding on the front. none of which takes a full star away. maybe half a star. everything else is a pro, phone is fast,great screen, metal back and came with a tpu clear case"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"After trying one of these phones I bought two more for people in our office. For the first four months the phone was great, now all of us have different problems with the OS not communicating with the phone. In my phone the setting will say Mobile Data is turned on, along with roaming, and enabled 4GLTE. Yet When i go to use the an internet dependent application they are not working because I am offline. I will restart the phone and the applications will work again for a period of time.
Overall it is a well constructed phone, but everyone of us is having problems with how the phone interacts with the operating system."
B0791VS3N9,Plix,4,"great phone for the price. way faster than my old honor 6x. This Mate Se has extra 1gb ram and 64gb storage. Definitely well worth the extra few bucks over the honor 7x. The old 6x was laggy and freezes. So far no problems with this mate yet. the only complain i have is the video. Pictures are nice, but video not as sharp as my old iphone 6."
B0791VS3N9,Bru,5,"I'm absolutely delighted by this phone, as of the price and its specs, you won't get better deal other than this. My previous phone was also Huawei, it worked perfectly fine. Highly recommend this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Gabrielle,5,"So I've had this phone for six months now the quality is great pictures come out great it has lots of space but for some reason my headphone jack doesn't work well . I plug them in and the music just plays out loud. Gave me a reason to buy blutooth headphones though
Also this phone no matter how much i dropped it never cracked. unfortunately yesturday i had a fit of rage slammed it to the floor and stomped on it over and over again. Of course its ruined and i feel like a complete idiot but ive already purchased a new one and am working on my anger issues.
Dont stomp on your phone guys"
B0791VS3N9,Kevin,5,"This phone is a freak of technology for the price point! I ordered on a Friday and received it on Sunday! Unboxed it, immidiately did the system update and been zipping and zooming ever since! It's lightning fast, the camera is amazing and the Battery is outstanding! I watched Netflix for 4hrs straight and still had 70%. The finger print and facial recognition response time is pheonominal! The only negative thing I can relatively find to say about this phone is that I have a hard time with some of my wireless Bluetooth headphones but other then that, if you want a Galaxy Quality phone for $250 this phone is your answer!"
B0791VS3N9,Laura,4,This is a pretty decent phone. No issues I almost have it 1 year
B0791VS3N9,Shell,2,Ok phone has issues and bugs
B0791VS3N9,RRHeerens,5,The Huawei works very well for me. Used it in Europe with local inexpensive sim card and it worked like a charm. Now use it at home with my current carrier (Freedom). Very happy with the purchase and I'm staying away form the big brands and their crazy price swings.
B0791VS3N9,Dina,5,"I love the camera on this phone. I don't know much about technology but this phone is awesome for the price. I use YouTube, Netflix, WhatsApp and many other apps on this phone and it has never slowed down. The battery life is awesome too."
B0791VS3N9,Marck Houston,1,The heads of six U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies told the Senate Intelligence Committee this week that they could not recommend that U.S. residents buy Huawei products. The implication of this very public warning is that the Chinese brands pose a risk to national security â and possibly to consumer security as well. I returned this phone and no one should even touch Huawei with a barge pole.
B0791VS3N9,Gene Arrow,5,"Great phone so far. This one I got for my brother and he loves it. I have been using Honor 8 for two years and I didn't have even one issue with it. That's why we decided to get another Huawei phone. This one looks very solid, bigger screen, faster and you cannot beat the price. I always wonder why people pay nowadays $1000 if you can get a better phone for just under $300, plus unlocked???"
B0791VS3N9,Rich S.,5,"I've had this phone for about six months and I use it heavily every day for work and play... Is been Absolutely flawless!!

The touch screen had EXCELLENT responsive, the screen is large and very clear, the phone is Fast with a 2.36G octa core CPU, 4 gigs of RAM and 64G of storage.
Apps open usually in a second or less, web surfing also loads pages in less than a second most of the time. Phone switches beautifully between WiFi and cellular data, the camera takes excellent pictures with it's dual rear cameras and even the front facing selfie cam with basic built in beautify options work well.

The screen has an excellent built in coating that makes your finger slide over the glass very easy and it almost never builds up fingerprints, but when it does, just wiping it on my shirt cleans them off almost completely.

I have scores of apps on the phone and there are no conflicts with any of them, even lesser known apps work great as well as the bigger ones like Twitter, Skype, Facebook etc.

The battery life is very, very good as I rarely have to charge it more than once a day even using it for 7-10 hours a day with videos, movies, being on the phone for sometimes a couple of hours a day for work etc. It's 3385MAH battery works excellent.

The fingerprint scanner is BETTER than on my Samsung Galaxy, BLU and LG phone to, though the LG is second best. Just touching even a part of my finger to the sensor opens up the apps or unlocks the phone.

While the phone does NOT have an encrypted file system, which I really wish it did, it does come with a built in encrypted file safe for photos, documents, music or anything else you want to put in it.

It also has a built in app protector so that no app can be accessed without either the password or your fingerprint which again works within a third of a second every time. I like this as I'm very big on security.

So far I've gotten numerous updates from Blu including updating to Android 8.0 and many security updates.

I had an issue with certain apps and I contacted their online customer service via the chat feature. I got someone within 30 seconds and unlike most customer service who give you basic bs answers or stock answers, they understood the problem right away, which was not related to an issue with the phone but was a problem with the latest version of Google play store. Once they told me to remove it and download it again, the problem disappeared right away never to return.

Even though I have a good case in the phone, I've dropped the phone about 7 or 8 times and the phone still works great with no scratches on the screen at all.

I also like that the phone requires you to enter the password every three regardless for security reasons.

The phone call quality is absolutely beautiful and clear as it uses 4G for HD quality sound as good as my brothers $900 Galaxy 8. I've also NEVER had a dropped call even when being on conference calls of an hour or more and everyone sounds like they're right in the room with me. I also like that the phone has a built in Black list option to stop annoying spam calls which seems to be getting worse lately.

This is just an absolutely fantastic phone and several of my co workers have bought them after seeing my phone and hearing my praise of it. It's no wonder that Huawei sales have no SURPASSED APPLE to become the number twi phone seller in the world."
B0791VS3N9,Marc,4,"I was limping along with my Nexus 6P and it finally decided enough was enough. I wanted an interim phone to get me through to the next Pixel release and decided on this since my Huawei 6P lasted me 2.5 years which is a lot for an android device. I am very impressed with this phone. For the price it is quite feature rich. The system is crazy smooth. The storage is 64GB which is twice that of my 6P. Memory stands strong at 4GB. This is great as long as management of it stays on point. The camera is good. Not great but it is quite usable for a device at this price point.

Pros:
- 64GB storage
- 4GB Ram
- 6"" screen
- Works on Tmobile and AT&T LTE bands (no verizon or sprint)
- Crazy fast fingerprint reader in the CORRECT SPOT
- FM Radio and a headphone jack (common in Chinese phones)
- Good camera, but won't blow anyone away
- Dual SIM with great management tools
- Actual good battery life will get you through the day easy
- Slick all metal design, this is nice but also slippery. Luckily the phone comes with a free clear case. I bought the Spigen Honor 7X case though.
- $230???

Cons:
- Micro USB connection, better dig up your old cables
- No NFC, I use contactless payment a lot and this hurts
- No wireless charging, but this is a metal phone so eh
- EMUI skin is quite intrusive, I recommend Nova or Google Launcher on top, much better this way
- Only running Android 7.0, hopefully the Honor 7X beta program means Oreo will be coming to this device eventually, don't hold your breath though.
- This is a Chinese phone and these companies sometimes have questionable practices when using your personal data. Keep this in mind when buying lower end devices such as this. Probably doesn't matter though since your data is being harvested and sold by all phone manufacturers most likely. Might as well save a buck.

Overall I am very happy and impressed with this phone. Budget phones have come so far from the last time I had a lower end phone that I honestly did not expect this device to perform the way it is. This phone is easily worth the price. Micro USB being the biggest downfall of this device is understandable at this price point. This phone may get me to skip the new Pixel altogether! Buy this if you need something to hold you off until the next big thing OR if you are budget minded but still looking for a feature rich device.

**1 MONTH UPDATE**

This phone is still a great deal and I figured I would put a few more thoughts in this review since I have been using it for about a month. First the reason I am dropping this device to only 4 stars, battery management. This battery management is probably the opposite of what you think, it is TOO AGGRESSIVE. This phone has settings to kill what it considers ""power intensive apps"" when the device is locked and the screen is off. This option can be turned off which I have done, but it does not appear to be listening to me. The result of this is that I do not receive notifications for messages, smart things events, and many other things that I want to know as soon as they happen. Therefore I end up getting 3 or 4 notifications when I unlock the device. I have white listed all the apps that I want to continue running but the phone does not care. This is pretty annoying so I may end up rooting the device to remove EMUI.

The second annoyance I have found is that the phone does not allow you to set specific notification sounds per app. You get ONE notification noise for ALL your notifications. That sucks pretty hard. But, per my previous point, the phone doesn't tell you when you have notifications anyway so whatever I suppose.

The other notable point is that this device DID receive an Android Oreo update. This is great and unexpected on a budget device so I am happy to be on this later version of Android. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to save them from dropping a star.

Still a great device! Hopefully I can figure out a workaround for the battery optimization that kills your apps."
B0791VS3N9,larry b,4,"I did try the finger print ,it,s ok i guess but i did not like it as i have big hands and i did not really like it.so i tryed the password thing and you guess it a pain .over all the phone is easy to hear well talking.easy to hold with a new cover.i bought a black plastic rubber one.i,m sure glad i did not half to work two weeks to pay for my phone ."
B0791VS3N9,Ken,4,"This is one quality phone. It is a much better phone than the one I had before (LG). I've only had the phone for under 2 months and its working fine so far. Only a small issue with notifications. It seems notices can occasionally get delayed. Apparently according to my research, this is due to the EMUI's aggressive battery savings setting. Don't know for a fact if that's true. So far, I have not missed any important notifications (only delayed)."
B0791VS3N9,Brooke,3,"The Product is very vibrant and fast with lots and lots of storage however, the camera just wasn't what I was expecting, its not crisp it overcompensates by over sharpening photos. To put it in perspective the iphone 6 camera is much better."
B0791VS3N9,JosÃ© BolaÃ±os,5,"Amazing. Honestly I love this phone. Bought it to use it as a replacement for my Xperia XZ, for a budget device it has everything you'll need and more. Love the hardware, love the screen, love the battery, that camera it's just ok, it has micro usb not USB type C (me), downfiring speakers (bummer) but besides those things I can't complain."
B0791VS3N9,Homina homina homina,5,"I have had the phone for about 2 weeks. So far it has been good to me. I am pretty happy with it. I will comment more as time goes.

September 18, 2018: after using the phone for a couple of months, l love it! l just bought another one with a price even cheaper for my son. You cannot go wrong with this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Jeff C.,5,"WOW This is an excellent phone with great functionality beautiful screen and easy to maneuver, no bloatware - unlocked.
I refuse to buy an iphone and I am totally pleased with this phone , very fast processor smooth performance and nice battery life for all day events."
B0791VS3N9,Sam W.,4,"this phone is great, the screen resolution is not as good as the high end phones, but what do you expect. it's a $200 some what dollar phone, but it match up to the med range phones. purchased it for my nephew and he love it. it runs his game just fine."
B0791VS3N9,burwof,5,"Two weeks into using and am in love with how it works, smooth and fast. I forgot to add it was $229.00 when I looked at it, a week later I went to buy it and it was $20.00 more, then a week later it was back down to $229.00, was not happy and called Amazon and they said, more or less, tough luck."
B0791VS3N9,gordon,5,"Bought this for my daughter whose Oneplus 3T died. She loves the phone. It is quick, very attractive and has excellent specs. The price point is unbeatable. This is one of 7 Huawei/Honor phones my family uses. We are all very happy with them. I don't think you can beat it at this price point."
B0791VS3N9,A. Chustz,5,"Love it so far. If this Mate SE lasts, it is a great value. I will make it a point to re-post on this if it fails. Just like the S9. I am very happy. Fast, 4k, and lots of everything. Work perfect with AT&T service and has all the""AMERICAN"" settings and APPs."
B0791VS3N9,H. Timmons,2,"I've been using this phone for 3 months. It was fine at first. Happy with the cost, storage, speed. Phone calls are fine, had to buy a customizable messaging app because the built in Messaging is terrible. Issues with app compatibility are growing every week. I am not sure if it's an Android, Google, or Huawei issue but it's getting very annoying. The Google location tracking doesn't stay up to date, keeps telling me it's off, timeline doesn't show where I've been or when. Multiple issues with connectivity on Bluetooth. My music app has decided to play my notification sound between every track, cannot resolve! It's like this phone has a mind of its own. Will go back to a Google phone as soon as I can afford it. Hassles are not worth the savings to me."
B0791VS3N9,jason,5,Galaxy killer........this phone is amazing...well worth the coins....super fast and comes with anti virus preinstalled...... cameras are Rock solid.....I dig the fact you can zoom your videos to full screen....they even have laptops from this company....good job Huawei
B0791VS3N9,Kargel,5,"Love this phone!!! I was awaiting the oneplus 6 but when it took too long to launch, I decided on a more affordable phone. I have no regrets. Phone looks and feels good. It has a few problems when I'm typing too fast and the key pad is slow to respond but besides that, I can't complain. I love the finger print unlock as well. Still loving this phone!!! I was very pleased with my purchase. I got more than I bargained for."
B0791VS3N9,Naga,1,"It's just 2G network compatible, it is not detecting my 5G network SSID."
B0791VS3N9,Monee,4,This phone is very economical and yet it feels and works like an expensive phone like a Samsung flagship or even an iPhone. The build is quality and so is the screen. The phone is not a slouch by any means and it takes the best budget I have ever purchased. The screen resolution does not have the Oled screen that I love with Samsung but it still has a beautiful screen. All in all this is a good buy for someone wanting a quality phone for a fraction of the price.
B0791VS3N9,Bear,5,"Amazing phone for the value. With 4GB of Ram, I have yet to encounter any issues with the system slowing down, or overheating. The screen is bright and vibrant with great contrast. I love the night mode where it dampens the colors to not strain your eyes at night. The battery will give you a full day of use, easy. The cameras are top notch, with a show motion video option that's actually pretty cool. The only downside to this phone is it uses a micro USB, not a type C. So there's no quick charge option. But other than that. It's a great phone."
B0791VS3N9,Taryn Morgan,4,"So I finally got my phone connected to Metro PCS the reviews are correct, so far the phone works amazingly and it's super fast. I'm taking a trip to California and this phone will be put to the test. Oh and one other positive the reviews say it doesn't have expandable memory but it does."
B0791VS3N9,douglas martin,5,"This is a beautiful phone for the price. It's fast and has a great fingerprint sensor. The only thing is I'm not sold on the 18/9 screen. My Sony Xperia xa Ultra has a 16/9 and just looks like a much bigger screen ( even though the Huawei is only slightly smaller)when watching videos. I know this is the new thing, but new isn't always better. So if your just a fad junkie ( hopefully this is just a fad) this will be your cup of tea. Why phone companies are always changing things that aren't broke, like removable batteries, headphone jacks, need to have a Sim ejector tool just to remove your SD card. I blame these changes on Samsung and Apple, all the other phone companies are just followers. Back to the phone - if you like the 18/9 and don't want to pay a fortune for a phone with a nice screen, great fingerprint reader, and decent camera and battery life this is the phone for you."
B0791VS3N9,Nick Raushenbush,5,"Wow. Canât belive a phone this inexpensive can be this good. Bought it as a travel phone backup, but may switch to Android over this. Keep in mind wonât work for Verizon and there is some USA controversy over the manufacture, which seems unwarranted, but the quality of this phone at this price is just incredibly impressive."
B0791VS3N9,Tab,3,"I love this brand and this phone. The camera wasn't as good as what I am used to so I returned it. I have an lg v20 & an lg v10. I loved EMUI also. I must say that i miss the unique features of this phone such as the screen recorder and scrolling screenshot built right in. I haven't found anything in the appstore that gives me these features without a headache. The phone itself was premium build and had an excellent UI that worked flawlessly with google. My lg's won't use Google's ""routines"" properly. I didn't have this problem on the Mate SE. If the camera isnt a huge deal, then you'll love this phone. I give the camera a 6 out of 10 but the phone a 9 out of 10. This is bc of the awesome UI and the ease of updates. My lg phones never get updates EVER."
B0791VS3N9,Phil Martin,5,"Absolutely stunning looks and performance for the price! Mine automatically updated to Android 8 and switching on and ported across all my ""Google"" data with no problems. Why pay $000,s when you can get similar performance and specifications for less than $250?"
B0791VS3N9,Karl D.,5,"There is only one issue that I have with the phone. When I turn on and my screen brightness is set lower than max it starts out bright then immediately adjusts to the lower setting. Everything else is perfect. Beautiful phone, great weight, fast, excellent picture and sound quality. The wife is silently envious"
B0791VS3N9,Reinaldo Gibert,5,"It's a great budget phone. Something I love from the Chinese phone is that the user interface, the applications that run on it are very well designed, something that for example Samsung does not. What we can do in these phones with their native applications can be achieved in Samsung phones by installing third-party applications."
B0791VS3N9,Chey,4,"I like it so far but a lot of space on the phone was already taken up by the system and preset apps which was very annoying. Otherwise it's a solid phone so far.

Update:
I have had this phone for almost a year now, and I am pretty happy with my purchase. There are a few issues, but they are minor issues the most people have with technology, such has apps freezing etc. I had these same issues when I had higher end Samsung products, so I expected as much from this phone."
B0791VS3N9,JJL,5,"compared to iphone 6s, just a tiny bit slower. Face and fingerprint recognition are lightning fast. Very light and thin. Picture quality is excellent. sound and speaker mode for calls are nice and crisp. I use it with a tracfone micro sd card. no issue to report."
B0791VS3N9,jthein01,5,Had the phone for over a month now and absolutely no complaints. As long as the Chinese gov't doesn't start spying on me I should be good.
B0791VS3N9,Carolyn walker,4,"Iâve had this phone since August .I Love the phone. before I made the purchase I read quite a few reviews.since Iâm not tech savvy & I only talk & text, look at Facebook very minimal things with the phone I decided to purchase it. I like that I can call Huawei theyâve been very helpfull. Now Iâve noticed that some pictures Iâve taking on vacation are all missing . I have peopleâs names & phone #âs in my contacts that when they call it shows up unknown. Iâm not understanding this at all. Has anyone else come across this issue. I will be calling Huawei again regarding this issue again."
B0791VS3N9,Priya,4,"This phone is something I needed to buy because my last phone got water damage. It was very affordable. However, I was going to switch form AT&T to Verizon, but the phone is NOT Verizon. Just letting you guys know before you buy and have Verizon. Besides this slight hiccup, phone is great."
B0791VS3N9,yolanda,3,Just recieved phone and took it to metro pcs only to find out that it is not compatible. Confused because every review has stated the phone is compatible?
B0791VS3N9,J. F. Olsen,5,"An awesome cell phone!!!. I'm thinking that Apple & Samsung & LG are terrified of the Huawei company....and especially Apple.
Doing everything they can to keep Huawei OUT of the mainstream USA marketplace. Millions of Chinese citizens are 'rockin out' w/ their Huawei phones and loving it!! This is the BEST cell phn I've ever owned. @ $250.....??? Are you kidding?? You will not regret buying this phone."
B0791VS3N9,II,3,"I really liked this phone at first. Then I discovered poor Bluetooth quality (connects to my car fine, then disconnects on its own, music playback with stuttering). On day two, it reset all my settings back to default. Then all notifications sounds stopped working, phone went into silent mode on its own. This would be a great budget phone if it wasn't for the problems above. Good reception on T-Mobile though. LTE+ 4g no problem whatsoever. Maybe it's just the phone I got, personally I don't want to deal with exchanges and product support stuff. Back to Huawei it goes."
B0791VS3N9,J.Pilot,5,"Don't spend more than you have to.
This will do everything you need at a fraction of the price.
I just love this phone & Incredible overall value!
Just don't expect an Iphone Camera at this price range.
Camera is Okayish... otherwise perfect"
B0791VS3N9,Maven Shopper,4,"I've had this for at least a month. I really like it. Since so many parts of phones, etc. are made in China I thought I'd take a chance. It has a lot of things that you can customize as well as features other Android phones didn't have."
B0791VS3N9,Big_jissum,2,"Too soon to tell upgraded from Moto 5 or 4 has more features than the Moto had to buy a case because it feels them other than that it seems okay for a cheap phone

Updated...had phone for 2 weeks and the battery wouldn't take a charge."
B0791VS3N9,Tim K,5,Has a lot of great features. Super fast. Updated to Oreo as soon as I turned it on. Have not had to reboot it once since I got it. Fingerprint scanner is super quick and reliable. Facial recognition works well too. Battery life is amazing. I can go all day constantly browsing Facebook and whatever and when I get home in the evening it still has 70+% battery life left.
B0791VS3N9,Rico,5,The phone worked perfectly with ATT 4G LTE speeds and it looks amazing. The sound quality wasn't the absolute greatest but I was also switching phones from an HTC M9 which has unbelievable sound so I can't complain. Looks and feels great in the hands. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Waaayyy better than paying $700+ for a new phone.
B0791VS3N9,D. E. Hollenbeck,5,"So far love this phone. Fast, smooth and feels great. Glad I got it."
B0791VS3N9,hafnon,3,I don't like that it doesn't support ac wireless standards. It works well in everything else.
B0791VS3N9,MotherofthePride,5,This phone is amazing! Especially for the price (it's almost unreal). So happy with this purchase!
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Thank you amazon finally i got my choice and good quality phone. This item works every thing great fast super smart i love HAUWAI mate.
B0791VS3N9,Review,5,"I purchase this phone . Because this phone is beyond any expectations I had for a smartphone and available for an incredible price .This phone has everything I needed .Dual sim card or micro sd card allows two phone number or unlimited storage , massive screen larger than 1080 HD ,decent camera good loud speaker fast fingerprint ID.One thing is this phone only support 2.4 GHZ wifi not 5 GHZ wifi . but overall this phone is good."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,"It is just ok. Looks great. Fingerprint reader is lightning fast (much, much faster than Moto G4 Plus) - didn't realize my G4 was slow until trying this. Unfortunately fingerprint reader is on the back (I know this is the trend, but don't like hunting for something I can't see. Bothered me more than I thought it would)

However, response time for starting and switching apps is no faster than my Moto G4 Plus (about the same) and the wifi speed is significantly slower (about 20%) than my Moto G4 Plus (side to side comparision with speedtest). Touch sensitivity is also worse - typing always results in missing characters. The worst thing about this phone is the sound quality. It is absolutely terrible from the internal speaker and also over headsets. I would guess maybe the internal speaker's poor quality is the price for the slim design. Was also inconsistent on Android Auto - sound quality was really, really bad on Android Auto until I found a tip online that said to turn off the 'special effects' from the sound settings (this fixed the problem). Also, not a big fan of EMUI (the customized version of Android), prefer the closer to stock Android experience of the Moto phones.

I returned it. Will wait for Moto G6."
B0791VS3N9,W Grimmer,5,"So far so good with this budget smartphone. A lot of people call this the King of the Budget Smartphones...I must agree.

I'm nitpicking, but here are a few suggestions that would make this phone perfect and probably $50-$75 more expensive, but I would still buy it.
1. Type C USB for charging
2. Dual Band Wifi (AC). Lacking this is a real bummer when a $40 Moto e4 at Walmart at least has dual band wifi
3. This phone only has LTE and would be better with LTE-A
4. fast/turbo charging
5. any type of water resistant rating
6. Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) But Google Photos (the android app version) does a pretty good job of fixing the shaky videos (after you shoot your shaky video)

Overall the phone is Really good and very well priced. And the battery lasts a Long Time! I am coming from a Moto X Pure (2015) edition and the Mate SE battery is 1000x better than my older Moto.

I also purchased the Honor View 10 to compare to the Huawei Mate SE. I know the View 10 has a better processor, more gigs of RAM (6 compared to 4) and double the internal storage, plus other features too...but when comparing them side to side, I don't notice a difference (i.e. speed or lagging) when using daily apps. When I use the Mate SE as a hotspot for my laptop, it is usually as fast as the View 10. I actually now prefer the fingerprint sensor on the back of the Mate SE better than the front of the Honor View 10. Using the sensor on the back seems easier and more comfortable than I ever thought it would.

So I don't think the View 10 is worth 2x the price of the Mate SE.

The Huawei Mate SE is a great budget phone that I am using as my daily phone now. I'm surprised at how much I like it, I did not think that would be the case. And it is not too expensive that I won't be upset replacing it within a year to 18 months with another newer budget phone. It will be interesting to see if Mate SE will still be as fast as it is now in 12 months."
B0791VS3N9,Stan Slieter,5,Upgrade from honor 5. Simple data transfer. Fast fast phone!! Polital govt. Hysterics on Chinese ties seems absurd given that nearly all our phones are made there.
B0791VS3N9,Andrew Raymond,5,Bought this phone to give to my wife so she could give her sister her old (but solid) Honor 6x. Where on day to and not much complaint from her except I noticed it got a bit hot the other day. Will update if I notice this to be a patter or something else show undesirable.
B0791VS3N9,care,5,"I was so scared not to buy another samsung but the reviews convinced me,so glad I did, so far the only negative I can think of it is not quite as loud as my note 4 ok for me but couldn't pass it on to my husband he is hard of hearing"
B0791VS3N9,J.E. Brand,1,"My phone was working great, but then today I woke up to it dead even though I had it charged it in all night. I have tried multiple outlets, multiple chargers. It won't charge. I can't return it because it became non-returnable two days ago. I can't force reboot since it's already dead."
B0791VS3N9,(((d(-_-)b))),5,This is my first international phone and I love it. Did my research before I bought it and I am satisfied. I normally would shoot for a Samsung Note but for this price could not resist to try and well worth the purchase.
B0791VS3N9,G Daniel,5,Moved up from Honor 5. Still a decent size if I need to put it in my pocket. Bit more user friendly than the 5- this works well with my Fitbit. Still doesn't do gifs or such but I'll live. Really happy to have storage card like Honor 5 did.
B0791VS3N9,sgub,5,"After 2 months, I'm still in love with this phone. I love the graphics of this phone, the available memory and the speed of the processor. But the best part was that I accidentally submerged this phone fully in water for several minutes and it still works great! And the fingerprint sensor on the back is perfect for getting into my phone quickly! I've had high end and low end phones and by far this is my favorite phone I've ever had."
B0791VS3N9,M Robinson,5,"Just installed Oreo 8.0,,,bonza! Best phone bang for the buck, speedy with great screen resolution. Used to be iPhone bloke, no more!"
B0791VS3N9,Dick Dahn,5,"I have a Huawei mate 9 and this compares very favorable to a phone that cost several hundred dollars more. Some of the features are slightly down scale, but the quality is generally outstanding. Bought this to have a a cheap second phone and it turns out only the price is cheap. Highly recommend it."
B0791VS3N9,Nate,5,"I have not one bad thing to say about this phone. I wasn't familiar with the company and I usually don't buy brands I don't know, but I was desperate for a new phone and this was a pretty good price! It's fast, the screen is super clear, and the camera is great! It's a wonderful phone for a really good price!"
B0791VS3N9,P. Viola,5,"This is my second Huawei. It's a very nice phone even vs my corporate Samsung 8 it's a game changer. No comparisons at this price point for an unlocked phone.

The only company is the speaker is small."
B0791VS3N9,D. Leach,5,Very happy with this phone. Previously owned a Blu Vivo XL2 and there is no comparison.
B0791VS3N9,Emma,4,"I just got this phone on Monday. With the quality of material, features and speed, this price point is unbeatable. Also, I went almost 36 hours without charging it and I still had at least a quarter battery left. If you need a phone that is up for the task and doesn't need frequent charges, I can't recommend this enough.
I will say that the fingerprint sensor is kind of annoying, though. It won't recognize my pointer finger so I had to go in and add more fingerprints and even those being recognized is pretty hit or miss. But that might just be my device."
B0791VS3N9,Sunghwan Kim,5,It is really fantastic. I searched a lot before buying this phone. And all positive reviews are true!! There is no reason to hesitate to buy this phone.
B0791VS3N9,farrin landmesser,4,"Phone is great for your basic everyday functions such as calls, text, emails, youtube, social media such as facebook, Instagram,.Snapchat, Twitter etc. The camera is pretty good. Has a lot of different photo modes, filters & options. Overall phone graphics could be better. The battery life is exceptional!! I can go a day or two without charging it. The phone is also very durable. I've dropped mine numerous times & their was no damage done to the phone at all fortunately. The Speaker phone sounds somewhat low to me when I use it. Overall For $239 or $249. This is a great phone!"
B0791VS3N9,DustbowlDarlin,5,"Purchased 2 of these and I can't tell a difference in performance or quality between it or a flagship Samsung Galaxy phone. I'm tired of breaking a phone and getting stuck in payment plans for phones costing as much as a computer. This phone is amazing and I feel like I got a secret awesome phone for an amazing price and no one else knows! Im a huge phone gamer and this phone does not disappoint! The camera is amazing with amazing quality and the fingerprint reader is instant. You will not he disappointed if you get this phone. I slapped straight talk Sims in them and they work great.

Review Update December 2018:
Still using this phone and it's still amazing. No loss of speed, I never reach hitting memory cap, and camera is still superb. There are so many cases in the market for it now im never bored of my phone . I've dropped it several times and I was terrified I'd cracked the screen, but it's in perfect condition . A solid phone!"
B0791VS3N9,Zach Baumbarger,5,"This device is very fast and very smooth. Easily the best experience I've had on an Android device. This phone birngs you flagship level specs without breaking the bank. Don't let the price throw you off. There is no lag. Cameras are absolutely gorgeous. Fingerprint scanner is instant. And that 3340 mAh battery keeps you charged all day, even under decently heavy use. That Kirin 659 Octa-Core CPU can handle everything you throw at it with incredible speed and realibility. The onboard EMUI is very responsive with no lag. Currently Android 7.0 out of the box with 8.0 on the way. Do not hesitate another second. But this phone. You will NOT be disappointed!!"
B0791VS3N9,Javier petit de meurville,5,"I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. Have a great camera, a great processor and plenty of memory. Great quality for the price!"
B0791VS3N9,Itzamna Ernesto Calderon,5,"I really like this phone way faster than the Galaxy for sure , the signal still sucks but that's because AT&T just sucks, but the phone is really good, screen has a good size and good resolution 4Gb in ram and 64Gb in memory it makes it even better , totally recommend this phone"
B0791VS3N9,Kindred420,5,"For $200, this phone is a no brainer! I was a lifelong Apple customer, but those days are over."
B0791VS3N9,Ivelin K,5,"We bought this phone four and a half months ago. The ratio price / quality is sooo good so two weeks ago without any hesitation, we bought a second one. The phone so far works amazing. It is fast, very good screen quality, the battery is lasting for the entire day, very good picture quality ( not the best). Amazing low budget phone."
B0791VS3N9,Albert Hammock,5,"Charged phone up and installed my sim card. Followed the step by step instructions for set up and it was a breeze. Downloaded phone clone, from app store, onto my old phone and was able to transfer all my apps, contacts, photos, and text message history. Very pleased with this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Alfonse,5,"I bought the 64gb version; it came with more free space than I was expecting from a phone, always nice. It doesn't have the Facebook app pre-installed; a bonus for myself, as when a phone comes with it already built in, you can't uninstall it.

I purchased this along with the other recommended items. The phone itself already came with a clear case, so I ended up with an extra case. I had no problems with my SIM card; inserted it into the Huawei and it was ready to go."
B0791VS3N9,Princesa,5,"My husband loves his new phone. He is particularly happy about the large screen, decent camera, and most importantly, the extended battery life. I believe he can go up to 2 days without charging it."
B0791VS3N9,Bryan M Chue,5,I'm tired of spending so much money every year or so on phone uupgrade. After searching for a while this is the best bargain you can get with these specs for a low price. Good battery life. Screen is clear and sound is good.
B0791VS3N9,Lisa Williams,5,This is the perfect budget friendly phone. Stylish and sleek. A few people saw it and at first look think it's an iPhone. Picture quality 4/5. Excellent battery life. Overall impressive and worth the buy!
B0791VS3N9,Julie,5,"This phone has lots of the features of even the newest i-phones, but at a much better price."
B0791VS3N9,Tarquin,5,The only downsides for me are lack of 5GHz WiFi and the main camera is only average. This is an excellent mid-range phone for a budget price. Excellent battery life. And it even includes a skin case.
B0791VS3N9,RR,5,Really please with the performance of this phone. Nice display with no lag. Battery life is amazing. Better than some of the high priced flag ship phones. I have a Samsung S9+ and this beats it for battery life hands down.
B0791VS3N9,John,5,"After one month, I couldn't be happier. Outperforms the iphone 8 at about 1/3 the price. The only downside is that it doesn't have wireless charging, but given the 3,000 vs 1,821 mah battery, its a moot point."
B0791VS3N9,Smilzbug,5,This is a great phone for the money. It has a very good processor that works flawlessly.
B0791VS3N9,Mauro Pellegrini,5,"Mate SE is an excellent cell phone at a very affordable price. It feels very solid, and look great. The screen has a very good resolution; the battery lasts almost two days with regular use. Then it was updated to Android 8.0. My son loves it."
B0791VS3N9,Mo,5,"This is our second purchase. The first one was bought in July and I'm happy with the speed, camera quality, and battery time. Plus, the phone is not heavy, and it came with a protective case."
B0791VS3N9,Ultralight Packrat,4,"Great device but the one thing that bothers me is that I usually keep tape on my phone cameras to prevent unwanted use, however I cannot do that with this phone as it will refuse to unlock unless the camera and speaker are unobstructed. Admittedly this makes me a bit uncomfortable with the device but aside from that it is a fantastic phone"
B0791VS3N9,Rudolf Stock,1,"I was very pleased with functionality, look and battery. My satisfaction went down the drain when I dropped my phone 3 ft on wood floor. AND protection on ! Screen blew in a million pieces..price to repair $120 . I had a BlackBerry before, was not too pleased with the functionality and that is why I changed to this model. What a costly mistake. I have dropped my BlackBerry a dozen times and it survived without a scratch. This Huawei Mate should be labeled : only use indoors on thick carpet floors."
B0791VS3N9,Dhanush Reddy,4,All over its a solid phone. I am bit disappointed with the front and back camera quality. They could have increased the cost of phone by another 50 bucks and added a decent camera.
B0791VS3N9,Kevin Garcia,5,So freaking this phone has been great. Really fast has not lagged or frozen one bit. I wish it had USB typ C charging but still charges decently fast. Battery life if GREAT I'm on it most of th day and does NOT drain the battery fast like my prior phone!
B0791VS3N9,lobo012847,5,"This phone was just received and set up. (WE can't get the touch to work, but will continue trying). The phone seems solid and has most of the features that phones costing 2 - 3 times as much offer. Wifey is happy!"
B0791VS3N9,John,5,Great device for the price. Perfect phone for a parent who doesn't need alot of bells and whistles but still needs something reliable
B0791VS3N9,Car_Guy_in_So.CA,4,"Excellent value in an inexpensive phone. Not as nice as a Galaxy S7 but kess than one-half the price. Battery life has been excellent too. Audio quality is very clear. Seems to be fairly durable, did buy protective case and glass shield."
B0791VS3N9,Shamime,5,"Very fast and looks great, haven't had any issues so far. Rear camera is great, front not so much. Good storage with the option of a micro SD card."
B0791VS3N9,Dillan Crisp,4,"Wonderful device, wouldn't choose any other phone at this price point! only issue i see currently after about a month of usage is that the speaker is not terrible but not pleasant to listen to, and there must be something up with the amp inside the phone for the headphone jack because after a strip of audio has been played there is a noticeably annoying static and hiss."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Have only used it once so far as got it to use with Roam mobility when I go to US unfortunately my SIM card with my server is to large and does not fit to use with duel SIM cards which my son does and loves.Did do some setups with my WiFi at home do like it better then my Samsung phone.
B0791VS3N9,Enrique,4,"My previous review was unfair to Heawei. Had I taken the proper steps, my music would probably have downloaded. Additionally, I should have gone to my phone carrier to transfer all my data."
B0791VS3N9,Vince L.,5,Much better than the $100 Blu phones. Enough memory to get stuff installed and very responsive. A nice phone of you go through many per year like I do and don't want to throw money away.
B0791VS3N9,Anna Sacay,4,"The Huawei mate se phone is excellent. I am still trying to figure some features. But I love my new phone. The pictures the quality is great. But the only thing is the sound quality . I have to put volume up on high. Especially the price is affordable. Although I wanted to go with another carrier, this phone is only compatible with GSM which is AT&T or T- Mobile. I would really recommend you try to buy and see for yourself."
B0791VS3N9,Kyle N.,5,"To be honest, I was skeptical about this phone because of the almost perfect reviews its was getting for a budget phone. For a budget phone in 2018, this phone does almost everything my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 does but actually works when I try to make calls and texts others unlike my Note 5. After using this phone for about 4 days now, I can honestly say that it is worth the purchase for those who are looking for a phone that works very well when needed."
B0791VS3N9,chin sau fong,1,"Don't Buy!!!!!!
Wasted your money!!!
I give 0 start... Buy not even a month
Freeze , camara not working, sent to fix
Say my phone liquid damage!!!
My phone not even has a drip or drop....
Call again they say can't fix it in ðºð¸,
Mean have to throw the phone away.
HUAWEIðððððð"
B0791VS3N9,tampanews,2,"Phone arbitrarily closes apps despite using ""lock"" feature to keep the app open. Doesn't play well with apps: Twitter won't launch its in-app browser requiring use of Chrome or Firefox; Google's Tap to Translate feature refuses to consistently activate. Also, am I correct in understanding that after 5 attempts of entering password, you'd be locked out of your phone forever and your data lost?!"
B0791VS3N9,bryanbogey,5,"Worked good here in the states, was working good with two different carriers in Panama and then I lost it. At least it wasn't connected to some plan that could be taken advantage of. Will look at buying another one."
B0791VS3N9,SG,5,"I will say my daughter has only had the phone for a week but she is very impressed with the speed and camera (what else do teens look for?). I am sure my kid is no different than others who break or lose a phone more often than we like. She was offered an iPhone but declined and preferred an Android. In comparing the phones out there it was a bit difficult to drop $800 or more on a phone which may be lost or broken in a year or two. For the money this phone is hard to beat. 4G of RAM, 64G or internal storage, which can be expanded. Great rear and phone camera, plus a large full HD screen. Sure it is missing Gorilla glass and a few other perks. But I challenge you to find a phone at this price or even close with the features and performance of the Mate SE. Just a helpful hint, when looking for cases you will find more listed for the Honor 7X phone which is identical in size, etc of the Mate SE."
B0791VS3N9,biteme,4,"The phone was bought for my girl to YouTube and chat mostly but she said it seemed to be slower than her old LG G3. That said ALLOT. Other than that, it seems to do whatever it's supposed to do just fine."
B0791VS3N9,Dervish Mountolympus,5,This one great phone. In this price you cannot get any smart phone with this high performance. I really recommend that to everyone. I got 2 more when get this one thanks I donât have buy iPhone or similar price phones anymore
B0791VS3N9,iadude,5,This is probably the best phone value available. Not sure some people believe price for all the features it has. Up to 3 days on battery life. Have recommend to many friends. Would buy again.
B0791VS3N9,Henry Mata Lindo,5,Excellent product. This telefocno offers professional camera options. good speed in data processing. good screen resolution and long battery life. very happy with my phone.
B0791VS3N9,Sixto,3,"For the most part, the phone was very good, But the EMUI feature would not allow Apps that I needed to run in the background, to work properly."
B0791VS3N9,JW,5,"Both my wife and I have used this phone for over half a year. This phone is pretty fast and reliable compared to my last phone, a Samsung note 5. The battery life is especially amazing. So far, I only reached to 20% of the battery once when I watched Netflix for a few episodes. The only drawback is the picture quality, especially under low light. But it's good enough for taking regular pictures without too much zoom in."
B0791VS3N9,Cody B.,5,"So far, the performance of an $800 phone at a fraction of the price! Beautiful display, responsive and fast load times, quality camera. As of day one, I am very happy with my purchase, and am glad I didn't go with an iPhone 8 or S9. So far the only drawback I have found is a lock of accessories, screen protectors, cases, etc. Hopefully that will change in due time."
B0791VS3N9,Jeffrey P. Keryk,5,"For $225, this thing rocks. Turbo fast. I gave it as a gift to a friend to replace and older iPhone. She loves it."
B0791VS3N9,E,5,I have been looking at phones for awhile and this sat on my wish list the longest. I love this phone and adore the price. I came from an Iphone6 plus and it was easy to switch to android and honestly the space plus battery life blew my mind. Add that it takes good pictures and handles excellently... It's amazing
B0791VS3N9,ohlalala,5,"This is the second Huawei unlocked cell phone I bought. Both phones are great.
This phone has big screen and runs very fast. It is easy to use and very functonal.
My husband is using Samsung galaxy 7 and I have to say, this phone if it is not better than his, must be as good as his Samsung.
It is great phone from any perspective!!!"
B0791VS3N9,MarSch,5,"Like this new Android Oreo operating system, lot of new features."
B0791VS3N9,ItsMeChelle,4,"Quick, Sleek

So far, so good!
Intuitive, fast. Sleek design! Not the best camera good enough.
Only complaint is the way they package the item- no bubble wrap:) Just the small Huawei box inside. Should be sent properly packed since esp for a phone. No damage. Thankfully! 4+"
B0791VS3N9,Liyan X.,4,"The phone is well made and looks premium, but battery is weak. It can barely last one day with moderate use."
B0791VS3N9,KJ,4,This is a good phone for the price. But has one issue - the navigation keys on the bottom of the screen have response problems. Sometimes I have to press 2-3 time to get a response. I contacted to Amazon about this problem and got a replacement. But the replacement phone has same issue.
B0791VS3N9,Ramkumar K,4,"Great phone for thr price. Fast and navigation is smooth. Even got it with Android 7, upgraded to 8 after switched on."
B0791VS3N9,Lauro,5,"I am in love with this product. The fingerprint identification that is used to unlock the phone is fast! It really is an unlocked phone. The instructions inside the package was easy to follow, and I was able to set up the phone in minutes. You can also unlock the phone with pin or the dots. This is a fantastic Android phone! It also comes with a phone case. I wish it also came with a screen protector or at least where I can buy a screen protector for the phone. Either way, I am in love with this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Kgreen176,1,Dont work in United States
B0791VS3N9,cocolavan,4,"I love this phone. I was pleasantly surprised by the user experience. I am a first time user of Huawei and I'm sold. There is no need for me to purchase an iPhone again. I'm not knocking anyone, but this phone gets the job done at a fraction of the cost. It has a decent camera and storage."
B0791VS3N9,Rafael,5,"I have been always a BlackBerry user and Android user but this time ""emui"" got me with its oreo version, am in love with this cell phone, it's just more than what you can expect from a budget, am actually gonna buy huawei flagship am impressed with this piece of equipment and you should give it a try I know you won't regret it"
B0791VS3N9,Tonya Shoemaker,5,"This is the best phone I've had in a while. My last device was a Blu which I adored but this one is right up there. Works great, good looking camera as well. Just make sure you case it properly and add a screen protector!"
B0791VS3N9,M.McKennaJr.,5,Don't hesitate to buy this phone. Unbelievably Great Phone
B0791VS3N9,Lady Marie,5,I just love my phone. I fell in love with it as soon as I got it in my hands. I'd also buy another one in the future. I like Huawei.
B0791VS3N9,Elvis Ysabel R,5,El equipo estÃ¡ nuevo y funciona muy bien
B0791VS3N9,Mas7arChi3f,5,"I bought this as a present and they loved it. I loved it. You'll love it. For the price, it'll be hard to find better. It does not come with headphones but I usually buy better ones anyway."
B0791VS3N9,Allen,5,"I got this phone a couple weeks ago and so far i love it. The Battery is excellent,it will last all day with plenty of charge left. It is very fast,love that 4gb of ram. Picture guality is really good and the sound isn't too bad. I'm coming from a Galaxy S6 phone and i think it is better phone. Very well pleased."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I love this phone! Amazing value for all of the features it comes with. I definitely recommend this phone.
B0791VS3N9,Mandy,5,Nice phone.
B0791VS3N9,Shane C. Webb,4,"Iâve had this phone for close to a month now and Iâm very happy with it. My previous 2 devices were Moto Gs, with the most recent being the G4. The G4 was a great phone that was only hampered by my dumb decision not to get the model with more RAM and Storage. I assumed I would get the G6 when it was released, but the announced specs were disappointing, (this will be the first G6 to not have a 6XX series snapdragon processor), and the price is higher than previous iterations. To be honest, the Moto E5 Plus is more attractive as a true budget phone.
The Huwaei Mate SE had solid reviews and great specs for the price, so I decided to buy it. I also considered waiting for the Nokia 6.1, but again, the specs (3GB RAM and 32GB on base model) donât campare to the Huwaei.
Pros:
Screen - I really like the 18X9 screen. The quality is great, with no color hues.
Fingerprint Scanner - I never understood the big deal about these things, but now I canât imagine living without it. It is lightning fast.
Memory & Storage - I think that anything with less than 4GB of RAM will not last more than a year without starting to significantly lag. With 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage this phone should perform well for a while.
UI - The custom UI is actually pretty decent, and close to stock Android. This was actually the only thing made me consider not purchasing the phone, as Iâve enjoyed the stock android on my Motos, and know that the Samsung UI is really annoying. This one is pretty straight forward.
OS - The Android 8.0 update came through today and resolved some issues. The touch sensitivity on the screen was an issue, but seems to be resolved now. Also, I had issues with pairing with my car that are now fixed. Nice!!
Camera - Iâm not a great judge of picture quality, and Iâm not going to say that it takes better pictures than my wifeâs iphone 7. It doesnât. It does, however, take much better photos than my G4 ever did. Thatâs all I really need. The camera could load faster, but oh well.
Processor - Plenty fast for my needs. In the ballpark of a 6XX series snapdragon, but it does underperform in nearly all benchmark tests. I donât play many games, but I downloaded PubG, just to see how it did, and it played nicely with no lag.
Case - Just want to point out that it comes with a pretty decent clear case. I didnât realize it when I ordered it. Consider that when you purchase the phone.
Cons:
OS - I miss the gesture controls for the camera and flashlight that I had on the Motos.
Network - GSM Only. Not necessarily a negative, but you should be aware of it. I bought a 12 month card for RedPocket and the service is pretty great.
No NFC - Iâve never had this, but I imagine itâs like the FP Scanner. Once you have it, you probably donât want to go without it.
No Type C or turbo charging - For me, this is the only true negative. Fortunately, after nearly a decade of android ownership I have amassed roughly 3 million micro-USB cables, so Iâm never more than a few feet away from a convenient, albeit slow, charging solution.
Thatâs all the negatives I can think of right now. All in all, a fantastic phone for $250 (price when I bought it, $229 now). If youâre a casual user like myself (no intense games, rarely watch videos), thereâs no reason to buy anything more expensive than this range of phone."
B0791VS3N9,sara,5,Great for the price. The picture quality is ok. Not as good as my old Huawei phone which is also twice as expensive as this one. If you are particular about picture quality you may want to buy a more extensive phone. This is a basic inexpensive phone.
B0791VS3N9,Jose Green,5,"I like everything about the phone, the camera, battery, memory, size, I almost give up and no buy the phone because I had read a comment that someone made, saying that the battery take to long to charge but it is looks like it was not true because my phone battery get charge very fast, this phone is amazing, kudos to the Huawei company, they are making the best phones in the market right now."
B0791VS3N9,Florido,4,"Great budget phone, great battery and performance"
B0791VS3N9,aaron74,5,I spent days researching for a replacement phone for my dying Note 4. But it needed to be affordable and unlockable. And this phone met all my needs. All I can say is I love it.
B0791VS3N9,MDC,5,Huawei has a lot of features at an exceptional price.....
B0791VS3N9,mike,4,Very nice phone for the price. Has a lot of high end functions that you would not expect from a 200 dollar phone. Why pay 1000 dollars when you can get the same quality and functions in this very well built phone.
B0791VS3N9,M Brown,5,"I've had three Samsung Galaxy phones over the years, all of which had poor battery life. I can go days without charging this one, and it has everything I need in a phone."
B0791VS3N9,Cheyanna Dee Huff,5,So far (I've only had it for a few days) this is one of the nicest phones I've had. Works well and takes beautiful pictures. I am using it with a Mint Mobile SIM card and so far I couldn't be happier
B0791VS3N9,Rich Britt,1,This phone is not truly unlocked between cricket and I we still cannot get it to send or receive pictures and there are areas in your phone you cannot access. What a waste of Money..
B0791VS3N9,Jessy1122,5,Runs perfectly. The screen is really good and system runs very fast.
B0791VS3N9,Etta Rodriguez,5,I've had this phone for a few months now. It's really great quality and has great battery life for an excellent price. I definitely recommend!
B0791VS3N9,BP,5,Really like this phone for the money. Does everything I need it to do without spending 1000 bucks on one of the supposedly premium phones.
B0791VS3N9,pfeil.Customer,5,"Highly rated, which is why I bought it.Works on Cricket wireless...( You may have to purchase a smaller SIM card ( I did- only $10 though)"
B0791VS3N9,Dustin,5,Extremely good deal for what you get. Compared to the competition Huawei can't be beat. The value for your money is amazing. These phones are half the price of a comparable competitors handset.
B0791VS3N9,Soloman Bouwer,5,For the price you cannot get better. Used to be an Apple fan... until I discovered Huawei!!! So much better in every sense of the word!!!
B0791VS3N9,Bri McNutt,5,"The Huawei Mate SE is a FANTASTIC phone at this price point. You get an amazing screen, phenomenal storage, RAM for days, and a stupefying processor. Everyday tasks are smooth as butter and gaming is fun.

Simply put, this is the best phone to get at this price.

For those of you on Cricket Wireless, set up is a breeze. Simply put the nano dim from your phone into this one. While this phone does accept two SIM cards I used one of the slots as an SD card slot."
B0791VS3N9,Brian LaCount,5,"Fantastic phone, amazing specs and fantastic price."
B0791VS3N9,Mikhail,5,"Been using the phone 4 a week. Fast, quick, decent pictures. Satisfied with the purchase"
B0791VS3N9,A Thomas,5,"I love this phone. After my htc got damaged I asked my IT guy what phone would he suggget as a replacement. I wanted to try something new. He suggested an iPhone or Huawei. I went with the Huawei and am very pleased. Phone fast and graphics sharp. I also like the quick photo feature with the volume button. I like photos.

Would definitely recommend."
B0791VS3N9,HM,5,It's just like an iPhone only much cheaper. I purchased this one for my mother. I bought one directly from the company a fee years back and it's still performing well.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,It's a good cheap phone
B0791VS3N9,Katherine,5,"Very good phone! Good looking and pretty heavy. It has every function you expected. Iâve been using it for a while and everything works well. I like the camera, it takes very nice picture!"
B0791VS3N9,John Dolphin,5,"It came early, good quality"
B0791VS3N9,Anthony,5,This is the US version of the Honor 7X in Europe. Itâs a fantastic flagship killer. With a cheap phone as good as this you donât need to spend $$$ on an iPhone or Samsung. Design is perfect copy of iPhone 6s but taller and slimmer. Quality handset at bargain price.
B0791VS3N9,Michele A. Bittikofer,4,"I'm praying this cell doesn't just freeze n die on me. I really like the phone and have a card in for Xtra space. For the money, as good as my old Samsung 5. Why pay that much for a new cell. Again, praying it doesn't just die after my 60 days which is on 4 days. Great cell 2day."
B0791VS3N9,DAO,5,Only had it for a few weeks but so far I really like it. Works great.
B0791VS3N9,Rallexxx,5,"The fingerprint password is blazing fast. Build is solid and sytlish. The Phone clone app, made a fast and easy transfer from my old phone. Connectivity is strong on WiFi and LTE. Very happy."
B0791VS3N9,Infaimous,5,"Got this for my dad. Design is great and phone looks up to par with the likes of the iphone and samsungs. I typically wouldnt buy this brand, but i have their smart watch for over 3 years, always get complement on it and decided to give the phone a try."
B0791VS3N9,thecrow32,4,"I bought one of my kids the Honor 7x and one the Huawei Mate SE. Both are great, low cost and beautiful phones. From the outside, the only difference I can see is the color and the camera housing being a single piece on the Mate SE. You can definitely tell the Mate is a little more responsive with the extra RAM. If you weren't already aware, there are some big limitations to these phones. You can only connect to 2.4Ghz wireless and Bluetooth shares an antenna with wifi, which means you get slower performance on wifi when using blootooth. You also don't get fast charging or USB type C, which really isn't a huge deal to me. It seems to charge fast enough. The body is a great size and it really does look very pretty overall. For kids who want something that looks good, but you won't be too concerned about losing or breaking, this is a great option and one I would recommend. At the current price of $230, the extra 30 dollars is worth it over the 7x for the extra memory/storage."
B0791VS3N9,Daniel Salisbury,4,It's a great phone with plenty of storage for me and it's super fast but my only issue is once you get the update added to the phone my messages will stop showing on messenger unless I restart the phone
B0791VS3N9,Uriel G.,4,"Overall a very good cellphone, good battery, excellent display, easy to use and very good cameras. Bad about it is that often one needs to tap on the display many times before the choice is accepted."
B0791VS3N9,Dutchess,5,GREAT BATTERY LIFE! Nice size screen.
B0791VS3N9,Klaire,5,"This is an awesome phone especially for the price. I needed a new phone, works with At&t, has great storage and has a pretty fast processor. I read the reviews thoroughly before purchasing and I'm glad I bought it. The camera takes decent pics but not like the newest phones out there. Charges fast which is a plus!"
B0791VS3N9,Aditya,4,"in this price, it is having all the features that any good phone should have. it is running very smooth with multiple applications open. the only lagging area that i could figure out is its sound quality, which is not bad but not good as i thought. Apart from that, everything else is perfectly fine with this phone.
If you are looking for any budget phone with all the running features, then this should be the best option i could find."
B0791VS3N9,Spind44,5,I bought the phone for my mom to replace her IPhone 4. It took her a month to get used to the Android interface. So far it has not had any problems.
B0791VS3N9,chiayu1122,5,"This phone is a fantastic phone I never had. I am an android phone fan, but the price for the premium phones usually are not friendly. For a $200 phone, Huawei mate SE is with great quality on hardware as well as the cameras. I cannot imagine this price can buy this kind of premium phone. Highly recommendation to buy this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Brooke,4,Purchased back in May this phone is one of the better phones I have had. I'm now starting to have problems with the finger print sensor.
B0791VS3N9,Eliza,3,Itâs good for the price but the picture quality is really bad. I would not recommend this for those who are seeking a phone with good camera like me.
B0791VS3N9,Xi Pan,5,"This is like a dream phone as it is fast, cheap, and with a huge battery. I brought three all at once and am very happy with my purchase. I dont believe any other brand can come even close to this wonderful phone."
B0791VS3N9,Maniyazhagan,4,"I like it, good performance."
B0791VS3N9,Billy Bob 1955,4,"Has the look AND feel of a phone costing much more. Slick outer/ GREAT colors.Has the usual challenges of ""set-up"". Cust service is outstanding."
B0791VS3N9,Luca Boyd,4,"Nice and fast. Very good for the price.....But if you or the places you go use 5 GHz routers, your phone simply won't see them."
B0791VS3N9,Saso I.,5,"Purchased for my dad, for the money hands down the best phone currently in the $200 price point. Huawei quality is currently a top contender."
B0791VS3N9,ARK,5,"Like - Face and touch ID, great graphics, does not crash or freeze even when playing demanding games, easy to add micro SD and that it supports dual nano sim. Solid battery life with great power saving option. Great camera with dual lens

Don't like - comes with a lot of pre-installed apps (not that big of a deal, since these apps can be deleted)"
B0791VS3N9,Erik,5,Good cheap phone only thing I hate it the OS I reather have a pure Android OS not a edited one this makes the apps ugly
B0791VS3N9,Dior,5,We loved it.
B0791VS3N9,J R,3,"I really wanted to like this phone and initially I did. Everything about it is great except the reception. I live in a somewhat rural area and in the past I'll have to go outside to make phone calls once in a while. With this phone, even if I go outside, people always complain that I am breaking up or they can't hear me. It will show two bars but have terrible reception. When I'm in other areas I don't seem to have this problem, but it's annoying that my wife can use her phone inside our house just fine and I cannot make a call anywhere on our property when we have the same carrier.

Update:
Phone went swimming in a water bowl for a split second and screen stopped working. Given the opportunity to buy this same phone again (I already had a case and I liked that the micro USB is very popular among other devices) I opted for a different phone in the same price range and just bought a new case and a bunch of new USB c cables. I didn't want to take the risk of having a phone with poor reception issues again, so I went back to Motorola which has never let me down in that area. (Also, my new phone is waterproof, which should prevent another accident like that from happening)"
B0791VS3N9,dhoyos,5,Great phone. No qualms. No problems with signal (t_mobile customer). Very customizable.
B0791VS3N9,Carenna,5,I have been waiting to buy this phone so my anticipation was extremely high! I am so happy with my new phone so so happy!!!
B0791VS3N9,RoosterinOxnard,5,"This phone is Just Great, Does most everything you will ever need. Even my friends with an I Phone say it is Amazing. Set up my Google Business account and all the Data fast and easy."
B0791VS3N9,Sean,5,I was unable to sync this phone with T-Mobile which is why I bought it so I had to get a refund
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Love this inexpensive smart phone. Every phone is a compromise but this one has very few that matter to me. I have had it for about a month and it had been wonderful.
B0791VS3N9,Jing Zhang,5,Very good user experience for this phone. I used iphone 3 to 6 before. And this phone is the first low price phone I purchased this may. It turns out that I am extremely satisfied with the price I paid for and this phone meets for all my needs. Would buy a similar phone in the future for someone else.
B0791VS3N9,Manuel Campos,5,This is an amazing phone. I can't believe that I can have such a good device for a great Price. So far completely satisfied with it.
B0791VS3N9,Scott Condor,5,"My gosh, this little skinny phone has more power and speed than my high speed desktop from just 4 years ago! Plus I don't have to mess with windows hahahah. We bought two of them and set them both up at the same time... a simple chore but it took time because we first did the clone trick from our Huawei Honor 6X phones and then did the lengthy upgrade to EMUI 8.0. The cloning operation was spectacular... suddenly the new phone had EVERYTHING from our old phones, apps, contacts, pictures, videos, music, files... and then much better because faster and great full HD screen. Odd how it can have virtually the same outside dimensions, but the screen pictures are a half inch bigger! Great photos and videos, everything!

I do not have a single complaint or reservation about this phone yet, compared to any phone I've ever owned, and I've had some flagships. Easy operation, quick learning curve from the 6X, the cases we bought fit perfectly and securely.

This review will grow as I learn more about this phone, but to be able to get one this nice, this beautiful, this convenient and powerful for such a low price is just amazing. No wonder the competitors are creating fake news about it."
B0791VS3N9,Woodsey,1,Won't work on my Verizon Network. Just another nail in the Verizon coffin for me.
B0791VS3N9,Zeyu Yi,5,"A little bit expensive but itâs good, as expected. Sometimes a little bit slow while running programs and applications. Slower than an iPhone...."
B0791VS3N9,Hernan,5,"Incredible phone.
Coming from an iPhone 7S, I needed a cheaper replacement.
This beast is no cheap at all.
Incredible performance, excellent battery life, premium feel, run all tasks with no problem, wonderful fingerprint sensor with multiple uses.
I'm very happy with my choice."
B0791VS3N9,Yolonda Epps,5,The quality is as good as a $900 + Samsung or iPhone for under $300. A fraction of the price with just a few differeing specs. You won't regret purchasing. Also fast delivery.
B0791VS3N9,Zach Quint,5,"So far this is a beautiful, fast, crisp, snappy, awesome phone. The EMUI layer over regular Android is a vast improvement. Battery is great. Apps run great. Phone is great. No, really. This phone is awesome. And I feel safer having China spy on me instead of the NSA."
B0791VS3N9,Andrei,5,Really good phone for a pretty low price. Thanks China.
B0791VS3N9,Joseph DiThomas,5,Best phone I have oened. Im using it on Metro Pcs and it works perfectly.
B0791VS3N9,Ashley,1,I bought the phone and was happy with it initially but it will not restart and will not accept a charge. Do not waste your money and I will not buy another one of their products.
B0791VS3N9,Henry,4,"camera is not as good as advertised

system and screen is a little slow.screen is not good for game."
B0791VS3N9,Wmac,4,Solid phone for a good price. I've had this phone for 6 months and have had no issues yet. Happy with purchase
B0791VS3N9,NAME_NOT_RETURNED,5,The sound comes from below so you will cover the sound from time to time. Nothing to envy a Samsung or an IPhone. Good storage. Great phone!
B0791VS3N9,Montez English,5,"Clean, quick & fits right in your hand... Easy set up for a T Mobile user... Basic Android but I'm all for Android instead of Apple. Bright & battery lasts all day"
B0791VS3N9,LJ,5,One of the best phones in the market today. Bought for my high schooler and he loves it. Smart looking elegant phone with all the bells and whistles.
B0791VS3N9,Wendell Perry,4,This phone is well worth the money you spend it quick and takes great pics I can't say anything bad about this phone.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I am very impressed with this phone. It is beautifully designed, has a vibrant screen, it's fast, takes great photos and the thumb print sensor works perfectly. Great phone at surprisingly low price."
B0791VS3N9,OtakuLife005,3,"The phone itself is spectacular for the price point. However, the speaker is absolute garbage. Huge letdown considering how great the rest of the phone is.."
B0791VS3N9,Chipawa,5,Exceptional phone. Really fast excellent quality. We are phone fans from here on out. Don't curve the screen please.....ever.
B0791VS3N9,katie lew,5,So far I loved the phone and impressed with the delivery. I just received the phone this afternoon and placed the order less than 24 hours ago!
B0791VS3N9,soheil,5,"I have had mine for two weeks. I have no issues with it. Super fast, great quality. Very very fast finger print sensor. This phone is so smooth, and in this price, it's literary the best you can get. I am so satisfied with the phone, that I have decided to buy their tablets too."
B0791VS3N9,ken,5,Love this brand. Best battery life of all the others.
B0791VS3N9,Todd,5,"I have had this phone for almost 3 months now and I love it. I upgraded from Galaxy S4 and this Huawei is quick and fast, the camera is great, and the battery lasts me about 36 hours with normal usage. Beats spending $600+ on a OnePlus."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I really like this phone. Lots of memory, light weight, great pictures, very fast in picking up internet. Also, in a bad cell area, it had great reception compared to even a Samsung Galaxy 8 (same carrier)."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Wow! I am impressed with this phone! Easy to set up, works great. I haven't found anything I don't like about it yet (have had it for two days) and so far think it is just as good as phones that I have spent four times as much on!
Update 3 months later: Had an issue with the battery not charging. Looked at the Huawei tech support site but didn't find an answer. Started a chat and within minutes had the solution. My rating remains unchanged!"
B0791VS3N9,The_Rick,5,"I switched to this from Samsung S5 and I love it. Not much bloatware to deal with, fast, functional, light. Good phone for the price."
B0791VS3N9,luis galindez,5,"I have been using for a few months, i have 5 emails, instagram, twitter, whatssap, telegram, and around 70 more apps, and today is working really fine, is a great based on price/quality product."
B0791VS3N9,Winter,4,"I'm not a huge fan of the tall thin screen shape, but it works pretty well. Specs are great for the price"
B0791VS3N9,ESM,5,"Nice phone, very good vslue for money."
B0791VS3N9,Steve James,5,"Absolutely awesome phone for the price , tired of paying crazy money for phones just to break two years later ,"
B0791VS3N9,BENJAMIN PERREN,5,"Best phone I have ever had! Been using Blackberry for over 10 years, was a very welcome upgrade. It's hard adjusting to a touch interface e keyboard VA the qwerty keyboard, but this phone is much more compatible. Only complaint is the edges can hurt your hands after hours of prolonged use."
B0791VS3N9,D. F.,5,Best budget phone of 2018! You will not be disappointed!
B0791VS3N9,Alan Rose,4,Make sure you are comfortable with a thin phone. I am and it is powerful and I think a good bang for your buck.
B0791VS3N9,L. Ari,5,"I got it for my brother he likes it and even thought is cheep it's really good quality and fast, screen is also very good"
B0791VS3N9,Steven W. Lloyd,5,headline says it all.
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,5,"Amazing phone, I love it more than my husband's Galexy S9."
B0791VS3N9,Official Product Tester,5,Best budget phone of 2018. I absolutely love it and the camera is amazing and i think gold is so pretty :D. Delivery was even earlier than expected. I would recommend this phone to anyone out there looking for a great phone but doesn't have $1000 to spend on the latest flagships.
B0791VS3N9,S. Nelles,1,"My employees do not even know how to answer phone calls on this phone. Picture quality sucks. If youâre expecting a phone like a Samsung, this is not the phone to buy."
B0791VS3N9,LOC LE,5,"The most buget and amazing phone!!!
This phone has such a attractive appearance, nice screen resolution, excellent camera with this cheap price, so much better than my previous Sony XA2 Ultra which is two times more expensive."
B0791VS3N9,NT77,5,"I have only been using it for a few days so far, so I can't speak to longevity. However everything else about the phone seems great so far. Battery life is solid, by which I mean normal use (some light internet browsing and a few phone calls) don't seem to take it below 90% after 24 hours. One of my biggest concerns based on research before buying was the camera, but the camera seems to work fine for me - so I can only assume that it was being compared to the camera on a flagship phone, which you would reasonably expect to be amazing. I will update this review if it dies a premature death, but as it stands now I'm very pleased with my purchase."
B0791VS3N9,vay,5,Kinda of surprise how well built this phone was. It feels solid and screen quality is pretty good too. It feels almost as good as my Samsung Galaxy S8+.
B0791VS3N9,hong huang,5,"Fast beautiful phone. Any penny you spend is 200% worth it. So US wants to block this phone and some people just leave bad comments even they don't have the phone in handy. Good performance (not excellent coz its not 1000$$$ iPhone X). If you scared the company spies you, ask Facebook 1st."
B0791VS3N9,kaytmay,4,"I bought this phone and has taken me a while to realize you absolutely have no ability to save apps or much of anything to your extended stay card. This information is not noted in the specs at all. There is no camera selection for choosing SD storage. As a matter of fact the SD storage icon is not in color like the in phone storage is...in the settings. You can select for things to go into the SD storage but there is no name of SD storage or what's in it that you can see. Makes me think nothing is going in there even though I have that selected
If you are thinking of buying this phone you best take this into account and research it. I am by no means tech savvy but I have been reading and I see I am not the only one puzzled that Huawei has done this. My last cheaper Huawei 5X did not have this issue. This will certainly be my last Huawei phone. It's too late to return...SMH... Huawei ruined a beautiful phone by omitting the ability to move apps etc on SD. Makes the SD slot useless."
B0791VS3N9,Casey Riley,5,"Great phone, great features, and a great price. Had an LG G3 before so its a major upgrade compared to that older phone.

AT&T store had nothing in stock that was close to what this give you for the price."
B0791VS3N9,Robert J.,4,"Just received this phone. Very big screen, easy set up. Pretty much like any other Android phone. It's very responsive and has not skipped a beat from my prior lg g5 phone which I sent back due to a warranty issue. I love the 64 GB storage as I'm tired of fighting my lg g5 for room on the phone. Also, the battery lasts forever. It takes decent pictures but I do need a little more time with the camera to write a complete review. Over all a very surprisingly decent product!"
B0791VS3N9,PeterI,5,So far all is good- excellent screen and feels good in the hand! Calls are clear and texting no problem
B0791VS3N9,wwiding,5,I love this phone. I'm upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S5. If you're looking for a budget phone this is the one you want.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Excellent picture quality! So far, the phone is working great. I only had it for a couple of days."
B0791VS3N9,Aryan,2,The Bluetooth doesn't work simultaneously with wifi.
B0791VS3N9,Mike,5,Can't believe how cheap and powerful this device is. I literally gave up my S8+ for this.
B0791VS3N9,Diana Bravo,5,"A comparacion con mi telefono lg v20 este tiene muy buen rendimiento en fotos, videos y mas, mi esposo esta satisfecho y ya compramos de nuevo para mi mama"
B0791VS3N9,Customer,5,"This is an excellent phone. Not just for the price, but as a competitor to iPhone and Galaxy. I've had iPhones since 2008. I'm now Huawei. I love it."
B0791VS3N9,An Huang,5,"Awesome phone! I have had iPhones and HTC prior to owning this Huawei, and I could definitely say that this phone is comparable to those big company / popular phones (if not better)! You have to see it and experience it yourself. Such an underrated phone with such a great price!!!"
B0791VS3N9,Sarah,5,"Good price and good quality,my second Huawei cellphone."
B0791VS3N9,marusz,5,Dont waste ur money for expensive phones.. I GOT huawei mate se for myself and my wife and we are very happy!! Good quality phone vey nice picures works perfect with metro pcs.. Very recommended!
B0791VS3N9,Jasper,5,"Love the camera !!!! awesome pictures and fast data download. picks up wifi quickly..Happy with this purchase !!!
no more Samsung for me !!"
B0791VS3N9,Janet,5,"This is our second purchase, I love it a lot and it has a very good picture quality"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Excellent phone. Not just an excellent phone for the money. I'm sure there are better phones out there (pen, speaker, camera, usb-c, etc). But there is not a phone with a zeiss lense or speakers that are $800 better or more than these. As a matter of fact, since I buy for quality and value, there's not a phone on the market that is $800 or more better than this one."
B0791VS3N9,Lee L.,5,"A thousand dollar phone in a lesser amount price tag.

Dual lens . Fingerprint recognition. Expandable storage. Great UI. hidden gem."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon loyal buyer,5,"Better than the phones I had, very fast, a lot of apps, come with a case, solid performance."
B0791VS3N9,Angelica mayorga,5,Lo recomiendo muy buen telÃ©fono las fotos las tomas muy bonitas me encanta muchas gracias !
B0791VS3N9,Kcui,5,For the price I paid for the phone it's a lot better than iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 8. When you hold the phone you can feel the excellent quality of the phone. The 64GB memory really helps a lot. Overall very happy to purchase the phone.
B0791VS3N9,Dominick DiChiaro,5,This phone is great for the price. It's fast and has a great picture. Camera is nice too. Don't miss out!
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Nice phone good quality great price just wish the screen was better quality like Samsung
B0791VS3N9,Name not found,4,Love the phone and battery life. Hate the camera.
B0791VS3N9,sweetpapa,5,"This phone is the best kept secret in the industry,"
B0791VS3N9,Anna Bearr,5,This phone is amazing! Takes such good photos! And very durable phone. Really good phone for such a really good price love it!
B0791VS3N9,Guillermo,5,I bought it for my son and liked so much it will be my Samsung's replacement
B0791VS3N9,Mary Schwark,5,"This phone met my expectations. Works fast and smooth. Definitely a good value for the money
Very nice phone."
B0791VS3N9,Genna,5,"Haven't had this phone for long, but so far I love it! Such a great price considering the $700+ price tag on big brand name phones. It may not compare to those, but it has everything I could want or need. I needed a better camera, it has a good one. And I didn't think I would like the fingerprint scanner this much, it works really well!"
B0791VS3N9,Fred,5,"I love the phone, easy to setup, good camera, long battery life, fast response, nice user experience, ... much better than $400+ other phones."
B0791VS3N9,mike,5,"This is how a phone should work and feel.
I watched 2 movies full screen. Great picture.
Sound very good. Calls clear and crisp."
B0791VS3N9,Kate and John,5,"An amazing phone, writing the review from it now! The pictures look high quality and the phone handles everything smoothly. The sound is okay I wish it was louder but I still like it!"
B0791VS3N9,Roger Kolenda,5,"Listen, this phone is WORTH IT! Fast, elegant, quality, just to name a few... I have had it only about 3 weeks, and absolutely love it. It's right up there with the big hitters like Galaxy 9, and I phone."
B0791VS3N9,Joseph R Grant,5,"I upgraded from an HTC Desire 626s to try and find a well-performing up-to-date phone on a budget. This phone has met all my expectations so far. Great amount of storage, great performance, highly recommended."
B0791VS3N9,Taty,5,ok
B0791VS3N9,Marisa,5,"Excelente todo. Tiempo de entrega. estado del producto
En Argentina funciona de diez. RÃ¡pido la baterÃ­a dura dos dÃ­as por lo menos"
B0791VS3N9,M.S.C.,5,"This phone has worked incredibly well. The operating system and processor are fast, and it has a lot of memory."
B0791VS3N9,Huck,5,"Battery is a tad weak and ii would be better with ""5"" WiFi. For the money though, it stands alone."
B0791VS3N9,Denny Le,5,Better than my LG n Sony phone. Like it so much bought mom n wife one...
B0791VS3N9,Sofman,5,"Great Budget phone!
Pros: Long Battery Life, great look and huge screen.
Cons: No fast charge, Camera has some grainy pictures."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Holy crap!!!! The battery life on this baby is amazing.
Normally listening and streaming music on my work shift will take my battery from 100% down to around 20%. With this device, the same 9 hour shift, I walk out of work with just under 80%. Loving this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Just Another Shopper,5,"I added a wireless charging receiver that I bought on Amazon for $7-$8 and used the clear jelly case that came with the phone. Now I can charge it in my car or at home without wires.
The calls are clear, the camera(s) are great and battery life is long.
The fingerprint reader works better than I expected. I had a Samsung s6 before and this is many times faster.
A large screen was one of my requirements, so that I wouldn't have to put on reading glasses. This is just right for me.
A couple days after turning the phone on, it downloaded and installed Android 8.0 (Oreo).
I highly recommend this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Doug Roberts,5,Great phone! Everything about it works as well or better than the flagship OnePlus 3 phone I bought two years ago at twice the price.
B0791VS3N9,jrn,4,"Strong build . Average sound volume, decent picture quality... recommend as a good budget phone .. video buffering and camera are ok.. giving 4 stars since volume is just ok"
B0791VS3N9,Chris P.,5,"This has been one of the best Android phones I've ever owned. I've had minor issues with Bluetooth audio stuttering, but other than that this phone is just as good as the high-end flagship devices from Samsung, LG, or Motorola."
B0791VS3N9,Steve M.,4,I am using this product as secondary smartphone as I have an apple as my primary.
B0791VS3N9,Jpxtian,5,Bought this phone to replace my Samsung Galaxy and I am impressed with the quality so much I bought another for my son. Easy to use and so much better than the Samsung. I would highly recommend this phone.
B0791VS3N9,Mark,5,"Better than iphone in my opinion, nice display and sound, and much much cheaper.
I wonder how I did not know it before."
B0791VS3N9,TimZ,5,"I'm very happy about this phone, it's very cost-effective. I just wish that its internal battery capacity is higher."
B0791VS3N9,Some Guy,5,"All issues w/ the company aside.
The phone works great and takes amazing photos/video"
B0791VS3N9,Miranda M.,5,"Loved the phone since the day I got it. I think it's super cool and trendy. You get all the perks of big market phones but cheaper. The quality of the phone is great. The battery life is amazing, and I just really enjoy the phone."
B0791VS3N9,L Z,5,It is rarely worth of my money to have such fast and smooth operation cellphone. This price was unbeatable. The quality was excellent.
B0791VS3N9,Michael,5,"If you are looking for a quality phone this is the one with a good price.
I am very happy with this photo and I highly recommend this photo."
B0791VS3N9,Nathan,5,"I got my old iPhone wet. Bought this to play Pokemon on my second line/account. I may abandon the cult of apple after using this phone. At the price point I thought it'd be equivalent to the tired old iPhone 6 I was replacing.... I was sorely underestimating this phone. Solid phone, fair price, and easy transition."
B0791VS3N9,Kindle Customer,5,I put my sim in and it went to work. Good color fast just a good phone
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"Will not allow download from Google play store on standard data, only WiFi which I don't have where I live! Took forever to transfer from my other Huawei phone only to be extremely disappointed."
B0791VS3N9,Joanne,5,"After trying the Honor 7x last month, I decided to return it due to sluggish operation, particularly with the camera, and went back to my iPhone 6s for the time being. I wasn't happy about it, but just not completely ready to cut the iPhone cord, I guess. When the Mate SE caught my eye, I decided to give it a try and it is definitely a keeper. It's snappy response has convinced me to retire the 6s for good, without looking back. Thanks, Huawei!

UPDATE 4/1/2018: Still very happy with my choice of this phone... it suits my needs perfectly.

UPDATE 5/9/2018: Received Android 8.0.0 update."
B0791VS3N9,the_Mike,2,"I only bought this because another brand lied about updating and they have a volume/sound bug they refused to fix. This phone is ok, it works. It's worth the money and I'd recommend it. Here's the problem and it makes the phone useless to my lifestyle. 1.) the front of the phone is curved. Glass screen protectors won't follow that curve and gunk will build up under the edge of the glass around the face of the phone. There doesn't seem to be any plastic screen protectors that would follow the curved edges 2.) There are no heavy duty cases. There are a few but they either look childish or they look like a truck tire. I had an Honor 5x and I know how delicate the screen and camera glass are but at least it had a flat screen. I can't carry the phone around unprotected, my only choice is to return it based on the reason there aren't any peripherals made to ensure my phone will last several years."
B0791VS3N9,Susanne Blackledge,5,Love this phone. Huawei out did themselves. Thank you. Looking at the newest phone released also ð¤
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,The screen is a nice size and the graphics are great. The price is also nice too. Overall good phone.
B0791VS3N9,Barb,5,"Great phone for the price, fast, decent sound, has a headphone jack! Good camera"
B0791VS3N9,daniel towns,5,This is a solid phone for the price excellent battery life too
B0791VS3N9,Benito Prieto Baumann,5,Almost as good as my Huawei Mate 9 but for a fraction of the price.
B0791VS3N9,MARYANN SHAFER,5,LOVE IT
B0791VS3N9,Mohammed Hanif,1,I bought this phone for my grandma. And itâs soo slow. Restart like thousands time already still slow as hell.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Awesome phone . Great price. Easy to transfer...super fast 4LTE. Recommend to buy. High quality
B0791VS3N9,GKC,3,Cannot install Micro SD if both SIM are IN
B0791VS3N9,Shequita,5,"I just got this phone week before last on Friday night. It works like a charm. If I were to accidentally broke this phone or lose it, God forbade I would buy it over again. It is very much worth it. Glad I made the decision to buy it."
B0791VS3N9,Leonard Sierra,5,Great phone vey affordable does everything Samsung Does! You can buy 4 for the price of one samsung

B0791VS3N9,UPENDRA CHALISE,5,"I love it! I have been using huwaei since long. This one is amazing! It's amazing phone at such a great price! I recommend anybody who is looking for good camera, amazing storage space and fast processor!"
B0791VS3N9,Angela R. Green,4,"I really like the phone. Great camera!!! It didn't come in the gold color which I selected prior to purchasing.

There was not an ""out of stock"" for this color so I expected to get the gold phone. Instead, I received the black. I was disappointed by this."
B0791VS3N9,Jamie Trego,5,"This phone is awesome! IPhone quality, picture is so vivid and clear. Fabulous price! would buy over and over again"
B0791VS3N9,george lazar,5,I love this phone .for what it does is under priced .
B0791VS3N9,Robert Montez,5,"I had no plans to buy this phone, it was something very last minute, and I am so happy my phone broke, which lead me to buying the Huawei Mate SE, because it is awesome"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,I love it and it's beautiful!
B0791VS3N9,D. Carper,2,"almost everything about the hone is great, but the fingerprint sensor doesn't work(almost like the setup app is crashing), and the system transfer refused to connect with my zte axon 7 mini. I did notice some oils on the sensor when i first pulled it from the box, i assumed it was from q/c testing. I'm going to reset the whole phone and try again, but if that fails i will have to get it replaced. I will update my rating/review once I know more.

edit: knocking of a star due to huawei changing the game(removing bootloader unlock ability) just after purchase. I was able to unlock mine but it hardly matters if there isn't any rom dev going on due to no cooperation from the manufacturer. add to this the lack of stock firmware downloads, and i certainly couldn't recommend this phone.

I may knock another star if im unable to resolve the flaky gps and nearly useless compass."
B0791VS3N9,Joseph,5,"Second Huawei phone, very affordable and does a pretty good job."
B0791VS3N9,Scittleeydoot,5,"I have two teen daughters with this phone.
They don't complain about the phone."
B0791VS3N9,Allen He,5,good
B0791VS3N9,Ari,4,"Why pay more when you can have something as good as any name brand for half the price! It's heavier than my old Moto and my Samsung but for the price, I don't mind, I will get use to it."
B0791VS3N9,David W,5,"I bought it for my father who is very happy for good picture, very quickly operate no need wait, battery can last whole day and still 40% left."
B0791VS3N9,Raushan,4,"A very nice phone for the price offered. The overall performance is very good and I am amazed with the phone. Highly recommended for people who want to have an awesome phone, low budget and use dual SIM features (if you travel a lot) ."
B0791VS3N9,TheJorgys,5,Bought this for my Mom as a new phone for Christmas. Delivery was fast and upon opening the phone box it was so nice and new. Everything worked perfect as soon as I put her SIM card in (ATT) service. The picture is so nice and for the price itâs a steal. Very good purchase
B0791VS3N9,HAPPY50,5,"Seems to be a good phone, it was one of the easiest changes to a new phone I have ever done, everything seems to be working as it should the only drawback is that it doesn't have 5 gz wifi but hasn't been a problem time will tell."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"For the price, it does exactly what I need to do. Bluetooth seems buggy but that's about it."
B0791VS3N9,TONY MILLEK,3,Didnât like overall very bad reception so returned
B0791VS3N9,Eric W,4,"It worked for a few months without a problem. good craftmanship. The only downside is the phone arrived without earpiece in the package. The standard package list shows the earpiece is included, isn't it?"
B0791VS3N9,lisa,5,"This Hauwei Mate SE... exceeded my expectation!!! For a first time buyer, i'm in love with it!!!! I got me the gold one...bought a few cases and screen protectors which enhanced her beauty! Now i'm good to go!"
B0791VS3N9,Breanna Nasser,5,Great phone! Especially at this price. Improved my reception as well!
B0791VS3N9,Andrew NG,4,Videoes saved in facebook album cannot be played. Not sure if it is hardware or OS.
B0791VS3N9,A. K.,3,"I purchased Huawei Mate SE with really big expectations after I read a lot of reviews online. But now I am returning it back to Amazon before one month is over.

I am not going to talk about the good stuff about the phone because the phone is really nice. I can say it's really a great phone with really spectacular features. It is really very much customizable, I can say it's much better than any other Android phones out there on the market as to customization perspective. But the phone has lots of downsides and I would like to inform you about these.

The most important problem I have experienced is that the phone's performance declined significantly within a month. The phone slowed down significantly. Sometimes it is responding like 1 to 2 seconds later and this is the most important problem to me. Especially when downloading something or running a few different apps it gets really sluggish. This is very annoying and the phone with these specs and strong processor should not easily be worn out like this. Warning: the processor is made by a Chinese processor company (Kirin), unlike most smartphones this phone does not have Qualcomm brand processor which could be the reason.

I also don't like the display which is not bright enough. The screen brightness is not good at all, it may be okay for the inside environments but when you're out there especially on a sunny day under the sunlight it's it's really not user-friendly even though you max the screen brightness...

Another downside of the phone is the data transfer. The reason I like Android phones because it's easy to transfer data just like plug-and-play or plug your phone into your computer and you can easily transfer data but on this machine you need to download Huawei application to your computer so that you will be able to transfer your data I have experienced that the phone keeps disconnecting during the data transfer. I lost data just because of that and I lost time...

Another reason I bought this phone was to use with my Cricket line and its hot spot but even though the phone is unlocked the hotspot service is not working with Cricket when I checked with Cricket customer service they said that they will get in touch with the manufacturer so the manufacturer will allow hotspot tethering which really sucks. This may depend on the carrier and I would highly suggest being precautious if you intend to use hotspot with this device.

I would like to throw a few words for the battery as well. I am a heavy data user and I can say Huawei Mate SE has a decent battery life. In my case, I was able to get at least 8 hours of battery life with lots of streaming and social media activities.

So like I said, I really like this phone but I'm going to return it back because it has a lot of downsides that really impacts my daily usage..."
B0791VS3N9,Steve Le Blanc,5,Switched from a iPhone 6 plus to this. I've been very pleased with it. No regrets.
B0791VS3N9,N.J,5,My mom loves it. Great fantastic buy. Low tier phone that runs/feels like an upper-mid tier phone
B0791VS3N9,Luke,5,Have been using for the past 3 weeks with no issues. Battery life is good and easily lasts a day. Camera is decent for the price. No lag so far. Great purchase for $230.
B0791VS3N9,phillip,5,"Very impressed with the build quality, camera, and performance. Highly recommend."
B0791VS3N9,Richard P.,1,"In this time and age im stock that a 2017 phone does not support new technology. If you want faster speed via wifi this phone can only pickup 2.4 wifi signal.
5G is the future this phone will not get you in the fast lane"
B0791VS3N9,Thomas,4,"Great budget phone that can hold its own standing next to a flagship despite lack of obvious features you might expect from a more expensive phone (lacks NFC, wireless charging & fast charging, and 5ghz WiFi). Otherwise, great phone."
B0791VS3N9,Holger Paulmann,2,"Device is slower than expected. GPS worked interminently after a couple of months and stopped working at all last week. Tilting works to slow, as does the rest of the phone. Price is very convenient, screen size is comfortable. Camera quality is worse than expected.
May be good for a little kid, but not if you use it for work"
B0791VS3N9,Chorizo,5,This phone is great. Much better than the honor I had.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,west of money don't work after few month of money don't buy
B0791VS3N9,Joseph Centeno,5,Fast phone. Nice battery performance. Really good choice for a limited budget.
B0791VS3N9,Nona E. Starr,5,"I love this phone, I had previous purchased a Moto Z and a Blu V, both were defective and I returned them.. This phone is everything as advertised and it WORKS."
B0791VS3N9,Jeremy,5,"Excellent quality, considering price-point."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,It's a great phone for the price really
B0791VS3N9,Christopher,5,Everything works great. No problems with operating on T-mobile network. Fast shipping and excellent value for the price.
B0791VS3N9,Rani,5,It's faster than any phone I've had previously and it's battery lasts me almost a day and a half. Picture quality is beautiful but sometimes it blurs. I haven't experienced any freezing in the phone and it's OS is extremely user friendly
B0791VS3N9,Dominic Benoit,5,best cell i ever own. use it in the caribbeans for 3 weeks and work perfectly. thank you
B0791VS3N9,Kevin R. Cope,5,Works perfect for me and ive had it for a while now.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"It very good cellphone I wish the screen was bigger, I Love it. I want bigger screen and faster one."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Great phone, really good performance, quick, good display and good camera upgradable to Android 8.0 haven't had any problems, I've owned one for about a year now."
B0791VS3N9,xiaoyao,3,"The cell phone is good, but two phone CARDS can't work at the same time, one card can't work all the time, so I still need to buy another phone"
B0791VS3N9,malte strauss,5,"I am replacing my old Samsung Note 3 which has well outlived its usefulness. This Huawei mate SE seemed somewhat of a compromise of speed and price so I decided to go with this phone. I did not realiize that it is so quick, responsive and easy to use. The screen is super responsive. The display is bright and clear. I would not be able to tell this from a top of the line phone and the price is amazing. Granted, my comparison is with a phone that has not been sold in years and barely works. But as a casual user this phone does everything one needs. There is no reason to spend more than three time the money on something that is equally outdated in just 12 months from now. Great phone with a huge display, thin profile an very good battery life. All the value and less fluff. Also the phone is not tied to the provider. Little bloatware..
Update: I have it now for a few weeks and use it every day off course. The phone is fantastic. The photos it takes are actually great. I like the fact that I can select the point of focus and the point to take the brightness of the picture. I can take decent interior real estate photos with it. Not 100 % as good as my DSLR with indirect flash but quite close. The lens is a good medium wide angle at around 28 mm (equivalent) focus length so you can cram a lot in it. But it takes pictures that don't look like they come from a phone. The bokeh function where the background becomes blurred and the subject is sharp works good and yield nice results. I did not expect the camera part to be so decent. I bought it with the thought in mind that I am settling for a bargain phone with a not so good camera. However, it allows me to do quite a bit more than with the old one. My camera bag stays at home quite a bit more. As a Realtor I can use this in a pinch and get great looking results that I can actually use without being embarrassed. (I hate when my colleagues use haphazard pictures that are done with a phone held upright where you can not see anything of the house) Compared to all the phones I had before, this is lightning fast and very responsive. I still love it. I completely love the price. Get this phone.
Update: I now have used it for about a week and love it even more. The battery life is incredible. When in a location with connected wifi the phone can last for about 3 days without a recharge. I presume the use of wireless data will cut down on the battery time a bit. But it is still plenty of time on the phone. This phone is incredible considering the really low price tag. Considering traveling abroad? It can take a second sim card and work both at the same time. Or have your work phone number and personal phone number routing to one device. I would not buy one of the flagship phones. There is truly no need since the Mate SE does everything one asks for an more. It even has a vault functions where you can protect your data and apps from unauthorized access. Good feature if you carry sensitive data or customer files on your phone. Also the ability to add storage with a sd card gives you affordable storage expansion. They even give you a cover with the phone so you don't need to get one right away. The thing I personally love it still has a headphone jack. Who ever complained about the presence of a headphone jack in a phone? Why are they gone in the most expensive phones? It does not make sense to not have one and deal with unreliable Bluetooth or cumbersome adapters. This phone makes sense in every way. There is no reason not to buy it. Did I mention that I love this phone? Best purchase I made in a long time."
B0791VS3N9,Sherry,5,"Really happy with this phone. Works great with dual sim . I live in Costa Rica , work in US.

B0791VS3N9,Mike Allred,4,"Great phone, great price for an Android device of this size with access to the play store etc."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon user,5,I bought this phone for my wife and she loves it.
B0791VS3N9,Allentown,5,"I brought this mate se and a honor 7 at the same time, no complains, just perfect."
B0791VS3N9,helkittyegg,5,"Decent device, and the price is great!"
B0791VS3N9,Gfry P Arbuckle,5,"It's the only phone on the market that's as easy on the pocket book, as so your eyes. The speed in which you can see the fruits of your labor."
B0791VS3N9,Judson B.,4,"Great phone. Headphones jack is iffy, only with my big headphones. My earbuds work well with the phone though. I think there's to much power needed to power certain headphones, so the phone doesn't work with the big (nice) ones. I'd buy the phone again though. Great value."
B0791VS3N9,Peggy,4,EXCELLENT phone!! Great deal for the price point! I wish the camera was better in low light.
B0791VS3N9,Brian Dawson,5,Never been upset with any Huawei products. Would buy again. Great buy since updated to Oreo update
B0791VS3N9,Stina,5,Best phone I've ever owned. Upgrading from a Note 4 and never going back to Samsung with their bloatware
B0791VS3N9,Forced48,5,I love this phone! You can't beat it for the price!!
B0791VS3N9,Michael,5,The most competitive product among others for the same price range. It satisfies all my needs for a cell phone.
B0791VS3N9,Will,5,Outperforms Apple by a mile at less than half the cost.!!
B0791VS3N9,naftaman,5,GREAT phone...No issues..wish had better speaker
B0791VS3N9,Ben Collins,5,It doesn't connect to Bluetooth to well
B0791VS3N9,Nebojsa D,5,"For the cost, probably the best phone you can get! Great camera, lost of memory, almost edge screen,long battery, reliable and beautiful phone!"
B0791VS3N9,LT,5,"I like this phone AndrÃ©s islas very Nice the packs, all islas beautiful, AndrÃ©s it's working."
B0791VS3N9,myexperience,5,Works very well and fast even though I have plenty of open apps. I'm very happy so far.
B0791VS3N9,Juan,5,Great phone for the price. Does much of what you would expect from a $400+ phone. Definitely recommend it.
B0791VS3N9,Neville,5,Love this phone. The quality of the camera could have been better but still gives you good enough take a good picture. Love the software as well which comes with a lot of features. The device is very snappy ....no hitches.
B0791VS3N9,thomas yeung,4,"The phone came to me perfectly fine, with the box scuffed and dirtied a bit but it was okay when I opened it. However when it came, there were no bubble wrap or even newspapers to secure the phone from moving around. Which could have potentially cracked the phone inside."
B0791VS3N9,Rhinin,3,"This could have been a fantastic cell phone:

PROS
1. Size - very light and thin
2. Clarity is great
3. Camera is great - good photo quality
4. Processor is fast
5. Price is great - I refuse to pay $1,000 for a cell phone

CONS
a. Major con - VERY FEW CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS! One font and one font size? Fewer options than my Ascend Mate II
b. Related to a. above, TWO CHOICES FOR SCREEN BACKGROUND! The choices result in poor screen readability
c. BASICALLY NO INSTRUCTIONS SUPPLIED WITH THE PHONE, AND WEB INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASICALLY NON-EXISTENT

I am not sure if these problems exist with other Huawei cell phones. With a few minor tweaks, this could be the best cell phone on the planet based on cost and value."
B0791VS3N9,Abi,4,"Battery does not last long, not sure if mine is defective. I turned off almost all background apps and the battery does not last as indicated"
B0791VS3N9,Robin Campbell,4,Poor signal with straight talk
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"For the price, it's fantastic. Does everything an $800+ name brand phone does, without all the fluff. I wish I'd been using this phone for years instead of waiting my money in Samsung and apple phones. The only bad quality I would say is the camera, it's not great, but for the price it's fine."
B0791VS3N9,Hugh Gallimore,4,"It was all I expected it to be , wonderful phone for that price. sound is very good, good battery life last much longer than other phones I have had would recommend it to anyone who wants to purchase a phone. One of the best phones on the market . The famous I phone has to work hard to compare with it. GOOOOOOOOD phone"
B0791VS3N9,Britteney Connard,5,I love this phone. The feel of it is nice it's heavy duty. And it's dual SIM. When I went to get it activated I got a lot of compliments on it and they said this phone is amazing
B0791VS3N9,Gustavus A. Aranda,5,Product arrived as described.
B0791VS3N9,lisha xiang,4,"I am not satisfied with picturing, else is good"
B0791VS3N9,Javier Lustgarten,5,I am happy with my phone. Thank You

B0791VS3N9,Wildflower55,5,Great phone at a great price. Takes awesome photos. Good speaker sound. Great size. I love my phone.
B0791VS3N9,Ðmazon Customer,5,Major major surprise! This is a really good phone.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"This is the best phone I have ever used. What a product from Hauwei. Please, if you have need of a good phone with quality performance, this is the phone for you."
B0791VS3N9,CAMILIA ELDIDI,5,I find it has all the features I need for quarter the price of an iPhone .
B0791VS3N9,Mike Carpenter,5,Ease of use and sized just right
B0791VS3N9,Melody Brown,5,"Great phone with an excellent battery life! The back fingerprint reader is astoundingly fast, as is the facial recognition. The camera is not the best, but you can't have it all for the price point. This is an excellent budget phone."
B0791VS3N9,Tom,5,I'm stoked. $237 for this? I broke my s7 edge which was truly the worse phone I've ever owned and was on a budget to replace it. I decided to change carrier to t mobile and take a chance on this bad boy and it was totally worth it.
B0791VS3N9,ET,5,"When I started working with computers in the 1980s, I never expected to walk around with 8 CPU cores, 64 GB of storage, and 4 MB of RAM in my pocket!

The price/performance ratio of this device is phenomenal, and it's a joy to use. The sound with Bluetooth and headphones is excellent (there is a headphone jack). There are few bloatware apps, and most can be removed.

The version of Android is not stock, but isn't annoying either. Huawei says the device will get Oreo in the future.

I am using this phone with T-Mobile in the USA and the call quality is good.

The phone can either take 2 SIMs, or 1 SIM and 1 microsd card. I installed my 128 GB microsd, so I have all of my music (ripped CDs) on the device.

I like that you can set up the phone to turn on with two taps to the screen. There is a step counter that displays on the lock screen which is useful to me.

Battery life seems to be pretty good. After fully charging the phone last night, and spending a lot of time installing software and configuring the phone, the next morning it's still at 60%. I even used the hotspot feature when my ISP had a brief outage, and I'm sure that uses a significant amount of power.

After charging to 100%, in the morning it was still at 97%.

The camera is quite good, but I still use a dedicated camera for photos that require a decent zoom.

May 13 Update:

I just received the OTR update for Android 8.0 (Oreo). The installation worked without a hitch, and Android 8.0 is running well."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Best affordable 2017 smartphone
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,"Is anyone having a problem on the touch screen? Its not that quick, have to press hard:("
B0791VS3N9,Tracy J. McNeal,5,"I love this phone. Hooked right up with my provider, quick, smooth, NO issues"
B0791VS3N9,CRAIG ANDERSON,5,"wow. Bought this to replace an s6. The predicted text is great. OREO. S6 fingerprint sensor stunk. This is great.
Best 250 I have spent. Saw some views saying camera is just ok. It as good ,or better, than s6. 16 mb. The volume on the headphones ( not included) is loud. Came with case, but will upgrade. Pic is great.
THIS IS A DEAL, WOULD BUY AGAIN.
CRAIG
UPDATE. I took a video. It was flawless. But there is no video editing option. That would be great. The text msg froze up twice. But I just closed the background apps. I think it was a software glitch, not the phone. The fingerprint reader works great, unlike my s6. It was lousy.
To sum this up. Still a great phone. Oreo 8.0
Fyi. Hope this helps, Craig"
B0791VS3N9,Karla,4,"The battery last 1 and a half day. I watch movies and series, its sound is good as well. The quality of the pictures is not the best (front cam is low quality). Finally, I think that something is wrong with the software because it does not rotate properly (just when I expand the video in YouTube or Netflix)"
B0791VS3N9,Joe Z,5,Good phone for the price
B0791VS3N9,Bruno,2,"Phone speakers are poor quality. It is very hard to understand the other person on the phone. Sometimes the volume ranges from can bearly hear the other person talking, to can hear okeyish, still not good, but only if I push the phone hard on my ear. And no, I do not have a hearing problem."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Excellent phone. Great speed, camera quality and fingerprint sensor. There is nothing better for the money."
B0791VS3N9,Hardware Traveler,4,"First impression, this is a thin and light phone. Screen is bright, performance is fast, not much junk loaded from the factory image. The setup gives you a way to move data and apps from another Android phone to your new phone.

Camera is good, phone has a fingerprint sensor. The OS image is not too far from a stock android version. The Sim is a nano site, and the tray for the Sim can hold either a second Sim or a micro SD card to expand the storage. This phone is both carrier unlocked, and comes with a US warranty.

Few negatives, does not have a knock code capability. Screen icons look pretty crappy in landscape orientation. Battery is sealed in and not replaceable similar to some other phones.

(Update) after using the phone for a few weeks: Battery life is great, my LG would be at 25% after a day of running around and moderate usage, the Mate SE is still at about 65% battery.

Other issues noted: The PIN code on the lock screen does not have a scramble option, which would be good to have again. A couple of little issues noted: 1) one time turning on the phone with the power button, the digital clock display did not show up. 2) In my email app, the screen started showing a blue color tinge. I restarted the phone and the issues have not reoccurred at this time.

Overall my impression is still that this is a very good phone for the price."
B0791VS3N9,Sunshine,5,"The camera is the bomb!!!!! Any chance I get I would be taking selfie, lol. Better than my Samsung S5"
B0791VS3N9,patrcia greenwood,5,After trying to figure out how to it in 2nano sim cards that was the worst part but now I love the phone now
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Very good Phone so far, average battery duration 2 days, good photo quality, so fast to use it is awesome.. i been using samsung galaxy s8 but this phone is similar or even better. i love it."
B0791VS3N9,Tim Bope,4,This is a great phone. Easy to setup. Solid feel. Samsung should take notice.
B0791VS3N9,Marisol PÃ©rez,5,very good phone and camera more
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Great Phone! You will not be disappointed at this price-point, best budget phone available!"
B0791VS3N9,paul2d,4,"Let me start by saying that I am not a phone snob. I am not trying to impress anyone. This phone has almost everything I want and provides me with all the functionality I need. It is essentially an Honor7X with upgraded RAM and storage making it equal to the Honor7X released in the rest of the world outside of the US. It has a decent camera, Android 7, 64GB storage, and duo SIM and unlocked for travel. The fingerprint sensor is nicely placed on the back and I don't have to struggle to find it. The battery lasts me for 2 to 3 days depending on my usage (I am not a heavy user). I use it a lot for Spotify in the car and for my home audio system and it works well. It is lightning fast at boot up and loading apps. I find it to be great value. My cost was $229 US. I had considered the new Samsung A8 (2018) but it only had 32GB memory and I felt that it was overpriced at $429 US with the only advantage that I could see for the Samsung product was being IP68 water resistant and protected against dust ingress. Could have done without the bloatware. Some people will dislike the lack of a headphone jack but I only use Bluetooth so it is not an issue for me. Support for NFC would have been a plus. Essentially a great phone and aÂ Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked 5.93"" - 4GB/64GB Octa-core Processor| 16MP + 2MP Dual Camera| Grey (US Warranty)great bargain."
B0791VS3N9,cece,5,"great cell phone, photos are better than iPhone"
B0791VS3N9,Bigred25929,5,Not the best phone ever made....but great for the price point!
B0791VS3N9,JTSolano,5,I had a Honor 5x. I bought this phone to replace it. Great specs for the price of the phone.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Great durable phone
B0791VS3N9,Interact,5,"Easy transfer (takes time) of older phone apps etc. Essentially a mini computer on steroids, Just ordered another version for my spouse., to replace her Samsung."
B0791VS3N9,appletree,5,Excellent phone. Light weight. Fast response. Good performance overall.
B0791VS3N9,Mina,4,"If Yu are looking for a simple phone, this is not for you.
Lots of settings to be tweaked... If yur a geek like me, fine.
Very very decent for an entry to mid level priced device. I however am VERRRRY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CAMERA'S POINT & SHOOT ABILITY. CLEAR DETAIL ? Not really. All of the Ravings about the Camera must have been from people who are not very picky... I need Very good Clear Images.
However, The Post Edit abilities are very decent, but who has all that time ?

This being said, the battery hold out is impressive, general abilities of the device very much up to par, and the addition of an SD card helps for images + videos, games, etc. For 229$ you cannot go wrong.

From all the reviews, I expected much better Camera performance.
If I am missing something, PLEASE Let me know!

SINCE PURCHASING... 1.31.19...
I Have downloaded a Photo App I used years ago:
""Photo Editor by Dev Macgyver"" for Android. Paid Version. Meaty App if you are not Savvy, but can be EZ if you
Use + Need BASICS -
-High Resolution with Cropping (resolution greatly reduced with installed app !)
-Colour
- Brightness
Etc.
Overwrite and the image
is saved as most recent
pic (unfortunately). But,
you can save in many
different files.
Hope this Helps."
B0791VS3N9,Shots,5,"I was originally considering the Honor 7X, then I saw this device with twice the RAM and an extra GB of RAM. After a week of use this device has been amazing. The screen is beautiful and responsive, all the apps I want to use work well. I am by no means a mobile gamer, but I do frequently use audio apps (Ex: EDJing Pro) and they work very well on this device."
B0791VS3N9,Frankie,4,"Tldr; Great phone for the price. Do not buy for the camera, it has terrible performance!

Let's make this quick.
Pros- The phone is very snappy. Responsive and just a joy to use.
- Screen is great for the price. Feels soft for typing. Decent for videos and zoom is nice for widescreen.
- Allows you to use MOST of the stock Android apps with full support.
- Battery is quite awesome. Processor is fast and efficient.
- Mostly a stock experience after changing a few settings.

Cons- CAMERAS are excessively bad. I can't stress enough that you should buy a different phone if you want a good front and back camera. These are so poor in performance it's kinda sad. Oversaturated, poor auto focus, horrible white balance and exposure settings for auto. Even after trying to install 3rd party apps as well as Google's own camera. I came to the conclusion that the sensor is just grainy and dissapointing. My 3 year old Nexus 6p worth 4 less megapixels takes better photos just cause it uses Google's image processing.
- Huawei's ROM is pretending to be Android iOS it's pretty lame but easily fixed.

End: Glad I bought it totally going to buy one for my dad later in the year."
B0791VS3N9,aimee,5,I didn't mind switching from my prepaid Verizon to prepaid at&t in order to use this phone. I got a cheaper bill better coverage and an awesome phone .
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I've had this phone for almost a year now and it still works great. No lagging or screen malfunctions.
B0791VS3N9,Catherine,4,Bought as a gift...
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,Amazing phone. Bought this to begin an iPhonefree life. This kills the iPhone i had indeed. 4 stars for the micro usb instead of C-type.
B0791VS3N9,Juan Vargas,5,What I expected
B0791VS3N9,Richard Mayo,5,Great phone! Quickest finger print recognition ever! Love the panorama camera.
B0791VS3N9,Matthew,5,"Love the phone. Fast, responsive and great picture quality. The sound could be a little better but for the price fantastic."
B0791VS3N9,David A Welsh,5,Just as good as an $800 phone if not better
B0791VS3N9,Vito,5,This phone is fast and battery last forever... i charge it every second day. Not bad for a Chinese company they are coming on strong
B0791VS3N9,Tot,5,Great product at a cheap price.
B0791VS3N9,Laura,4,"I love it. It's fast, the camera is crear, takes beautiful pictures. The only thing is that the bluetooth has a los of problemas, At least in my country."
B0791VS3N9,P M John,5,"Awesome phone for not a lot of money! Speedy, great screen, all day battery life. Overall a very quality phone. At this price you can buy a great midrange phone yearly and still come out ahead compared to buying the next Iphone or Samsung. My biggest gripe is the camera which struggles a bit in low light."
B0791VS3N9,Danny,4,I love love this phone. But I've only had it for two days so keep that in mind. I am a former power user and used to spend the big bucks to get the latest phones but my last Note just quit turning on and I knew budget phones were becoming more accepted in the U.S. so I did a little homework and got this one. The only downside is that it doesn't support 5 GHz WiFi but I am willing to live with that. 2.4 GHz is still everywhere and my home router supports both spectrums. For hundreds of dollars less I am willing to make the sacrifice. No payments to spread out with the phone company is awesome and the performance of this phone is great. I don't play graphics intensive games on my phone.
B0791VS3N9,Jorge J. Yanez Diaz,5,The specs are amazing for the price. Huawei is a reliable brand. The battery last one day even with 1 to 1.30 hr of gaming or day an a half without gaming
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Wife loves it.
B0791VS3N9,William C Kingrey,5,Very good phone. The best thing is the amount of memory and the quilty of the phone for the best price. Will buy this product again.
B0791VS3N9,rich terry,5,nice build quality
B0791VS3N9,Quan Li,5,Amazon customer service is definitely the top line. Phone is lovely. definitely worth it.
B0791VS3N9,maigua,4,Excellent
B0791VS3N9,Kragster,5,"Just Plain Impressive! Leaves my old Samsung in the dust, outshines my early Mate 7."
B0791VS3N9,2323,1,Don't like it
B0791VS3N9,Tanisha,5,Perfect for everyday use
B0791VS3N9,David Valentine,5,"It's a great phone, no complaining."

B0791VS3N9,seychelles10,5,Great phone and it updates frequently and with a lot of storage.
B0791VS3N9,J. Hernandez,5,Great device.
B0791VS3N9,Ramon Stewart,4,Not a bad phone at all. Battery does charge a bit slow for my liking and my headphone was missing but all in all a good device.
B0791VS3N9,J. Banos,5,Lv the phone and the price
B0791VS3N9,danbbat,5,I really like the phone. The price was in my wheel-house and it has the amount of memory that is perfect for me. Easy to use and set up. The more I use it the more I'm learning about the features.
B0791VS3N9,Alicia St.Cyr,4,"A great phone comparable to Samsung.
Excellent camera photo quality is remarkable.
I have tried Samsung S7 and S8 and have had problems with the motherboard under one year so I have invested in this Huawei and have no regrets...Value for your money and much more!"
B0791VS3N9,eunsoo oh,5,"Probably the best value phone i've ever seen. The camera is great, i love the fingerprint sensor, the display size is perfect. I'm still a bit suspicious about the whole Chinese government stalking people through huawei phones but other than that conspiracy I love this phone"
B0791VS3N9,Robert G Payne,5,The best camera easy to use and beautiful
B0791VS3N9,Denny Le,5,Better than my LG n Sony phone. Like it so much bought mom n wife one...
B0791VS3N9,Sofman,5,"Great Budget phone!
Pros: Long Battery Life, great look and huge screen.
Cons: No fast charge, Camera has some grainy pictures."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Holy crap!!!! The battery life on this baby is amazing.
Normally listening and streaming music on my work shift will take my battery from 100% down to around 20%. With this device, the same 9 hour shift, I walk out of work with just under 80%. Loving this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Just Another Shopper,5,"I added a wireless charging receiver that I bought on Amazon for $7-$8 and used the clear jelly case that came with the phone. Now I can charge it in my car or at home without wires.
The calls are clear, the camera(s) are great and battery life is long.
The fingerprint reader works better than I expected. I had a Samsung s6 before and this is many times faster.
A large screen was one of my requirements, so that I wouldn't have to put on reading glasses. This is just right for me.
A couple days after turning the phone on, it downloaded and installed Android 8.0 (Oreo).
I highly recommend this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Doug Roberts,5,Great phone! Everything about it works as well or better than the flagship OnePlus 3 phone I bought two years ago at twice the price.
B0791VS3N9,jrn,4,"Strong build . Average sound volume, decent picture quality... recommend as a good budget phone .. video buffering and camera are ok.. giving 4 stars since volume is just ok"
B0791VS3N9,Chris P.,5,"This has been one of the best Android phones I've ever owned. I've had minor issues with Bluetooth audio stuttering, but other than that this phone is just as good as the high-end flagship devices from Samsung, LG, or Motorola."
B0791VS3N9,Steve M.,4,I am using this product as secondary smartphone as I have an apple as my primary.
B0791VS3N9,Lepidopterous,5,"Paid 191.92 for the gold, so yeah I missed 190.00 . Excellent phone."
B0791VS3N9,Jay Warren,4,Love it! Picture quality at times change but clears up. Fast processing!!!
B0791VS3N9,Oscar Ynsfran Mallorquin,5,Powerful cel reasonable price
B0791VS3N9,SHANTELL M. POWELL,5,"Shipped super fast. I like the phone, it is handy and it is very nice looking. Great phone, no problems."
B0791VS3N9,charles,5,Just what I needed.
B0791VS3N9,Pen Name,5,Great price. Quality seems more like a really nice Samsung. No issues. I like using this more than my iPhone.
B0791VS3N9,Randy Sajovic,5,"Had this a few months now and very happy with it. It updated to Android 8. The camera works good enough. Finger print reader very fast. So glad that Motorola did not offer their 64 gig g6 in the USA. Got this instead and for the money, an excellent phone."
B0791VS3N9,Jeff,4,Cheap and good
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I love the phone. This ia a good buy you won't be disspointed
B0791VS3N9,R.C.,5,OK quicksilver ! Great running system.
B0791VS3N9,Jack,5,It works just as good as the one cost over $1000.
B0791VS3N9,CCTrue,5,This phone is amazing. Battery life is exceptional. One can add apps and they don't slow the phone down. The price is good as well for a phone that ordinarily would cost a lot more.
B0791VS3N9,Jimbo,5,Nice phone with plenty of features.
B0791VS3N9,kevin,4,"A little aggravating at times to navigate compared to Galaxy s6 I had but for the price its tough to complain about. Its probably my phat fingers and the way I am always rushing things anyway.. LOL Pretty damn good phone for the money, I can tell you that"
B0791VS3N9,Bill Porter,5,"Sound is tinny, and some areas of the touch screen along the edges seem to be not sensitive enough. Overall, though, I love the phone."
B0791VS3N9,polymorphism,5,"Super fast, two cameras and latest operating system for 200+ dollars only. Best budget phone I can find in the market!"
B0791VS3N9,Vinny,2,"The phone looks great, has a good screen, excellent battery life, the camera is good, but the main thing I use my phone for is tracking with Strava, and other GPS based apps for kayaking and hiking. The phone has let me down every single time I've tried to use any GPS intensive app. It's basically a tablet now that sits in the house connected to WiFi. I've numerous tricks online to fix the problem, and it persists."
B0791VS3N9,Johnma12,5,Great phone! it will be best to have better screen solution!
B0791VS3N9,Sheldon Noray,5,Huawei did it again
B0791VS3N9,Miranda W,5,"Love this phone, good product, good price."
B0791VS3N9,tippytaylor,5,"very satisfied, a learning curve but worth it!"
B0791VS3N9,Highly Rated,5,"One of the best from Huawei. Fingerprint the best and the fastest I've seen all this years. The phone itself is super fast, above standard camera, long lasting battery, smooth operating system, just name it. For the price? Go for it without a doubt."
B0791VS3N9,VRA,4,"Nice responsive phone, but I returned it. I am accustomed to plain android on nexus type devices. The EMUI interface feels old and clunky"
B0791VS3N9,Jing Ran Chen,5,"Decided to get the white/gold version after much research and am VERY satisfied with the purchase. Absolutely gorgeous phone at a bargain price for its specs. Functioning seamlessly so far, even comes with a clear TPU case."
B0791VS3N9,Brenda,4,What I like about this phone is that it's great style and quality for a affordable price. My only complaints which are minor is the screen sharpness could be a tad better and the phone likes to heat up a bit under heavy use.
B0791VS3N9,H. Jamil,5,"Big screen, excellent performance, easy to use, cheap but looks expensive."
B0791VS3N9,Zahra Aryan,5,"Initially, I had concern whether it is really unlocked or not. My sim card is T mobile and with LTE network it works excellent. Excellent image quality. Excellent design. I got it on time with all accessories. I recommend it to others as well."
B0791VS3N9,Geena,5,I love this phone for the price
B0791VS3N9,Nikolai,5,Good phone. I like it. It makes amazing photos and video.
B0791VS3N9,Mohamed,5,Has so many features and extremely responsive. It has also face recognition and allows some of the social media apps to connect with 2 accounts at the same time which is an excellent feature if you have more than one account like me.
B0791VS3N9,Wilfredo HernÃ¡ndez,5,I don't like the low volume and vibration intensity.
B0791VS3N9,Elkhan,4,"It looks nice, works fast, but sound volume is too low even in max settings... But the music volume is surprisingly high and good enough."
B0791VS3N9,Abdoullahe B.,4,Itâs good item I love it itâs fully unlocked
B0791VS3N9,Francys,5,"The only thing I don't like very much of this phone is the camera, I believe that's because I was used to the camera of the p9, this phone is perfect, it runs smoothly, the display is very good, you pay less than what you get"
B0791VS3N9,Kandi,5,Haven't had any problem. Love the size and it's a great phone for the price.
B0791VS3N9,Tigerbawls,5,Great phone...camera is okay
B0791VS3N9,curtis haynie,4,"Over all this product is amazing, great camera quality, nice overall look, ex. But I have to give a warning to customers who want to buy this phone and use it through the network of verizon, verizon unfortunately does not work with this phone."
B0791VS3N9,turbines,4,Phone works just fine but I found transferring old data and apps from old buggy Moto G4 Plus impossible using Phone Clone app. That was likely Motorola problem. I didn't like many of the pre-installed apps and removed or disabled many of them
B0791VS3N9,Pattengale,5,Amazing phone. Great price!
B0791VS3N9,Laren Elmenhorst,4,It only has the 2.4 MHz bandwidth which isn't favorable and the camera could be better but all in all I am very pleased with this phone for the price. Lots of space and good screen.
B0791VS3N9,MIKE SUTOR,4,"good value...nice phone...get a case, it's rather slippery to hold"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I didn't know what to buy LG Stylo 4 or this one, good that I pick Hauwei mate se more ram and storage"
B0791VS3N9,zerro,4,very good
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"With the 4GB RAM, I can open many app at the same time and didn't feel any speed limit. The camera is great."
B0791VS3N9,M. Seidle,5,"Totally satisfied. This phone is fast, compatible, takes great photos and is very well put together.
Best parts: Blazing performance, beautiful screen, camera, headphone jack and battery life.
Worst parts: Micro USB.
Overall: Strongly recommend."
B0791VS3N9,Madhu,5,"Good product but not tested/support for Fitbit watches.
Night mode photos capture is not good.
Good process speed,build quality is good
I tested internet speed b/w I phone XR vs Mate se....both will perform at same speed..."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Can't ask for more with this phone, looks great and is well built. So far had it for 3 months and no complaints. This phone can challenge Samsung for its build quality."
B0791VS3N9,Fiorella N,5,Very good

B0791VS3N9,shan,5,fixed
B0791VS3N9,Mikayla,1,I had a strong wifi connection all day. Internet and Google Play never worked properly.
B0791VS3N9,hermitmonk,5,Very nice choice when you have a limit budget.
B0791VS3N9,jianweiliang,5,"I switched from IPhone 6s,because it always lose signal in my office. Even I have one bar signal I still cannot make a phone call. When I got Huawei Mate SE, it gets 2 bar or 3 bar signal. No signal issue. I already use it one month, it works great!"
B0791VS3N9,tigerspaw,4,This is a quality phone. Fast processor and plenty of storage and RAM. I have not use the camera.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Good everyday phone. Treble rom capable so it is easy to personalize the OS

B0791VS3N9,R. CHEN,5,works well.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Great phone I'm not really a camera person but the quality is great. Everything about it is nice my favorite feature is the finger print scanner
B0791VS3N9,Victoria,5,"Love it. the camera is great, and the sound is loud and clear. Best unlocked phone at this price."
B0791VS3N9,Fang Wu,5,I bought this unlocked phone to replace my broken iPhone 6s plus. This phone has a very similar performance to iPhone 6s plus but a much reduced price. I have recommended it to my friends!

B0791VS3N9,Diderido,5,Love the phone
B0791VS3N9,rjewell,4,"I was in the market for a mid-range phone, I typically don't invest in expensive flagship phones as being in the construction industry, the more expensive the phone, the faster it seems to break, I had a ZTE grand x4 for roughly the past year and a half, and while it did everything I needed it too, I was just wanting something a little more and a little newer with more storage, I was looking at the xiaomi mi a1, but it didn't appear I would get lte wit at&t, and was also looking at the Motorola g5, but seen a g6 was about to be released and didn't want to wait, so I saw this phone while looking at unlocked phones at Best buy, but they didn't have any in stock so I ordered it from Amazon, and it was 20.00 cheaper. So far it's a great phone, and my only complaint is no USB C and fast charge, something my 70.00 ZTE had. I ordered a magnetic charge cable that should arrive tomorrow and that will hopefully take care of my dislike for micro USB. Lol. But the phone feels quality, the camera is decent, and the screen is beautiful, and has some neat features. I would definitely purchase again."
B0791VS3N9,Anazel,5,"I just love this cellphone, pictures are stunning. I don't have to charge it very often and when I do, it charge super fast. Not complaints at all. Love it!"
B0791VS3N9,Michael Christy,5,Wife loves it so far. Great camera and battery life.
B0791VS3N9,Anthony NJ,4,Handles everyday test very well most games I throw at it surprisingly smooth unit rarely seems to be hot under heavy use. An awesome mid-level phone that 90% of the users would be more than satisfied with.

B0791VS3N9,Sherry,5,I like this phone and would buy it again.
B0791VS3N9,Mathieu Audette,4,Only two cons : The camera is not good and the battery is average. The rest nothing to complaint. The screen is realy nice. The phone is fast with a good finger sensor.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,This phone truly has 4 G networking..... not like xiaomi A1 only got 3 G
B0791VS3N9,carlos,4,"In general, I would say is a good product I was surprised by some of the features of the phone"
B0791VS3N9,Ryan Rice,5,"Amazing, amazing phone. Same quality as a $1,000 iPhone X for 3/4 of the price. Huawei has a repeat customer in me, as this is my second phone with them and I will continue to buy their phones as long as they're around. 10/10 would recommend to everyone"

B0791VS3N9,Stanley L. Fleischman,5,"I've had this phone for about 9 months now and couldn't be happier with it. Als, it is much less expensive than other cell phones of the same or lesser quality."
B0791VS3N9,Candie,5,I bought one of these for me and one for my husband. We both love them.
B0791VS3N9,Silvia O,5,After many years of the over priced iPhone I purchased the Huawei Mate SE and absolutely love it! Easy to use and the convenience of not having to use iTunes. Huawei will only work with AT&T or T-Mobile (GSM).
B0791VS3N9,Royal_Saiyan,5,Amazing phone with tons of great features and performance. Then for the price it's well worth it.
B0791VS3N9,jason,5,great phone!!
B0791VS3N9,Brian T. Kinney,5,"Great phone no problems great battery life,dislikes nothing"
B0791VS3N9,michael,5,This product is like buying a Samsung Galaxy phone

B0791VS3N9,Olga Fedorova,5,Thank You. I have no complaints
B0791VS3N9,yolanda grant fulford,5,my previous was a Huawei. I like the upgrades. but other had a bigger screen
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"I did not care for the quality of the pictures. Other than that I liked the phone. However, I had to return it because I did not get good reception on T-Mobile in my area."
B0791VS3N9,sammy,4,"This would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for very important flaw. That flaw is that I sometimes my phone doesn't receive calls or when I call others that they don't get the call. So I have to sometimes use WhatsApp for calling others to make sure they get the call of they don't answer using TMobile or have others call me using Whatsapp if I don't pick up to make sure my phone rings. This is the same problem I had with my Huawei Honour Phone. I called TMobile and they were saying Huawei phones sometimes doesn't work on their network. I love the phone for watching videos, surfing web, etc. This phone is one of th best values with it's specs for phones at least a $100 more... hopefully some update fixes this problem."
B0791VS3N9,hamid safdar syed,5,Amazing phone.........

B0791VS3N9,Theresa Stopyak,5,Dollar for dollar the best phone imaginable. Camera and speaker are just ok but everything else is terrific.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I haven't seen anyone mention this but aside the excellent performance and how beautiful the screen is, the touch response is what really make this phone shine in my opinion. It makes general navigating and typing a joy as each touches are registered instantly when your finger makes contact to the screen. Although the speakers can use a little bit for the improvements, this is a BEAST of a phone at this price."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Excellent...Quality...Great Price!
B0791VS3N9,Melinda Fprrester,5,I will never get stuck in a contract again this phone blows away anything I've ever had including my Samsung S8

B0791VS3N9,HorseMonkey13,4,"Amazing phone, and value, for it's price. However, after having it for not even two days, the puck that plugs into the outlet no longer works. It's upsetting, but luckily a puck from any other phone will work."

B0791VS3N9,xdpsn,5,"I honestly don't know why anyone would spend $900+ on a flagship when these are available. I used to have Note phones (admittedly, it's been a while had Note 1,2 and 3) and this phone gets it done. Operates smoothly, has intuitive features and looks good."
B0791VS3N9,Phocks,5,Best phone I've ever owned. Works with Net10 through AT&T aim wonderfully.

B0791VS3N9,Caitlin Parker,5,"Very nice phone for a very nice price. Runs great! Huawei has a great app to copy old contacts and messages, etc, to your new phone from the old. I've never had one of these apps work so well so fast.

My phone came with a case as well, which is really great! Only complaint is that I wasn't aware I'd need a sim ejector tool to get my SD card and SIM card into the phone, but that can easily be replaced by a paperclip."
B0791VS3N9,TED STOVER,5,A lot of phone for the money-- seems like a high end phone- as good as my daughter's and she paid lots!

B0791VS3N9,Renan Vieira,5,Worth it! Just the camera could be better
B0791VS3N9,David Filimon,2,"Phone is quick, responsive, fluid. Bad part I have come across so far is bad reception in my home. Had a honor 5x prior to this, and never had issues with that phone, so this is disappointing seeing that it is imperative to phone function..."

B0791VS3N9,armando sandoval,5,this producto very fast excelente
B0791VS3N9,Mr. Anderson,5,"I am a US T-Mobile customer and my last 2 phones were:

- Oneplus 1 for 2yrs
- Oneplus 3 for almost another 2yrs.

Both were purchased directly from the Oneplus website, not Amazon. I loved them both. After recently breaking my OP3 I was was devastated to find out that my insurance was not able to provide a replacement phone only a refund, which sounded ok at first (I would just find one here on Amazon). Since I could not afford the price of the new OP6 (just released), I re-purchased a new OP3 from a seller here on Amazon. To my dismay it was an international version and could only receive 2G speeds from my carrier due to the Band range. So after returning it, I found this gem for $150 less than my OP3.

For the last 4 years I have enjoyed the use of phones that were on the pricier side and manufactured by a startup company based out of China. I did my research and Huawei appears to be making phones with great parts for low prices. The total price I paid for this phone was almost $270 total with tax. That is a lot of money to spend when bigger companies like LG and Samsung have nice phones for $200, but their quality is not quite as good Overall (Screen resolution, camera quality, internal storage and RAM that the Mate SE has for $250).

I would recommend this phone for US GSM customers that are comfortable with paying $250 for a $400 phone. With all that said, this phone has a solid build, great specs, and a happy customer."
B0791VS3N9,duc,5,A great phone with affordable price.
B0791VS3N9,Crystal Holbert,5,Best phone I've ever owned!

B0791VS3N9,sp,3,"Still on v7.0. Sound quality is ok. No complaints for the price of the phone but Huawei could have done better. No complaints on picture. Compatibility issues on some apps. Did not run into issues with Apple, Nexus or Xperia phones. My preference is that Huawei should make it clear which phones are upgradeable to the most recent android version and those that will NOT be. Check out the Xperia or Motorola unlocked phones. A bit more but better. My first and last Huawei brand."

B0791VS3N9,veronicalexgm,5,"For the price is a awsome phone, really fast and good"
B0791VS3N9,C,5,Great phone.Owned 5x 6x and now the mate. Don't listen to hype this phone is not a budget phone. The extremely few places that this phone has had corners cut on are no different from any brand of phone. The 7x did have major software issues but the mate see fixes those and adds a little extra oomph to the deal. No matter what two phones you compare ones not going to add up to the other somewhere. But Huawei has offered a phone three times it's value with a fair price tag.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I am happy with my purchase. Great battery life. Lots of features that I am still discovering.
B0791VS3N9,Nicolas Diaz Lalova,5,very good choice!

B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"This phone was just something I ran across online while I was phone shopping. And then I watched about 10 reviews on YouTube along with the Unboxing of this amazing phone. I liked what I saw and ordered it. OMG when I got it and set everything up and started using it I found so many features that I never dreamed of. This phone is all that and then some. No complaints at all. Thank you Huawei.. The best phone and the best brand I've never heard of.

B0791VS3N9,David Kassi,5,Very good cellphone
B0791VS3N9,Ertorb O'MalMolcHerghie,5,Very good for the money.
B0791VS3N9,A.L.L.,5,"Works with T-Mo. No issues with getting 4G LTE connection. Talk and text working perfectly. First ""unlocked"" phone I've ever had and the transition couldn't have been any more easier. Just had to run to the T-Mo store to get a new nano sim card because my micro sim card from my old phone didn't fit (didn't even know there were different sim card sizes now).

Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that was crapping out on my 5th battery after 3+ years, decided to go with this for the screen size at the price mainly. All the knocks on this phone are things and features that it doesn't have (that other phones have as a standard), but if you didn't need it or use it before then chances are you probably won't know it did not exist. It does everything that I wanted my Galaxy Note 4 to do, but faster with double the storage and a nicer screen. I'm already impressed with the battery life but I'm sure that will degrade over time. Still getting used to this version of Android and GUI but it looks neat.

My first new mobile device in over three years and I couldn't be anymore happier and impressed especially because of the price. Great bargain if you're looking to upgrade and catch up with the times, haha."
B0791VS3N9,Samey,5,I liked this phone its very good quality until now no any problems

B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,"This is good phone but I'm sure you might like the essential phone more. The camera is ok but not as great as product reviews make it seem. Zoom sucks, low light photos suck.
But I think I could forgive all that if the phone was actually gold like I ordered.
The ""gold"" color is actually rose gold. Very obvious pink hue. Had I known I would've just got the silver one.
The ui is really nice tho. The phone is super smooth. Just an FYI the lockscreen wallpaper cannot be changed which is kind of a bummer"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Only drawback is it doesnât come with headphones

B0791VS3N9,DGH44,5,"This is a beautiful phone. There is no need to pay the outrageous prices for the tier one phones. The Huawei Mate SE Is a great phone for most of us. Yes, the expensive phones have features that the 2 to 3 dollar phones don't, but not enough to make 7 to 8 dollars difference. I am very happy with this phone. Very fast, nice size screen. All the bells and whistles I need. Would recommend it to the average user, which most smart phone users are."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"I like this phone a lot. I've had it for less than one week. My previous phone was a google / motorola nexus 6.

Good:
Screen is very nice and bright
Battery life is incredible. will last me two days when my old phone needed charging during each day
Camera is amazing. Front camera is as good as my old phone's back camera
Comes with a nice clear case

Bad:
Touch sensor is not great and sometimes registers a tap as a swipe. I wonder if this is a software or hardware problem
Form factor -- 2:1 aspect ratio is weird and unusual for android. There's a special button to tell the system to stretch the screen for each app. It has worked in every app I've pressed it, but it seems weird. It's also hard for me to reach the whole screen with one hand.
Spyware is factory installed.

I usually like to mod my phone and get root and install custom roms. This phone I haven't even rooted yet, but I still leave that open as a possibility. The built in ROM is quite nice it supports themes including dark mode. I've been using DNS66 to block ads. It works ok, but some sites still show ads. This phone doesn't have a section in XDA yet but the previous model (Honor 7x) does and the development is progressing slowly. This phone is bootloader unlock able and root able using the same procedure as the 7x. Today Huawei released Oreo beta for honor 7x in US and I assume that will come to this phone too.

Overall I'm quite happy with this device and I think that it's pretty good. I hope that Huawei / Hi Silicon release information about the CPU and camera allowing custom kernel and ROM development."
B0791VS3N9,Fannie F.,3,"This Huawei Mate SE is much nicer and more sophisticated than the Honor 5X. The problem I have for both phone is the operating system taking too much space. The Mate SE Firmware used 12 Gigabyte plus 3 GB for other when it was just shipped. After the 1st software update, it still used 8 GB plus. My Honor 5x is the same way. It has 16 GB and the Firmware used almost 6 GB plus 2 GB for other. I keep having clean up files and delete photo in order to keep my honor 5X running. I am having doubt about how the operating system used up that much space (8 GB plus 3 GB for other?). I am not sure if other brand are the same way."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"Edit: This is legitimately the worst purchase I have ever made in my life. 3 months after arrival the phone is completely unusable, as it fails to recognize sim cards. It is completely irrelevant how good the warranty is, how the company treats customers, and everything else. If your product is completely nonfunctional in 3 months you need to do the world a service and get out of the market..

Beware. Even in protective cases expect this phone to last a month before the screen breaks. I dropped it 10"" while in the case to have the screen shatter. After sending it to Square trade, and having it come back as good as new, it immediately went back into the case, and has developed a new crack in the screen, without being dropped at all. This in the month since it was returned to me. All in all a beer average device by performance, but Jesus it's more fragile than a soap bubble."
B0791VS3N9,Sach,4,Best phone for money

B0791VS3N9,Ronnie,5,Amazing phone
B0791VS3N9,Ray,5,"I am liking this phone so far. It was easy to setup and has most of the features I need. Since it is unlocked, I was able to use my existing nano sim The WiFi is limited to 2.4 but I knew that ahead of time. I imagine this is why the phone stays cool and has a decent battery life. The phone is light but has a large screen. I love the fingerprint scanner as it allows me to setup multiple fingerprints to unlock the phone. Very pleased so far. Sound is decent but not loud enough. Let's hope it lasts 2 years. If it does, I will have gotten my money's worth!"

B0791VS3N9,Dennis,5,"SO far, so good. I've only played with it using the WiFi connection, but it was a great thing that once logged into my Google account, all the apps started loading, and I even made a couple of calls using Hangouts Dialer.
I only got the SIM for it activated an hour ago: Let's see how much adjustments it takes me to go from Windows Phone 8.1"

B0791VS3N9,ubest,5,"battery is great. Sorry Huawei won't do NA promotion anymore since Trump's trade war. Very great product for the price, That's perfect transition while we are waiting for wireless 5G available in 2019. Don't buy any expensive phone now since 5G will be a big deal. no phone is going to support it since the technology is still in developing stage not finalized yet. China has tested 5 G wireless, download speed is up to 10 Gbps. one HD movie download will take less than a second."

B0791VS3N9,robert gozza,5,exactly as described
B0791VS3N9,alfredo c.,5,Really good. OVERALL
B0791VS3N9,Ralph,5,"For this price, this phone can not be beaten. I'm done buying $800-$1000 phones. Budget and mid range phone have closed the gap considerably in the last year or two. This phone is fast, the fingerprint sensor is insanely fast and accurate, storage and RAM are crazy good for this price. And it's unlocked so you're not tied to a carrier. Can't say enough good things about this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Yulmin Es,5,Great phone
B0791VS3N9,Braden Jageman,1,"Despite what Huawei says in the Q&A, these phones do NOT work on the Virgin Mobile network. Thanks for lying to your customers and wasting our time..."
B0791VS3N9,Eugene Matavitski,5,"Was very nervous about ordering this product, yet brand is very popular in Russian Federation and many other Russian speaking countries. Phone has great battery life, very common features, and is easy in setting up. Slightly heavy in weight, but comfortable to hold in a hand. Comes with clear semi-soft case. Back and front camera and video is amazing quality. If I would know before about this brand, I would never spend crazy money on other lg/Samsung/blackberry phones. Extremely pleased with product."
B0791VS3N9,Sebastian Ortiz Castro,5,Great so great !!!!!
B0791VS3N9,Clarence j Gatling 3rd,4,First of all what I don't like..1. No 5 gigahertz Band Wi-Fi 2. The phone is not quick charging there for about 2 and 1/2 hours for a full battery 3. The speaker's average-at-best 4. The camera you better have perfect conditions 5. The phone is kind of heavy especially coming from my idol 4S.. Pros everything else ! my rating I will give it 7.5/10 I would give an 8.5 but 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi means alot to me my $40 Moto E4 has 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi but this $225 phone doesn't
B0791VS3N9,Keith,1,"Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this purchase. Can't believe of all the great phones on sale on Prime Day 2018 this is what I have chosen. This phone makes calls with the lock screen activated. While in the car, the music won't shut off and restarts every time the car goes into drive or is turned on even if there was no music playing when the car was turned off. The camera is poor as is the sound quality. Disappointment reigns supreme. If it doesn't change, this phone is headed back quickly. I have had cheaper (Moto 5) and much more expensive phones (Samsung Galaxy Edges) but this ranks at the bottom of them all. I am clueless as to all of the glowing reviews as my experience is so diametrically opposed. I hope things will get better but hope grows dim."
B0791VS3N9,Giovanny Portillo,4,"I bought this phone and I had used it for a few days now. I Will name some of the Pro's and Con's based on my opinion:

Pro's
*Excellent battery, I finish my day with 20%
*Fingerprint sensor is super fast
*No laggy OS

Con's
*Really not the best camera. Do not buy if you like to take lots of pics. Also, videos are really bad.
*Screen colors are Pale and I totally dislike that because I had a LG G4 and the screen was better. If you had an Amoled phone before, then don't buy it.

I will add more while I continue to use this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"Huawei phones are totally under the radar. I upgraded from an Honor 6x I've had for 18 months - I loved that phone. Battery life on Huawei phones is incredible. The Mate SE looks and feels premium, hits the 80/20 rule right in the sweet spot. Screen resolution is not as high as a phone like the LG V20 I also bought for comparison, but the Mate SE is lighter, sleeker, and has much, much longer battery life. EMUI is a good overlay - fairly iPhone-like without losing the Android experience."
B0791VS3N9,classyweb,2,"I was trying to replace my 2 year old OnePlus X with Huawei Mate SE. Mate SE packaging was cheap, but when opened the phone, it looked gorgeous. It really makes impression of expensive device. However, there are few things that I didn't like, so I had to return it:

1. Performance. Comparing to my old OnePlus X, Mate SE is slow. When I used it for a day, it was kind of OK. The next day, it was so slow, so it took 1-3 seconds to respond to my tap. I had to restart the device and then it become tolerable but still not fast enough comparing to OnePlus.
2. Size. The devise is bulky and heavy.
3. Screen glare.
4. Speaker and sound quality. It sounds very cheap.
I would recommend this phone to people who transition from cheaper phones. People who have more expensive devices will not like this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Suzanne,4,"This phone is amazing in so many ways. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the notification light in the upper right corner is so tiny you can barely see it. The other thing I don't like is that you must use the same notification tone for emails and texts. I've never had a phone where you can't have different sounds for the two. Pix are amazing, storage is good. Works just fine for me."
B0791VS3N9,Atlantico,5,I'm loving this phone. One nice thing is that it did not come with a lot of bloatware already installed. The other reviews cover all the technical details. I just want to say it is a very easy phone to use and is much cheaper than other large format smart phones.

Comparing to the spec(4GBs ram, 64 ROM), this phone is so cheap.
I used it for 5 days now.
It is still smooth.

The camera quality is 8/10
I like HDR mode in this phone.
You won't regret to get it."
B0791VS3N9,Shani Dror,1,"I dont really used the phone, cause I was unable to connect to my home wifi.
I found its is known problem of other models of this company, so I return it."
B0791VS3N9,davidnicol22,2,The phone seemed pretty nice at first but now when I try to make a call I get a popup saying I need to enable VoLTE to make calls. There is no option to do that so now I have an essentially worthless phone. I can't find any tech support regarding this issue.
B0791VS3N9,Wally,2,Good overall phone with one giant negative. This phone will not connect to Wi-Fi 5g. This is a big deal as the 2.4 band is loaded and makes your internet slow and will not stream without buffering.
B0791VS3N9,Jane Nguyen,3,"I went from a note 3 to this and felt like it was a downgrade.
Pros:
Price
Touch sensor

Cons:
touch screen does not seem as responsive as my note 3.
Camera only shoots great under perfect lighting.
Speaker is sub par"
B0791VS3N9,Jamiyla Narinesingh,2,After about two weeks of having my phone the speaker is very muffled and full of static can barely hear anything when on loud speaker or when playing videos etc.
B0791VS3N9,Manuel J.,2,"Phone works fine. I enjoyed using it for gaming and daily usage although, screen is not bright enough. Speaker was loud but at high volume it explodes. However, after 2 weeks of usage the speaker started having problems such as: staticky, and when put on high volume it explodes and after observing it the speaker started weakening and i couldn't barely cant hear anything. I called Huawei support team/warranty department and it was hard communicating with them since they are based in china. They told to me to factory reset my phone every time the speaker stops working. After factory resetting it worked but who would buy a phone that needs to be factory reseted every time something goes wrong with it? . Don't get me wrong the phone is nice and performance is fine. Speaker problems though is a big ""NO, NO""."
B0791VS3N9,Jason R. Grinstead,4,"It's affordable, it's fast, it has a great camera for the price, and the screen is big and easy to read. I've had zero problems with this phone, and only a couple of small caveats that led to not quite making that fifth star. One is a lack of support for 5ghz wifi (a major oversight for a device released in 2018), and the other is that Huawei has discontinued their bootloader unlocking service. They didn't just discontinue it, they lied about when they were ending the service, having announced an end date.. the week after they took down the site. So, if you were hoping to play with custom roms, this is not the phone for you.
Beyond that, it's performed like a champ, and still manages to make it through a day with decent charge, and in my use case, with the murderously battery-draining apps I need to keep loaded on it for my job, that is really saying something. My previous phone, a Blu R1 HD, was at 20% by 6pm, this baby is reporting in with 55% at 10pm.. There's also no dreaded sudden yet silent loss of connectivity requiring a reboot on a daily basis that's so common with chinese phones, either. It's perfectly reasonable to expect 10 days or more of rock solid up time."
B0791VS3N9,Sebastian W.,2,"I've used several budget phones. This one was a disappointment. It was slow, logging, poor camera, issue with convertering photos to MMS massage etc."
B0791VS3N9,Corpsecrank,5,This thing is absolutely nuts for the money. Fast no lag and everything I use runs fine on it. The HiSuite software that you can download for it allows you to text from the PC while it is connected. You can also easily backup all your stuff using the software even import export your texts etc. I can't get over how much you get for the money. This thing even runs super cool even with the bulkiest case available for it. I used this thing all day without a charger and only used 9% battery too and that included watching some videos on youtube and everything. This is one smokin phone and definitely holds it's own against current flagship models out there.
B0791VS3N9,pavelrg_66,3,"Great design, remarkable battery life, nice screen, friendly OS, also came with a transparent cover.
Now the bad one: the camera . Specially in low light conditions, blurry, difficult to get a right focus and for sure noisy pics. At the day light you take maybe a little pale images, like washed colors, when you zoom in, the sharpness it's not that good . Have a manual mode in order to take the manual control over the pics, but really, who have time to set all that taking a casual pic? Others phones do this job with great results instead this one.
It's a sad point to this device"
B0791VS3N9,Umesh A Tol,2,"Although it is dual SIM phone, one of the SIM didn't have service. Either of the SIMs worked individually but not together. Reset the phone twice, but couldn't make it work. Otherwise phone is okay."
B0791VS3N9,Kaylee,5,Fantastic phone. You get what I would consider a flagship level phone for a fantastic price. You can't go wrong.
B0791VS3N9,Brendon Domrose,5,great phone for a great price. Nothing bad to say yet. I have had it a few days now. Works great on Cricket Wireless.
B0791VS3N9,Kathy ( =,3,"I love this brand but they seem to have the same software issue for most the phones, before this phone I had the Nova. Certain earphones don't seem to register unless used with an extender, and me, I use my earphones every single day for work so it's just too annoying for me. I have looked online for a solution and there are other people with same issue but no solve. Overall this phone is great, but just for the earphone jack issue, I am returning and purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S8 instead."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I am loving this phone . I found out the brand is chinese I dont ever too like chinese brand phone but so far it is a pretty good phone the battery life so far is very good 8 hours plus
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,2,"I was so excited for this phone after doing through research for hours.
Set up was very easy, everything looked great...Until I opened the camera on Snapchat. I was in a lit, indoor environment, and the picture quality was grainy and low quality. The actual camera wasn't an improvement from the one on the app. This goes for front and rear camera. It was like I was transported to 2010 with the awful quality.
This low quality camera is a total deal breaker."
B0791VS3N9,Nigel Tobigat,5,Love this phones.. Works excellent with MetroPCS.
B0791VS3N9,Angel,3,I like the way the phone looks and the fact that it's fast. For it's price it's a good phone. It's camera quality is not the best neither is it's sound. It also doesn't have NFC.
B0791VS3N9,Dawg813,5,Nice phone! Update....now has Android 8.0 update... awesome!
B0791VS3N9,The Truth Man,4,"Initial Review: Huawei Mate SE looks, feels and performs very good. I like it very much. It is worth more than the price I paid for it. I will chose it anytime over the other expensive phones."
B0791VS3N9,April Lee,5,"This phone is great. A lot better than most Samsung or Apple phones that cost 400+ dollars. It runs very smoothly. The camera quality is amazing. Although it does take a long time for it to fully charge (it takes about 2-3 hours for it to fully charge from 10 percent), the battery lasts very long."
B0791VS3N9,Ricardo,5,Love this phone have to return it because my bluetooth wasn't connecting
B0791VS3N9,Carmella Raiford,1,Just received this phone last week b/c my other Honor phone had issues and now I can't believe I'm saying this but my phone just blew up sitting here at my desk at work. SHOCKED is beyond what I'm feeling. I have faith in this company and love the Huawei phones but idk... I'm a little hesitant now.
B0791VS3N9,Wayfinder,3,"Powerful phone, fast. The OS takes a whopping 14 gigs of space, leaving only 50 gigs free of the 64. The claim of 5.93 inch screen is only true if one includes the control panel. Actual viewable screen size (according to screen measuring software) is only 5.6"". The screen does not have the look or feel of a true 6"" screen. Does come with a case, which is a nice touch.

A shame it doesn't have induction charging. That would have been nice on a phone of this quality.

Was advertised as Android 7.0. When I turned it on almost first thing it did was update to a solid Android 8.0. Hurrah!

Annoying factor: despite the fact it has very accurate fingerprint-login recognition, every 3 days it requires entering the pin number. This can't be changed, it's not an option, it's hard-wired into the system. BAD HUNWEI. I suspect someone in design department trying to earn his wage with ""new idea""... and missed the mark. It doesn't imrprove security, is an annoyance every 3 days, and NO CUSTOMER WANTS THIS, right? On that point alone I knock this down an entire star.

Watermark issue: the CAMERA app may come in default mode to stamp a Huawei logo blurb on every photo it takes. To fix this, go to settings and un-check the ""Watermark"" option. (Personally, I can't imagine why Huawei would believe any customer would want their company logo on our photos. What were they thinking?)

Major drawback: A customer reports turning on Wifi and Bluetooth at same time causes a major bottleneck. Something to be aware of if you regularly use a Bluetooth headset. Another star knockdown.

I am very impressed with its wifi speed. I wasn't aware until recently that different Android devices can have higher or lower wifi download speeds. This phone significantly out-performs every other Android device I've used in sheer speed of wifi downloads-- including my high-cost Android tablet.

Overall I'm quite pleased with this phone, with a couple of annoying exceptions. Yes, recommended."
B0791VS3N9,J. K. Daar,5,Great phone so far!
B0791VS3N9,Jason B.,5,"What an amazing phone for the money. I've seen a number of reviews saying it's a great phone within it's price range, but it's great phone regardless of price point. I've had high dollar, big name phones, and I like this phone better than any of them. Very impressive and we'll thought out phone."
B0791VS3N9,M. B.,5,ok
B0791VS3N9,Davi Rodriguez,4,"Very nice phone, however the only thing I disliked was the lack of a 5ghz connection. Since I use bluetooth headphones and 4G signal is my house isn't great it made videos on youtube a nightmare."
B0791VS3N9,katie jones,4,It works well and it's cheaper. A lot of apps that work on the big brands just don't work on it.
B0791VS3N9,Daniela Imperial,4,"I phone, i was a Samsung s7 user and this phone is just as good (or verter) at a lower priceo, super fast, great display, i use a lot of apps and the phone keeps running fast and smooth, good camera with fun features. I really recommend this phone"
B0791VS3N9,ROLLANDA LEWIS,5,"cricket pops up she says oh wow I didn't know, haven't had any problems with this phone."
B0791VS3N9,Ivy Richards,2,"Nicely made phone, good materials. But BEWARE!! Navigation does NOT work. You cannot get around.

Research it, itâs common accross all of this brand of phone. Hopefully google/China fixes it. But beware , you cannot use GPS!!!

Otherwise, solid phone."
B0791VS3N9,Yogi,4,"So far so good. Camera, at least during dat time is excellent. The buttons at bottom are a little small. works fine with my TMobile."
B0791VS3N9,A. H.,4,"Liked it, but couldn't use it in Japan, at least not with my tele company."
B0791VS3N9,ElJuezJubilado,5,"I have had the phone for about a week, and I love it. Everything is fast including the camera and fingerprint sensor. I like the quality of the photos. The phone is a little on the heavy side, but not too bad.

The one really disappointing thing for me is the battery life. I cannot get through a full day with even moderate use. I have put it on battery saver mode, made sure no apps are running in the background and made whatever other setting adjustments I could, but the battery life is still poor. I recharge once during the day for a while, and it is OK. However, I don't think I should have to do that. I am not sure if the battery is a general situation, or if I have just received a bad one.

Update 4/2/18: company emailed me about ways to increase battery life. It worked. The battery is now great, and so is this phone, probably the best I have ever owned! Dual sim is awesome. I live in Costa Rica, and need both Movistar and Kolbi for complete coverage."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"Love the display and is nice but heavy battery.
Has 2 problems;Bluetooth wont work and display wont stay for longer than 5 seconds.

otherwise 5 stars ,but having trouble ."
B0791VS3N9,Jose M. Perez,5,Amazing phone with excellent performance for the price.
B0791VS3N9,Tolorunshagba Samuel Tade,5,Nice phone. But no headphone
B0791VS3N9,Korven509,5,This phone is worth it I love it battery last the OS clean and with good tools and this is the basic not that mate 10 the wow that blew my mind that high price mate 10 must be a beast even this mate SE feels great I advice u to buy a shock proof case just like I did there's tons of cases good prices im just glad a waited a lil cause I almost bought the honor 7x that extra ram and storage is worth my money
B0791VS3N9,LAURA,4,"I am a bit frustrated with the imposibility of using any bluetooth device to play de fm radio. Even though i use a cable as antenna, when you try to reproduce it via bluetooth either in headsets or external speakers...you cant. A shame."
B0791VS3N9,yanc,4,"quality is great, speakers are loud, user friendly. DOES NOT COME WITH EARPHONE, NO FRONT FLASH, TALKING ON THE PHONE IS A BIT LOW. Layout menu is similar to Apple. phone is fast, keeps charge"
B0791VS3N9,Angel Ramirez,5,"Why spend $800-$1,000!!!!! This it's absolutely speechless, the best performance, the battery awesome, and the camera it's just out of this world. Highly recommend. And don't make the huge mistake of spending lots of $$$$ in supposedly a high end phone while this phone will save you hundreds."
B0791VS3N9,Arielle Jordan,5,Great phone for a great price.
B0791VS3N9,Xur,5,This phone is amazing for the price. The only thing I don't like is the picture quality.
B0791VS3N9,james,5,Hands down the best phone under $300. Mind you this phone is very comparable to iPhone 8. Def worth the buy.
B0791VS3N9,Avi,2,"It seems to be built well (good screen), however it is underpowered lacks a gyro scope, aptx and 5gz wifi."
B0791VS3N9,R.S. Studios,5,"After having this phone for a few days now, I can say I'm very pleased with it. I owned a Moto X Pure which was a Motorola flagship phone and the Huawei Mate SE is lightening fast in comparison. I was a little nervous about the form factor being 8:9 but the phone size fits comfortably my hand. Also, After owning the Moto X Pure and having great sound quality with the two front facing speakers, I was afraid the Huawei Mate SE would pale in comparison. Well, I was surprised that the one speaker has pretty good sound.

The only con is that the phone has very few choices for cases and screen protectors. Even it's sister phone (Honor 7X) doesn't have a quality two piece case available. I did end up getting a Skinomi screen protector and a Spigen case. They are adequate for now.

UPDATE: Huawei support says Oreo (Android 8) available first of May, 2018 for Huawei Mate SE.

If you are hesitant to buy this phone, DON'T BE! I think you will be very pleased with your purchase."
B0791VS3N9,Scarleth Montalvan,5,Huawei Rocks!!!
B0791VS3N9,Antonio Echavarria,4,"Well so far , the phone is working very well, i did no give a give stars because i thought it include the headset but is not, at list i did not received it."
B0791VS3N9,Choose&Chase,5,Excellent product and working great
B0791VS3N9,Cody Nguyen,5,The best phone you can buy for $200 bucks! It performs like my s7.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,"Been using it about a week. I will update my review if anything changes.
UPDATE 4/14/18: So something else I don't like is the brightness problem. Regardless of whether you turn on/off the auto brightness, certain apps will dim when used. So my home background and google search or some other apps are all bright but when I open my chrome browser, it gets very dimmed. Only way is to up the brightness to full but that also means everytime I come back to other apps or home background, its so bright. After using EMUI for about a week right now, I find more errors than more convenience. This dimming problem and not getting gmail notification are really starting to get on my nerves. So I had to take one more star away.

I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a good phone under the budget. Everything runs smoothly and camera is actually better than I expected and overall, I can't really complain much because of its great price. However, as someone who has to stay on top of my emails and such for my work, it gets frustrating because getting a notification for my gmails is hit or miss. I also don't get notifications from certain apps but I don't care as much as I care for my emails. I tried looking for battery optimization setting and trying to see if I can excempt it from battery saving etc but no option such as protected apps on this system. Notification is a big, big problem for me and probably lot of people who depend on their phone for work. Other than that, I don't have anything that I dislike about this phone as of yet."
B0791VS3N9,uofa314,5,"This is the best phone for the price that I've ever had. It seems like flagship quality, for $230."
B0791VS3N9,Aaron Christensen,5,"I have owned this phone a little over a week and can't say anything but good about it. Runs smooth like a champ. All apps are quick and snappy, including games and social media. 64 gb storage and the extra money for 1 extra gig of ram and double the storage was worth it to me. 4 gig ram also allows apps to run quick and even when multiple are running its quite fast. 4g lte is also a great bonus, although it's expected in most smartphones these days.
Battery life is also very good with its close to 3400 mAh battery. I can be on it all day and still have about 30% by the end of the day, given I would run it for 8 to 10 hours straight. The phone is larger than other phones I have owned and some may feel that the screen ratio is strange. I however don't mind it being a bit taller and slender. Some people are worried that because it's not a flagship phone that it won't perform and that is not the case. Fingerprint scanner is very fast and responsive. The camera is mediocre to say the least but what can you expect from a phone that doesn't break the bank at only $229 dollars. Also, for those who are worried about ""spying"", Huawei is just a company trying to make money like any other. I highly recommend this phone to any who were on the edge about purchasing in the beginning as I was. It is a fantastic product."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,Nice phone with high quality look! Few minor problems so far but liking it overall
B0791VS3N9,Francisco Javier,5,SÃºper bueno. SÃºper recomendado. 5/5
B0791VS3N9,Bernard W. Peck,5,Good phone with solid camera at a good price. Has a 3.5mm headset jack and an FM radio
B0791VS3N9,Mikey,2,"Do not buy this phone if you need the dual SIM functionality - it doesn't work. With two SIM cards in the slots, only one SIM can be active at any time. The other SIM will be inactive (no signal) and cannot receive calls or messages. I spent an hour talking to Huawei tech support and they confirmed this is the case. You will need to manually go to settings to select the SIM card that you want to make active. This makes the dual sim feature practically useless. Very misleading advertising."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,Incredible phone!!! Do not buy an expensive phone. It's a waste of money. Don't be a sheep. Get this phone. It's got everything you need.
B0791VS3N9,Jc,4,Well only the audio is not very good the calls are not heard well
B0791VS3N9,Diego,5,Buen producto!
B0791VS3N9,Harold Liu,5,"Great phone, good deal. Designed for America. Very different with Honor 7X"
B0791VS3N9,MrSept,3,"Pro -
Overall good built, smooth scrolling, responsive
Con -
Strong magnetic interference caused my speakers to crack loudly while 2 feet away so I would imagine that it's not healthy keeping it in your pocket. And I had to return it because it does not support wifi calling which is a must for me because there's no cell signal at my house so I can only make/receive calls via wifi."
B0791VS3N9,jon,1,Bought 2 of these phones and my one phone has had terrible speaker quality from both speakers since the beginning. Now I can barely hear anything from the earpiece speaker. Local phone stores can't find replacement parts for it I don't recommend this phone !! Mine has become a paperweight in only 3 months time
B0791VS3N9,ceci,5,Es muy buen celular relaciÃ³n precio calidad excelentes
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I like it so much so powerful, it so premium looking and using phone!"
B0791VS3N9,Vuyisanani,4,"great, the phone arrived early and exactly as is."
B0791VS3N9,Alejandro Carbajal,5,Nice
B0791VS3N9,picky,1,"This is the 9th day that I played with the phone and tried to make it work for me. But it could not work out.

I bought this phone out of curiosity and good reviews from Amazon. I was excited when I opened the box. I liked the hardware design of the product. But the SW is not there. Here are a couple of examples of bad bugs or design features that are troublesome for me.

1. The data transfer from my old Nexus to this phone needed to go through the cellular/hotspot data path instead of WiFi or other low cost means. This was the first surprise. Fortunately, I only picked up a couple of small items to transfer. Otherwise, I would have exhausted my data plan for the month without completing a 3rd of the transfer.

2. the icons in the app groups is way too small to see.

3. way too many meaningless settings for me to play with to get the phone to a point that I like it to be.

4. the camera is not able to zoom in in viewfinder mode (being referred to as ""portrait mode"" in the pop-up message when I tried to zoom).

5. There are a couple of Huawei related things such as ""Huawei share"" that I don't even want to try.

6. when I viewed pictures from my Google drive folder today, the pictures darkened themselves to a point that I can hardly see what's in the pictures. I found no way to change that behavior.

The item 6 above is the last straw that made me decide to return this product. I am not sure of what other surprises I will run into down the road. Enough and no more Huawei products. I am going back to Moto."
B0791VS3N9,Luis Zaera,1,It came defective and they did not want to give me a replacement
B0791VS3N9,victoria,3,Mybhusband doesnt like that it cannot set the sleep time. It only keeps it about 10 seconds then the screen dims. We would send it back but we've had to send several items back to Amazon and it's such a hassle for us. If he always keeps his finger there the screen won't dim otherwise it's a good phone.
B0791VS3N9,Bob9292,1,"Bought this phone on March now is may. Phone gps is stop working at all. tried to use it with all apps. called to Huawei customer supported go over on all tips and steps they peovided, nothing worked phone still doesn't catch gps and catch aignal. So after talking with 4th specialist which Huawei transfer for my understanding they are out of country because of heavy accent and very hard to underarand. Long story shoet, spoke with manager of their replacement department, she gave me only one option. 1 i need to take picture of the phone and issue. 2 send phone to them, they will test it which will take 5 to 10 business days. I wasn't agree with their only options, I asked loaner phone while they will be testing my phone, they said they don't provide any phones or replacement so I have to be without phone 10 days, while someone else might be testing it. Huawei are you crazy? In modern world for grown man being without phone. So ended up getting samsung, please stay away from this phone compant. It cost cheap but u won't get any help or service if u needed. Also battery ia not good either. No fake no lie, very upset about this brand. Never again."
B0791VS3N9,Edgar Sosa,5,"This phone is quite nice, I bought this phone for my wife, she doesn't use it as much as I use my own phone (Galaxy S7) but for what I saw it's quite impressive, works great, doesn't lag, takes great pictures and it has nice looks and best of all is cheap, my wife loves her phone."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,My phone flexed in my front pocket and the screen cracked. The honor 5x had a more robust screen . Also. My headphone jack doesn't recognize when it's plugged in. I really want to LOVE this phone. But these two unfortunate circumstances make me regret my decision
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,2,"cons:
-no WiFi calling ( thats a huge one for me since i live in an area with bad cell signal
- USB is whack (it isn't a type c USB)

Everything else on the phone is great but the first point is really a deal breaker for me so there you have it"
B0791VS3N9,sadie,3,"Heavy phone. Font to small, even though made as large as it could go. Fit bit charge HR cannot connect to this phone,, phones fault,, not Fitbit. Researched this phone,, should have checked more thoroughly. It's an ok phone."
B0791VS3N9,Diana,3,I bought what was advertised as a S9 on deal days.... however it is not what was shown as purchased. So not much of a deal considering I paid normal price. This was a gift. So i shall see how it works out
B0791VS3N9,Amanda Duhon,5,I just got my phone in a hour or so ago & I can't wait for it to finish charging so I can make sure everything works out great on it!!!
B0791VS3N9,Shinu Moses,4,"Phone gets hanged when Bluetooth is switched on. Otherwise its a great phone. Phone is really fast and camera quality is too good. But it looks like dual camera is fake, I tried covering one of the cameras and it was not blocking the view. But still picture quality is good."
B0791VS3N9,Brother Bill,1,"Do not buy this if you plan to use it in China. 4G is not working in China and there is no way to fix it, CPU chip is different. So you can not get on the internet using cell phone signal. I bought it before my China trip and found out the hard way. Now I can't even return it because one month period is over."
B0791VS3N9,Kamran Shah,3,"It's just a bit heavy, but not bad for the price your paying"
B0791VS3N9,george kouspidis,1,Did not include earphones
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,"So this is a fast phone with a great screen, but there are issues with using the phone with Android Auto when listening to music. If you use the bluetooth connection (phone unplugged from the Display Audio System), the sound is great, but plugging into the phone into the car's Display Audio system causes a degrading of the sound quality. Several other phones I have didn't cause this, including a Nexus 6P and Google Pixel XL and Samsung S8+. For this reason I returned the phone."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,2,The phone is ok but it takes very long to download pictures and videos
B0791VS3N9,Alex Dominguez,1,"Stay away, phone is useless when you have Bluetooth on."
B0791VS3N9,cynthia,1,the internet and data flow is really really really slow. The phone is slow too.
B0791VS3N9,Michael C,1,"No android auto compatibility, kind of a bummer for an android phone.The online support is extremely talented at telling you it will work with the next update, going on a year brand wide. You may not need android auto, but just know they don't have your back if something else happens. Bluetooth gets spotty beyond 20 inches. The phone looks really good."
B0791VS3N9,Kaustubh Joshi,3,"I ordered two, one for my wife and me.
I like the stock like UI and experience of android and hence NOVA launcher is the way to go for me.
But with NOVA launcher going I am facing software bugs, I am not sure if this is because of the nova launcher or a bug within the Huawei version of the android.
When I place a call, for half of the time, I get a message saying 'Call not sent' while the call is already in progress and connected to the network.
The lock screen sometime shows and sometimes doesn't show the global clocks, its a hit n miss
The Huawei weather widget won't show in the list of widgets, it might only be working with the Huawei skin, but still...

I believe the root cause might be a bad integration of NOVA laucher with the Huawei skinned android version or Huawei's reservations with people using launchers in their phones. They do have a warning which warns you about instability of phone with 3rd party launchers.

But then I don't think that's how an android phone should be."
B0791VS3N9,me,1,"Beautiful phone and you'll think you have the best hardware/software for the price. THERE IS A REASON FOR THE LOW PRICE. I am pretty sure HUAWEY is aware of this phone's issues and that's why they have other products with similar hardware/software, like the HUAWEY mate 10 pro, at $579. This phone is defective and has very serious signal problems. I understand it uses the same antenna for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. You can use only one at a time, you won't know it but you will realize it because of the miserable speed when using Bluetooth. It will not connect to Wi-Fi 5G!!!! Mostly no problems with calls and messages, but video will degrade constantly and images will become completely blurred. This is above ground! I am in NYC and am used to the intermittent signal service in the Subway, as it is only available at the train stations. All my prior phones, including my last Huawei HONOR 5X, worked fine. They would pick up the signal as we approached the station, go full signal at the station and would start losing strength as you move away from the station, but you will be able to connect! This phone is really, really bad at it (horrible really!). You may be at the station already, it would show full signal and 4GTE but it will not connect, it will be frozen, it will not open any pages. Sometimes I go through four or five station before I have a response from the phone. I thought the phone was malfunctioning and got it replaced. Same issue with replacement. I sent the second back to Huawei, I don't know what they did, but phone still the same and never heard from Huawei again. If you only use this above ground for calls and messages, you will like this phone. If you need to use it for the internet or streaming, this is not what you want, and in situations similar to mine, like the subway system, this one really sucks and in case of an emergency underground, you don't want to be caught with this one. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, IT APPEARS TO BE FACTORY DEFECTIVE."
B0791VS3N9,Elaine,1,"According to At&T representative, this phone is not compatible with At&T visual voicemail. Only standard voicemail is available. I'm happy to update this review if this problem can be addressed. Otherwise, AT&T users should definitely pass on this device."
B0791VS3N9,Ella Belle,3,"Not sure how to rate this phone as i have not even unboxed it. It seems I will need to return it as no providers in my area will support it. Also, I just found out about the UK and US ""supposed"" security risks which possibly affect this phone.

I got so excited about this phone after reading all the good reviews. I was delighted to be able to get it for $219.99 on Prime Day. Now I see that this phone has stayed at that price, so I should have not have felt so rushed to order it on Prime Day.

I needed to actually order the phone and have it on hand so I could check the box sticker for the actual IMEI numbers to check with my local providers for compatibility. I am in a very rural location and sadly it appears no providers in my location can offer service for this phone.

I hate to have to return it unopened, but if providers in my area will not support it then my only other option is to send the poor little phone back. Very sad to have to do this! Oh well... I gotta do what works for me. I am glad so many other people are very happy with their new phone. All my research says it is a great one."
B0791VS3N9,Jessica L,1,Terrible battery life.. I love Huawei phones and I loved this phone but the battery is so bad that it's just junk. Makes me sad. Could of been an awesome phone.
B0791VS3N9,Nastasia Banton,1,Wonât connect to Wifi
B0791VS3N9,Jon,3,"Didn't hate this model. But bought as an upgrade from HONOR 6X (which is GREAT) but despite the additional RAM it was super slow. Basic low graphic games would delay. Over all, sound not as good as 6X nor photo (but I am not big on sound or pictures)
WANTED TO LOVE. Had to return just because of such terrible lag throughout.

To be fair: I may have unknowingly download an app with a malware or something to make such a powerful phone so slow. Sad, but HAPPY BACK ON HONOR 6X"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"Just be ware that being a Chinese brand, do not support the 4g network in China! How shame on it! Never support Huawei again"
B0791VS3N9,W. Barnett,5,"I own a software company and am hard to impress--but this phone impresses me.

I really can't list one flaw with this phone. It makes great calls, both on ATT and when I connect wireless at home. It does Internet toggling beautifully well. It downloads your contacts and calendar from Google.It's very fast. The bluetooth connects easily and, for some reason, the FLAC music I have on the phone sounds much better than it did on my old S6. I use a high-speed 128 GB Samsung SDXC card and it works great (no lag-time like I've read about on other phones).It has an FM radio chip. (Not an app, but an actual FM radio chip.) And the camera is amazing.

How can they sell all of this for $250 ,,, who knows, but it's a bargain you'll love."
B0791VS3N9,Rodolfo Escobar,2,"El producto se entrego incompleto, ya que no traia los audifonos (manos libres)"
B0791VS3N9,Richard Muniz,5,"This is it, this is the phone you want to buy if your budget is less than $500. At half of that cost too. I always bought flagships, from Samsungs to HTC to Apple. I am switching to this phone from an iPhone X mainly because I wanted to sell it off before the next batch of iPhones were released, and also just because I missed Android. This phone is not a flagship and while you must keep in mind that this costs 4x less than most flagships, it does so well and I have little experience with budget phones that I can't help but compare it to them. I'm a week in and am so blown away by this phone that I figured it deserved a review. I do a lot of navigation for work, play Pokemon Go, and just normal social media from my phone.
Battery life - While it is not a two day battery life like some people claim, it is better than anything else I have used besides the Samsung Note devices. Normally I plug in when using Google Maps but decided against it just to test. After a full day at 50% brightness, waking up early and going to bed around 11, I was left with 10%. I had done around 3 hours of screen on navigation, around two hours of Pokemon Go, and around two hours of social media throughout the day. Very impressed. Should be noted that when I used the dual sim feature, the battery seemed to die a lot quicker and I was needing to charge by around 7.
Software - Running Huaweis own UI was the biggest concern of mine. I had almost went with a Nokia 6.1 because of the stock Android. It performed better than I could've imagined and I experience no slowdown at all, everything feels very snappy and I've only seen a couple lags on apps that seem to lag no matter the phone. Upgrade-able to Android 8.0 out of the box, time will tell if we get any more updates.
Design - Definitely nice feeling in the hand, I used the included case out of the box. Looks to be inspired my iPhone and while it is a good looking phone, I don't appreciate the branding on both the front and back. Although it is helpful as I had to check about 7 times to remember how to spell Huawei.
Display - A much nicer display then I thought would be possible on a device of this cost. Besides the blacks, I really can't tell a difference in this display and any from Apple or Samsung, definitely can't tell which is sharper but that may just be me. It does not get as bright as other phones, but I never use full brightness anyway.
Connectivity - Amazingly this was faster than both my iPhone X and my Galaxy S7. I am on the T-Mobile network and get around 50 mbps speed compared to the 37 on S7 and abysmal 13-20 on iPhone. GPS never has problems finding where I am and it reconnects very quickly. I don't use enough bluetooth to make a fair opinion but I will point out that some other reviews are correct. While on WiFi if you connect to a bluetooth device, my connection dropped by about 15 mbps. Not a big deal when it's 55 down to 40 in my case because it's still plenty fast but beware if you have a slower connection and use both a lot. I only use bluetooth in the car so it doesn't affect me. Oh this is a phone right? Call quality is decent. Nothing mind blowingly clear or really any difference from other decent phones. It also does not support 5ghz WiFi which is disappointing but not a deal breaker.
Camera - The part where most budget phones cut their corners. The camera is good. Better than most budget phones but not even close to any flagships. Low light isn't very good and it takes awhile to focus sometimes. Usually it gets the job done but this is probably the weakest point in the phone. Pictures can still look great provided you have proper lighting though. Front camera also gets the job done but a little washed out. I don't take selfies so again, not a deal breaker.
Value - Just buy it. I guarantee this phone will make you question why there are $1000+ smartphones. If you need a nicer camera on a phone I doubt you will find it on anything less than $600 though. It's a $230 phone that does 95% of everything phones 2,3,4x its cost will do. Plus you get a headphone jack, micro sd card or dual sim, there's also a case in the box. No headphones though. Extremely happy with this purchase and will update if anything changes."
B0791VS3N9,Suman Kumar,1,GPS doesn't work on this phone most of the time. It fails to find current location and hence Waze or Google maps doesn't work. This seems to be a known issue. My wife and myself are using this phone for more than 6 months. We are facing serious GPS issue on this phone from the very first day. Both Kids have iPhone and we have to use their phone for navigation. We are planning to upgrade both Kids phone but we are not considering to buy this phone due to serious GPS issue. Do you have any solution to fix this known GPS issue? Can you provide help/support number who can help us? I would happily buy two more Huawei Mate SE phones if GPS can be fixed.
B0791VS3N9,dmyrie,5,"UPDATE 07-23-18: So it's taken a little bit, but I ran across a setting on the phone that I've not seen on other Android devices that could help a lot of folks out there especially when it comes to battery management. If you've done any sort of deep dive into this or other Huawei phones, you've undoubtedly come across their great battery life but also the fact that some apps don't behave as well or give out weird notifications. Let's keep this simple: Android operating systems let apps run after you open them until you make them stop running (by selecting all previously open apps and clearing them). EMUI skips all that nonsense by pretty much shutting everything down once you finish with it (or sometime soon thereafter). Great for battery, but bad for things like say something that relies on geofencing (yes Arlo, I'm talking about you). But there is a very simple workaround.

To get an app working and to have it continue to work (like the caller ID app HiYa) here's what you do. Go to Settings and then to Apps and Notifications. Select Apps. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE APP PAGE you'll see ANOTHER Settings icon. Click on it. Now select Special Access and then Exempt from Battery Optimization. Your final step: click were it says Allowed and select All Apps. Once that is done, find the app you want to exclude from battery optimization, select it, and then select Allow (may drain your battery more quickly).

Selecting a few of these shouldn't have an adverse affect on you battery, just don't go crazy and select everything. Good ones to have selected besides HiYa: Visual Voicemail, Dropbox, and Wear OS. Hope this helps!

UPDATE 05-18-18: About a week ago I started to get this error when checking on one of my apps: Google Play Services Are Updating. From what I've read, the problem seems to be confined to Huawei and Honor handsets (and one has to wonder if it's because of the recent update to EMUI 8.0 and Oreo 8.0). The fix is easy - navigate to Settings and then to Apps & Notifications, Apps again and then find Google Play Services. Once you tap on the app, go to Storage and then hit ""Clear Cache"". Once that is done, finish it off by going to ""Manage Space"" and then ""Clear All Data."" If you were getting the Google Play Services Are Updating error, it should be cleared. My error was coming through the Arlo app- others reported they were having problems with Google Maps and Uber (or any app that relies on Google Maps for location).

UPDATE 05-17-18: Phone recently received Oreo 8.0 and EMUI 8.0 update about a week ago. Phone seems a little faster and still pretty bulletproof. I mentioned Arlo app problems- turned out Arlo was having a little Android/server meltdown a few weeks back (that has straightened itself out). One tip: make sure under geo-fencing you have your home address typed into the address box (the app decided my phone wanted to be in Madagascar - if only...). Wireless adapter still works but will still do the annoying reset ping over and over randomly. Full screen problem seems to have disappeared with the update (or maybe I just finally set all of the apps to fs every time they asked). Still liking the phone and recommending it to anyone in the market for a new handset.

ORIGINAL POSTING: :If youâre in the market for a new Android smartphone you have a multitude of choices. I recently started having problems with my Galaxy Note Edge (a one-time Samsung flagship) but given that the phone lasted way past its two-year mark, Iâd say I got my moneyâs worth.

The biggest factor in my decision making for getting the Huawei Mate Special Edition (SE) was price. Itâs hard to swallow paying upwards of $800 to $1,000 for a smartphone thatâs one drop away from becoming the worst thing to happen to you all week/month/year. On the other hand, after experimenting with lower-end budget phones (ZTE Maven and Moto G4), I learned that at least with Android, you do get what you pay for.

Iâm going to start with something a little different from most other reviews: apps I had to replace. Specifically, there were three stock apps that were tripping me up on the Huawei, because they wouldnât do certain things. I found free replacements for them on the Play Store and Iâve had no problems since the switchovers.

â¢ First the browser: Chrome on the Mate SE is slow and full of ads. I ditched it for (of all things) Samsungâs Internet browser coupled with two extensions for ad blocking (Adblock Fast and Disconnect for Samsung Internet). Much faster and you have the advantage of a home screen of web shortcuts you can create inside the app.

â¢ Next, the music player. For some odd reason, Huaweiâs music player doesnât read pre-made m3u files (these are files for playlists). You can make one on the phone, but if you have ones that were made on a computer, the phone wonât recognize them. Solve it by installing another music player (I used Pi Music Player and it works just fine).

â¢ As for the camera, the dual back facing cameras are pretty capable right out of the box (you will want to play with the photo and video settings to get high quality pictures). But there is one software/app problem that doesnât affect everyone but will affect some: in video mode, the camera wonât recognize an external microphone. Most smartphones can handle a TRRS microphone (4 âpolesâ and three black rings) ; the stock camera app on this phone can't. Solution: download a different camera app. I used Open Camera; to get it to work, in video settings, set the microphone to use external mic when present and you should be good to go.

Now the good stuff.

Is the Huawei Mate SE a good substitute for a Galaxy Note Edge? Yes. Is it as perfect as the Note Edge was in its hey-day? Nope. Am I much happier with a new Huawei than a three-year old Samsung? Definitely.

So letâs start with whatâs missing.

Thereâs no NFC, no 5G wi-fi, no removable battery and of course, no S-Pen. The Mate SE also has a bottom firing speaker that while loud, is kind of weird the first few times you listen to it. Screen resolution on the Mate SE is not as bright and crisp as the Note Edgeâs Super AMOLED display (but after a few days youâll get used to it).

What will you NOT get with the Mate SE that youâll get on other smartphones (some priced the same, some more expensive)?

â¢ No USB-C- Not a deal breaker for me b/c I have a ton of Micro USB chargers and cables lying around (so itâs actually a plus right now).

â¢ No Android 8.0 Oreo- The Mate SE ships with Android 7.0 (Nougat) but since the Mate SEâs sister phone the Honor 7x is now going through beta testing with 8.0, Oreo is probably in the Mateâs very near future.

So what is there to like?

â¢ Battery life. I run the same exact apps (plus the three substitutes I mentioned) on my Huawei as I did on the Galaxy Note Edge. At the end of the day, the Edge was at about 15% but the Mate SE is at about 50%. The Mate SE has a 3340mAh battery; the Note Edge a 3000mAh battery. Size-wise, itâs not a big difference, but the phone, the processor, and the 7.0 OS versus the 6.0 OS on the Note is obviously much more efficient. Advantage Huawei.

â¢ The fingerprint sensor. THIS THING WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. Iâve used a fingerprint sensor before, but I found it finicky and slow. Not so here: the Mate SEâs sensor is super, super, SUPER fast. Touch it, and youâre in.

â¢ Landscape mode: This is odd- on my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge I could never get the phone to do a decent landscape mode on the home pages. Inside an app, no problem, but on the home screens, it never worked. This phone does landscape on all pages. Itâs a little thing, but after missing it for so long, itâs kind of cool.

Cool Stuff Iâve not seen before since my last new smartphone three years ago:

â¢ IP67 dust or water resistance (originally I didn't think it had it, but apparently it's on the spec sheet).

â¢ Screenshot scroll. Youâve probably done a screenshot before, but what happens when you want to get an entire page as a screenshot that is longer than what you can see on the screen? Screenshot scroll takes care of that: itâs built-in software that will copy an entire page not just what is displayed on the phone (find it in drop down navigation menu). A regular screenshot is just a tap on the navigation button as well (instead of remembering a combo of volume up and power keys).

â¢ Speaking of the drop down navigation menu, Huawei gives you the ability to add a fourth button for that navigation menu at the bottom of your display. You can program the fingerprint sensor to perform a task by sliding your finger across the sensor (like say opening the camera), blocked numbers can be based on keywords and contacts, and Huawei has a virus scanner baked into the phone under the phone manager app.

â¢ Other goodies: you can encrypt photos and videos as well as lock certain apps so that you (and your fingerprint and nobody else) can use the app. Finally, thereâs App Twin- the ability to log into the same app using two different accounts at the same time. two different logins on the same app at the same time.

My last comments: troubleshooting some apps and things.

â¢ If you happen to use Waze with Android Auto, youâre going to have problems with the Mate SE the first time you try it. The fix: go to settings, go to apps, select Android Auto, delete all data including the cache, start Android Auto BEFORE you connect it to the car and go through the permissions. Once done, connect it to the car and you should be good to go. Donât ask, all I know is it worked for me.

â¢ I still havenât properly figured out why the phone and Wear OS (for smartwatches) isnât perfect (I had to reboot and start over several times to get watch faces to download.

â¢ If you miss wireless Qi charging from your old phone (or you want to add it to this one), buy a wireless adapter. I modified my old Note Edge to do wireless charging using an internal wirless pad; I did the same with the Mate SE using one that plugs into the bottom of the phone (search for a ""narrow side up"" Nillkin Magic Tag Qi Wireless Charger). It's about 12 bucks- worth the investment. The only drawback with mine: the Huawei Mate SE ""cycles"" through a bunch of charges. What I mean by cycle is it will charge, the screen will light up, and the phone will beep. That's normal when you start to charge, but it kept doing this over and over again about every 30 seconds or up to 2 minutes or so between cycles. Strangely sometimes it does it, sometimes it doesn't. I finally just loaded an old schedule setter app that turns the ringtone to zero each night and back to 100 in the AM in place of Do Not Disturb.

Iâll finish with this: the dumbest thing about this phone (and the nicest!) is the 18x9 display. On most apps it works perfectly fine. On some, a dialogue box pops up asking if you want to go âfull screen.â My answer is always yes and when I hit it, it makes you sometimes start all over again. Huawei- please fix this! Itâs the one annoying aspect of your phone that there doesnât seem to be a quick fix for.

Conclusion: if you need a new phone, buy this one. It comes with lots of memory (64GB built in) and lots of operating RAM (4GB). You can pop in a big SD Card (I have a 128GB) or another SIM if you want to go dual-SIM. Is it going to be as good as a flagship phone? No. But are you getting $600-$700 more âumphâ in a Note 8, S9, iPhone 8 or iPhone X than you would in a Mate SE? Thatâs for you to decide.

B0791VS3N9,Henry N,3,"The UI is very intuitive and it has great features. After three months, the screen broke from sitting with it in my back pocket (120 lb person screen facing toward the body)"
B0791VS3N9,Josu,1,"I was very happy the first couple of days, setting up and transferring everything from my Iphone 6 was easy and worked just fine.

Then I noticed that the speakers are not that great and it is a bit hard to listen to the phone calls on speaker mode. I thought, oh well.

Then I tried to install visual voicemail and there was no way, not happening. And I thought, OK, I can check the old way.

Then it disconnected from my WiFi and there is no way to reconnect it.

Then I noticed that sometimes you touch somewhere on the screen and it thinks you touched just below where you did.

The phone looked promising but it just sucks. I'm returning and getting an Iphone. I'm done exploring other options; what a pain this phone has been in less than a week."
B0791VS3N9,R. Yospe,1,"Pros: nice display, mostly unobtrusive modifications to stock Android
Cons: not great battery (very fast discharge), extremely bad WiFi and mobile data antennae.

Seriously, several other phones, ranging from a five year old Nexus to a LeEco Pro, and even another Huawei (Honor 8x) getting strong data signals, and this worthless Brock is struggling to get 120 bits/sec...

Yes, I said bits."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I purchased this phone due to the price . it replaced a great Samsung phone , that the dawgs knocked out of my hand and cracked the screen. The new Samsung phones are way too much money , and to repair a phone is expensive so i got this phone . i used ATT with a SIM card out of my old phone . when i got this phone i read the instructions on how to put the SIM card in . they provide a wire pin to push into a hole on the side of the phone and a tray pops out , then you place the SIM card and memory card on this plastic tray and side it back into the phone . the tray appears to be very fragile , and the instructions were not clear on exactly how to put both cards onto the tray . it is kind of scary because then you have to side the tray in and if it gets stuck you cannot get it back out . the procedure is easy when you know how , i don't want to over dramatize it . but you do need to be careful .it took me about 5 mins to totally figure it out

i took the SIM card out of my ATT Samsung phone put it on the tray slide it into the phone , turned on the phone , and it worked perfectly . then i used the pin provided , got the tray out and got my memory card from my old phone and put it into the tray , The tray has slots in it that has guides that shows you the orientation to use . the phone read the card , and i had all my old photos MP3's documents etc working just perfectly when i put it in .

Thus to move the cards is very painless , you just need to learn a different way from Samsung to do it .

this phone has a stand alone FM radio in it , that uses the ear phones as its antenna . This is something that should have been with the first smart phones . the radio will play through the head phones or through the speakers . thus with Samsung when I wanted to listen to the radio i had to use WiFi or my data plan to listen to the radio . the FM radio is a good one too .

The internet speed seemed to have a problem , but this seems for some reason to normalize .. what i mean that the speed test would not be as fast when tested it against my other computers or smart phones . after a week this has seemed to have worked it self out , and now it will register as the same speed as my other computers . so just be aware of this

another issue it that when i would send e mail , with a photo attached it would take a long time to send . for some reason this has work itself out and sends at the same speed and my other electronic . kind of weird , just be aware of it .
other wise i could not be more please with this phone . it works as it is suppose to . and as a computer it is perfect . i can talk on the phone , minimize the phone icon and use the completer to look stuff up , use the calculator etc while i m talking on the phone . i was not able to do this with the Samsung . maybe you could , but i was never able to do it .

SO IF YOU WAnt A GREAT PHONE that is not expensive that work as a smart phone is suppose to , and does it very well , this is it . i am very happy with my purchase"
B0791VS3N9,Sam C Chu,4,"sound too low. very !

B0791VS3N9,Victor Chiluiza,4,"Super phone, but battery seems to last litte.... it's new and less that 10 hrs and already need to recharge."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"Not true from china.
Do not buy any more"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"This review is way overdue, however I wanted to give myself time to use the phone and get used to its features so I have good information regarding its good qualities and bad ones as well. Fist of oll i am coming from the flagship world of LG and OnePlus phones. I've had the OnePlus One, X, and OP2. Also from the LG Family i've had all of the G Series phones from the G2 all the way through the G6 as well as all V-series phones, V10 and V20, .except the V30. In actuality it was the Huawei Mate SE that Drew me away from the V30 Purchase that I was about to make.The Good/Excellent Qualities of this phone. Actually there is nothing good about this phone.... The things that you like about this phone, are GREAT!!!!
Battery Life: I will go through 1complete day of heavy use (heavy video 3hrs and audio 2hrs streaming) plus regular internet and app (instagram and email) use. no gaming, and still have 15 - 20% battery life by the time i'm going to bed. So Battery life for me is outstanding and it does come with a quick charge feature as long as you use a qualcomm or compatible quick charge device.
Screen Resolution_ Outstanding. Pictures are crisp and colorful and the the stock UI comes with enough options to adjust color and hue to your liking. Also direct sunlight viewing is outstanding with no visible loss in color or shading. Love it!
Processing Speed without a doubt is excellent. Just as fast as any Flagship phone i've ever used. I multi task quite a bit (also come s with a split screen mode which i use frequently to fact check or look up items that I watch on youtube or shopping) and this phone handles everything that I do and more.
WIFI and Bluetooth - comes with an outstanding wifi radio which gets excellent reception from wifi transmitters that you may have problems with on other devices. Also the Bluetooth radio is excellent as well. more of a typical experience but non problematic as most Bluetooth setups are.
Form Factor: its lightweight and thin. very similar to an iphone 7+ or maybe a samsung glaxy 8+
finger print reader: Outstanding. quicker than an LG phone by noticeable lengths. and very reliable.

the not so great or just good::
bluetooth connectivity. I was having difficulties connecting the bluetooth after 3 days of continuous use withouth shutting the phone off. Ive found that shutting the phone off every 2 days alleviates the problem. however now Ive set the phone sho shut off and turn back on at 545-550 in the morning and now i don't even have to touch the phone. my bluetooth now connects flawlessly evry time i enable it.
The camera is good. i can take good quality pics with this phone in normal to medium/low light levels. I take hundreds of photos weekly and i am not disappointed in its capabilities. i've had better but for what you get with this phone, it heavily outweighs the camera inabilities
Lack of USB C..... Okay, this was a big one for me. as all of my newer phones from OnePlus2 to my LG G6 and V20 have had USB type C. It was hard switching back to micro usb and i notice the micro chargers are more susceptible to the ends bending where USB type C are more rigid. But for 239 dollars, it was worth the trade off but to be honest its a livable condition considering the high quality of the phone and the price.

In closing this phone dwarfs the LG G6 and V20 in functionality (ie.UI, and performance) and comes with a dual sim Tray, one of which can be used for expandable memory up to 256GB. but with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of available memory, you probably won't need it.,

Thats it! Honestly, the phone is amazing overall and i Highly recommend buying the Mate SE over the 7X as the added memory and processing speed are worth the extra 30-40 dollars you'll spend.on the phone. As long as Huawei keeps making high quality phones in this price range, i don't ever think i'll buy another 500-1000 dollar phone every again!."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,3,Only one day so far used this. Disappointed as there was no pin or headphone in the package. Will provide final review after 20 days.
B0791VS3N9,wild animals,1,"I can't get to everything right now but I want to mention a few things until I can do a full-fledged (and edited-for-length) review. And maybe someone will read this and share how to fix Hangouts!

I think a lot of these reviews must be from before the Oreo update, or from people who mostly just use the phone to browse the internet and text people (with the terrible built-in app).

I am going to get rid of this phone as soon as I can. I am frustrated every time I interact with it.

The battery life is CRAZY good... because the phone kills EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME. The battery lasts forever because the phone doesn't function. Rotten trade-off. There are several different settings (each in a different section) that you have to change for each app that you don't want killed, and then it doesn't work most of the time anyway. Yesterday I watched an alarm be dismissed by the phone before it could notify me. A little bubble popped up saying ""the app was blocked from using dropzone"" (even though the app has permission to use dropzone). What is dropzone? They ain't gonna tell ya. You can spend several hours a day googling crap that the phone is screwing up. (No solutions for most of them.) BTW, you have to grant permission for each app to use dropzone (and write over other apps) or it won't pop up and alert you. If you grant permission it still won't alert you, but there we are.

You will probably have a hard time finding the various relevant settings because Huawei moves them with every update, doesn't explain them to users or devs, doesn't explain what icons on the screen mean, etc. So when you start googling during your daily Huawei troubleshooting session, you will find hundreds of outdated user guides that describe the previous operating systems. When you install an app that needs to be whitelisted, the app will likely launch a whitelist tutorial that sends you to a settings menu that doesn't function anymore (protected apps). Otherwise they'll send you to an obsolete page that tells you how to whitelist apps in the previous version of the OS. Most pages don't list all of the relevant settings anyway so you have to piece them together. It seems that I'm missing something too because my notifications aren't working properly even though I've gone through the 20-step process on each app. Why isn't there a single button for this?

If you want to try to whitelist an app to run in the background at all times, you have to:
* Go to ""exempt from battery optimization"" and make sure the app is exempt.
* Go to ""launch"" then ""manually manage"" the app, and make sure all 3 options are checked
* Open the app you want to whitelist, press the square multi-window navigation button to show recent apps, then click the lock image in the header of the app preview. It should be set to ""locked."" This is supposed to keep the app from being closed when you turn the screen off (who knows?)
* Go to the notification settings screen for your app. On every single notification category, set it to priority. This may take some time
* Go to the dropzone settings and grant permission to your app
* Per Oreo, all apps must have a notification showing that the app is running in the background, so if the app has a persistent notification option, you probably (?) have to activate it to keep the app alive. (I have 9+ persistent apps in my notification browser at all times now, looks great, A+, love visual clutter)
* If you use the power saving setting (which btw isn't available in the quick settings for some reason) you'll have to add apps to the unrestricted data access list as well, which causes problems but is mandatory in some cases
* Reboot your phone or it won't work
* Enjoy your significantly reduced battery life

I did all of this, in stages, for Hangouts, because I have a Google Voice phone number and can only use Voice or Hangouts to text with that number. No matter what I try, I can't get it to notify me of texts unless I manually open the app. I unwittingly ghosted several people for several days because of this garbage phone and garbage Oreo/emui. I think part of the problem is that Google is intentionally making Hangouts trash to drive users to their other products. And Oreo is bad. But the other part is that Huawei sucks at software and has prioritized battery life over basic phone functionality. I still have a few things to try but honestly I've spent most of my free time the past week trying to fix this piece of junk and I'm over it.

Oreo really did a number on notifications, and it looks like Huawei made it worse. Notification banners are constantly popping up when I'm typing, and whenever a banner pops up, the keyboard disappears, I accidentally tap the screen in a spot that makes something bad happen, and (from what I know about it) Huawei immediately dismisses the notification so I can't revoke the app's notification privileges because I don't know which app it was. This may be Huawei or common to all Oreo phones, but either way it makes the phone unpleasant to use.

The speaker-phone volume is almost as quiet as the regular headset volume. Sometimes I have to hold the speaker up to my ear to hear YouTube videos at full volume. I have very sensitive hearing so it's not just me. The Bluetooth volume control (?) is so whacked that even when the phone is connected to an extremely loud speaker, the volume is not significantly higher than that of the phone's speaker. It is a software issue. Some apps have adequate volume and some don't.

Their native apps suck. They made a cool shortcut feature on the lock screen that canopen several apps like calculator and clock without unlocking the phone, but the apps don't work for my purposes and don't have enough settings to be made useful. The timer makes a ticking sound that you can't turn off in settings (really representative of Huawei's design style) and has limited sound choices which are bad and not appropriate for my work setting. The alarm clock is stupid. The calculator has no history or any settings at all really. That lock screen shortcut feature was part of why I bought the phone. They could have made it customizable but that's really not how they operate. I like the flashlight a lot but I had a lock screen flashlight on my Lollipop phone five years ago.

Seriously the worst phone I've ever owned.

Original review:
Huawei uses a customized version of Android just like most phone manufacturers do. It's sort of a wreck. I use Amdroid alarm clock religiously because it has special features to make sure I can't ignore alarms. I spent a lot of time changing several battery settings so that the phone wouldn't kill the app, and it worked when I tested it, but this morning it didn't go off anyway. I'm so glad I had a backup alarm set. There's a Don't Kill My App page that shows you how to keep Huawei devices from killing your alarms, and they said that Huawei is a real PITA because they don't share information about how the OS works, so this kind of thing is a continuing problem. Without Amdroid alarm clock (and the other time/alarm/reminder apps that the phone kills) I have no use for this phone. Reminders and alarms are one of the main reasons I even have a smart phone.

It's so responsive and fast, and the battery lasts a really long time. The camera is sick. I'm really pleased with some of the features. But the app-killing is a dealbreaker. I think I can find a way around it but I've already spent a LOT of time working on making the phone work properly and it shouldn't be this freaking hard. (Even if you do sort out the battery settings for apps currently on your phone, you have to set them per app, which is an ordeal, and you have to set multiple settings perfectly each time you download a new app or it won't work. It might not work anyway. It is a painful process.)

Also, it's taller than a Note 4 but skinnier, so even though I have ridiculously long fingers, it's uncomfortable to reach search bars and things like that. (And the back/home/search bar is obnoxious.) It's a two-handed phone. YouTube videos look tiny because they're limited by the width of the screen. It's a tiny video on top, then the screen below is mostly filled with comments. If you tap ""fill screen"" then there are huge black bars on the sides. You have to hit ""zoom"" to fill the screen which crops out parts of the video (I haven't seen it on this phone yet but cropping like that usually cuts off captions). Most apps aren't optimized to work with this stupid aspect ratio so the OS displays an alert on the bottom (""tap to expand to fill screen, this may cause errors"" or whatever) that fills up part of the screen. Basically the additional length isn't useful, and apps don't fill it, but makes the phone uncomfortable to hold. If you have a 5.93"" phone that is shorter and wider, videos, images, etc., will be way bigger and the phone will probably be easier to navigate.

The speaker is on the bottom right, so if you hold it by the bottom edge in your right hand, the speaker will be covered.

It's a budget phone but I don't think it's cheaper to make a phone skinny with the speaker in a bad position, and set it up to kill apps constantly. Those were design choices. I'm pretty bummed.

I ordered my phone as an Amazon warehouse deal and I regret it. It arrived in a box that had been retaped twice. So I'm concluding that someone bought it and realized the right edge of the screen isn't touch-responsive, then they sent it back. It was ""inspected"" and taped back up. Someone else bought it and sent it back, it was inspected and taped again. I bought it and am sending it back. Don't be the fourth person, lol. It isn't that much cheaper and i have to set up a new phone all over again."
B0791VS3N9,J.H.,4,"This is my second Huawei phone in a year as I upgraded from an Honor 6x purchased this time last year. That phone was still going strong but I wanted more RAM, storage and solid unibody design. I was so impressed with the 6x after some consideration I decided Huawei ticked all the right boxes once more.

That said this is much the same phone as the 6x but with a different form factor, somewhat stronger processor, and more RAM. Improvements include build quality, more vivid display with higher contrast ratio, smoother HD video streaming, and better audio through the headphone jack. It also has face unlock. However you need to wake the phone to it's lock screen to use the feature. The finger print sensor is faster to unlock the phone, but it's still a neat feature.

Phone has no quick charging capabilities or NFC. It also appears a bit drab in grey as the grey used is...drab. If you want the phone to appear expensive and upscale choose the white and gold varient. Oh, and the camera is good in this segment with lots of features.

For what it is and priced at $200 to $250 it's one of the best choices in smartphones one can make. Sleek, solid, reliable, and modern. I am good to go with Huawei for another year. This a great basic use phone."
B0791VS3N9,Eli Segal,3,Does not go good for services.
B0791VS3N9,evas151,4,"Very good value smartphone considering it's relatively low price point. My only complaints are that the camera quality is not as nice as my old MotoX, the external speakers leave a lot to be desired (volume is very low even when set on max, especially if you have a phone case), and the fingerprint sensor is a bit finicky sometimes. The phone also comes with a lot of bloatware apps, which I disabled upon setting up. The battery life is amazing compared to my old MotoX though. I can use it all day browsing the internet and it will still have plenty of power at the end of the day. I also snowboard in the winter and even in single digits temperatures the phone stays on and holds its charge. Just make sure you check with your phone carrier if this phone is compatible first. This model works perfectly on the AT&T network. However it is not fully compatible with T-Mobile - as per their tech Dept, the Mate SE is 100% compatible on the data network, but only 50% compatible on the calls/texts, so that is something you will want to keep in mind."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,2,Second sim card will not work with at&t! Will only work with a 2g network
B0791VS3N9,John W. Ashby Jr.,5,"Great mid range smartphone with 64 gb of internal memory and 4 GB of RAM. The phone is well built, and has a solid feel to it. The camera, while not on par with the highest end Apple or Samsung Galaxy phones, is great in good light situations. I normally use the phone heavily, with streaming satellite radio at work while surfing the web and maybe playing a game. The ram in this thing means that everything runs smoothly. I have not had one problem with this phone. In fact, I bought a second one for my wife and she loves hers also. Two of these phones cost less than one of the even last generation Iphones or galaxies. Octa core processor, 64 GB of memory, 4 GB of ram, all at a great price."
B0791VS3N9,Michael D. Wright,5,"I am using this on the metro pcs network. I am upgrading from the ZTE Zmax Pro and have to say this phone is a massive upgrade. There is nothing you can complain about here:

+Bright crisp display. 24bit, 1080p,5.93in,ips,18:9,gorilla glass. Awesome colors with deep inky blacks.
+Fast Processor: 2.3ghz octa-core processor
+Memory: Whopping 4gb Ram+64gb onboard storage! Micro sd expandable up to 256gb
+Camera: 8MP front camera combined with a dual 16MP rear. Takes quick very clean photos
+Software: Updated to Android Oreo. Stock phone has minimal bloatware. Useful preinstalled apps
+Unlocked: GSM network
Bottom line if this phone had Apple or Samsung pained on the front the price would be $499 minimum. I can't say enough how much value this phone offers. Fantastic phone!"
B0791VS3N9,JOEY,3,Order arrived when promised and it's actually a really good phone. BUT just incase it is important (it is for me especially since Cricket only allows 8mbps download cap) That would be okay but that is only with LTE PHONES! This is a 4g phone and therefore it is only capable of spitting out 4 mbps downloads. It really sucks cuz other then that love this phone.
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"I've had the phone for approximately 6 months and I love it aside from the picture quality in low light. My big concern is that the US government has big issues with Huawei and it's alleged spying issues. There may be a time in the future where it will be difficult to get technical support or repair work done if Huawei offices are not in the USA.
You may wish to consider purchasing a different brand of phone. Which is a shame because the phone is really good."
B0791VS3N9,Sadiq Muradov,1,"Phone looks good. Its screen, view all are ok but if it is not sent from China. There are not any google services including play store too. So it suddenly looses its functionality. Chinese all over the place through the phone menus settings etc. Also there were problems related to screen sensors, i.e. the phone wasn't working properly as expected. I dont know how people place 5 to this seller, but it doesn't seem as an honest seller to me."
B0791VS3N9,HeyYo346,5,"So I've owned iPhones and Galaxy's, and after paying a third of the price for this phone I truly believe Huawei is the best of both worlds! The camera is better than the iPhone, it has portrait if you're into that, also the Kirin processer is extremely smooth, almost ""Apple smooth"". This is the best Android I've owned, and I will never buy a Galaxy again. If you love the iPhone but want to try Android, you will absolutely love this device. The battery last forever and it's basically an iPhone trapped in an Android body. So before you buy a 800$ phone, consider this phone. Also if you are worried about Huawei spying, I'm just gonna put this out there, I have personally had 2 iPhone 7 phones hacked remotely And a Galaxy 7 hacked so...I don't trust any manufacturer anymore. And almost all phones are made in China, so if any of the other manufacturs wanted to spy they could, if they aren't already."
B0791VS3N9,ryan mcmahan,5,I have had this phone for a few weeks. I am extremely impressed. I got tired of having a samsung with at&t where they would release updates to slow it down. This phone does not have that and its well priced. I am very impressed. The battery life is amazing i used it all day 13+ hours and im still at 80% My usage includes social media connections to stock widgets and tickers. multiple long phone calls. connections to my home security system. The phone is fast and runs well. Only cons i have are that there are no available methods to root it or unlock the bootloader and how there isnt 5g on wifi. Other than that fantastic phone!
B0791VS3N9,Gregory Chu,2,"Got this phone in early 2018 because I had issues after only a year and a half with my Nexus 5X and didn't want to throw several hundred dollars at a phone. Excited based on the reviews to try this one. First few months were great. Somewhere around July 2018 a software update totally ruined this phone. The GPS accuracy went to crap and my navigation apps were basically unusable (Google Maps and Waze). It's now December and not fixed. Also, my Fitbit Alta HR can't sync with this phone anymore; it's not on Fitbit's compatible equipment list but it did work when I first got the phone."
B0791VS3N9,Petals,1,"Warning: President Trump has banned the purchase of this brand of Chinese phone by the military due to the fact that it was determined that China steals the data that is on the phone. So, if you do online banking via this phone, Chinese data collectors will have your password, etc., to drain your bank account. Secondarily, anything made in China is intentionally made not to last much less to any standards of quality. Avoid at all costs. Personally, any electronic device that contains personal identifiers and passwords that is made in China should not be purchased for safety's sake."
B0791VS3N9,aaaaaaaa,5,"First I need 3.5 mm phone jack, finger-print, and 6 inches screen. Purchased the honor 7x AL10/TL10 version before but not support the T-Mobile LTE; Mate 10 pro doesn't have gold color; the L24 version of honor 7x has only 32GB/3GB; this phone (L34 version) has same spec as honor 7x with T-Mobile LTE bands and 4GB RAM. Only complaint is that 64GB is still not enough; would like to pay more for 128GB.

More thoughts: the second SIM card has 2G (phone call & message) only; if you have AT&T SIM (2G shutdown), got to set it to main SIM, otherwise no service; all calls and messages have a label of SIM 1 or 2; the clone function makes it very easy to transfer app and data from other phone within same WiFi network by scanning the QR code."
B0791VS3N9,AwallsRN,2,the camera was a joke! ive had lower megapixels that worked better... the dual camera was not really dual... if you covered one of them it did nothing just one of them was working. deff a deal breaker for a nearly $300 phone returned if the day I received it! maybe it was just defective but ill not try again on this brand.
B0791VS3N9,SealBeachcomber,1,"I purchased this in June, 2018 with some hesitation because of security concerns. When new concerns began appearing in the media in mid-July, I returned the phone while it was still within the 30 return period. To the best of my understanding, the new concerns are that the manufacturing process used by Huawei leaves the phones vulnerable. Search terms Huawei security July 2018 to learn more about the new concerns."
B0791VS3N9,Maria G.,4,"I've had this phone for a few days now. Pros are as everyone else has mentioned. Typing is so fluid and switching between apps and overall processing speed of the phone is incomparable. I replaced a Galaxy Note 5 with this phone, so the improved battery life and increased fluidity is definitely recognizable.

Some issues I have are minor, but I think they're important to know because they are things I will be looking for in a future phone, due to the absence in this one.

1. No quick charging, but I knew this when I bought the phone, just didn't realize how much I valued it due to my high daily usage. To be honest it's not necessary due to this phone's long battery life, but still a nice feature to offer.

2. Lack of tempered glass screen protectors. You will get frustrated trying to find one because for some reason this model isn't popular enough. A lot of cases though.

3. Notifications not expandable on lockscreen. Some may feel this is hit or miss, but I really miss being able to quickly reply or check a full notification on my home screen. I messaged Huawei, they said this won't be capable on this phone at all.

4. No wifi calling, again I already knew this when I bought the phone but would be nice to have.

5. No NFC reading capability. Doesn't affect me but important to know.

I wouldn't buy this again at 250 because of these little nuances, but it truly is a good mid range phone and does last all day which is very valuable. I'd recommend just waiting till it goes on sale to get it, unless you need a phone right away."
B0791VS3N9,amoinus,5,"About 3 years ago I switched from Android to iPhone, because I was so frustrated by the general low hardware quality of Android phones (including those expensive galaxy), the poor power management of the OS itself forcing me to charge more than once a day and develop a battery worry syndrome, I was happy for a couple of years.

Now 3 years into iPhone ownership, I am more and more pissed off by the control freaks in Apple, and the greediness of this company, so I started research Android phones again.

My past experience told me even as expensive as galaxy, they slow down to a crawl over a few weeks after I install a bunch of apps, so I am staying away from Samsung or any expensive option.

A friend recommended this phone, I was very suspicious how good can a 200 bucks phone can be, but this is cheap enough for me even if it became a toss away toy, but I was so happily surprised.

After a few weeks, I am fully moved off my iPhone 8+ to this device, and no way I will be shifting back. It is a huge loss to US consumer to not have this brand as easily available as most other brands, and I think I understand why after having one now. Apple will be completely dead in a matter of a year or two if US market opens up to Huawei. My recommendation is get yourself these devices before more nasty trade barrier is built, then you will have no option but get ripped by Apple or Samsung."
B0791VS3N9,Michael Boggs,5,"I purchased my Huawei mate se because I wanted something that had more memory
and ram. After ordering it it was delivered on time and there was nothing defective inside or outside of the shipping box. After setting the phone up it quickly updated to the most recent update Android 8. The phone is very quick has a picture quality that is just amazing. I tested it using Bluetooth, mirror share and wifi didn't have one problem with connection. I use at&t as does most my family and they received 3 bars of signal while my mate se is getting full 4G LTE signal
Awesome phone! I'll be purchasing another one for a back up without a doubt. For those of you that are wanting a really good phone get this one trust me at the price we're the ones benefitting."
B0791VS3N9,Paolo Francis,3,"It's a pretty buggy phone. Overall it's okay for the price but I wouldn't compare it to any flagship phones. I had HTC M8 before for a very long time and it served me well. In some ways it still beats this Huawei SE.

Things that stand out to me after a couple of months are: camera quality is lacking; vibrate mode is barely noticeable and I miss a lot of calls because I can't feel it buzzing; speakers are okay and it's not as loud as my old phone, sometimes it's hard to hear people even on max; no extra storage slot; bluetooth doesn't work with Apple products; Huawei suit is not available in Apple store so I don't even know how to transfer files at this point, useless; virtual keyboard could be better; tap to zoom works in a weird way, especially in games; some other things I can't think of right now.

It's an okay phone, like it's good but it's okay. It's a 3 star phone that is nothing special or mindblowing. It's buggy and while I am writing this review, the phone asked me to pair my Apple... when I turned off bluetooth on the phone and my Mac 5 minutes ago. It's the little things like that..."
B0791VS3N9,Jetally,5,"Been using this awesome phone now for a week. I will list the pro's and con's of the phone.
Pros:
64 GB of internal storage. That is a ton of space for apps you can put on the phone. Pictures and videos also if you don't have a microSD card. Love it.
MicroSD card slot. I put in my MicroSD card and for the first time a smart phone that didn't ask to reformat the card and lose all your pictures. That is pretty awesome.
Kirin 659 CPU is fast! Octa Core CPU running 4 cores at 2.36 GHZ and 4 Cores at 1.7 GHZ. Every app opens really fast.
4 GB of RAM. I have had up to 20+ apps open at the same time and still had 2 GB free of RAM. No slow down with many apps open with more RAM to spare to open up a bunch more apps.
Phone running Nougat 7 Android OS and I heard that Oreo 8 Android will be rolling out to the phone next month in May. That was a big selling point to me to get the latest Android. When I set up my phone it had a update for EMUI and also updated to the latest security updates released by Google Android.
Antivirus protection already on the phone out of the box. Avast security is running on the phone! Pretty good antivirus program and didn't have to pay for the antivirus program. Always a plus. I found this by looking through all the settings on the phone.
The one speaker sounds pretty good while on the speaker phone or listening to music. Wish it had 2 speakers.
I easily connected to my Bluetooth Headset and Bluetooth on my car stereo which sounds really good.
The Camera has alot of settings you can change and takes pretty good pictures.
For $229 this phone works great.
Cons:
The only con I find in this phone is wish the battery was bigger. At least a 4000 MAH battery. However I browse the web, check work and personal email, Facebook, google +, listen to Pandora internet radio all day, text, make phone calls, access other apps and still have some battery life at the end of the night before I go to bed. I have always felt that smartphone batteries could be better/bigger but this battery on this phone does its job."
B0791VS3N9,Ally J,2,"I always try to buy phones that can be rooted easily. I am a developer. When I purchase a new phone, the previous phone is used for development. Why not? It's my phone. I paid for it.

This company was ending their program that allowed consumers to unlock the bootloader of their phone. Although I requested the unlock code many times before the deadline, the company chose to string me along with instructions that didn't work and directed me to irrelevant or non-existentent links.

While the phone is a decent phone for the price, the fact that it will end up in a landfill somewhere greatly reduces its value and the misleading/poor customer service reduces it further.

I will not be purchasing another Huawei phone."
B0791VS3N9,"Scott from Lutz, FL",5,"I purchased this phone from Amazon. It's everything that the video reviewers and people say it is. I could find no fault in it. I ended up returning it though because for me coming from a Samsung Galaxy S4 I just found the phone to be to a bit too bit. It's more than 1/2 inch longer than the Galaxy S4 and it's also a bit wider. After just a few days, I found my hands a bit tired of holding the phone as it's also heavier and tired because of the slightly more reach in order to text with it quickly.

I want to emphasize this really is a great phone for the price. Best I have seen but keep in mind when you're purchasing a new phone than form factor is something you should also think about.

After having this phone, I have to say that Huawei makes a great product."
B0791VS3N9,4N6-PRO,5,"I rarely write product reviews, but in the case of this Huawei Mate SE, I felt compelled to tell other buyers like me that you will be pleased with this device provided you don't need to have NFC. Otherwise, I highly recommend this smartphone. I bought one at first to make sure that it measured up to reviews. After a short time and enjoying its performance, I bought another for my wife. She loves her's too."
B0791VS3N9,patagoniac57,5,"Why spend $1000 on a phone when this $230 phone does most of what you need? The display is edge to edge (left to right), the body is unibody aluminum, the fit and finish is great, the fingerprint reader is amazingly fast, and the performance is really fast. They also give you a free clear case that fits well. I have the Huawei noise canceling earbuds, but they don't charge via the phone headphone jack, like it does on older Huawei phones. I am not a power user of a phone, but I am impressed with the Huawei quality/performance for the price. Setup is easy, you run a Huawei cloning app on your old phone, and it transfers data and apps to the new phone vis Bluetooth. Compared to aluminum iPhone, the antenna lines on the back look much nicer, and the blend into the case much better."
B0791VS3N9,Steve,5,"I've had the phone for several months and so far it has been great. I'm using a Samsung Fast charger which I feel has made the charging faster compared to the standard charger. The phone is a little larger than what I'd like but the screen real estate is fantastic! The screen is durable but I would recommend a screen protector.

This phone isn't like the flagship phones in which some features you are used to may not work as well on this phone, although they are being updated often. One thing is if you have more than 1 bluetooth device connected it cannot figure out which one to use. This is being fixed with Android Oreo which is being pushed in the next month.

If you're looking for accessories, look for Honor 7x instead of the Huawei Mate SE. This will make things much easier and at times cheaper too. They are the same phone just rebranded for the US markets for some reason.

I've refereed this phone to others and I will not be buying a $800 phone again."
B0791VS3N9,OmegaDan,4,"I bought this phone to not only review on my channel since I'm a tech reviewer, but also because I needed a backup phone as my main Axon 7 phone is starting to display some iffy battery life. With that being said, this phone is quite the buy and for $250 dollars you are getting one of, if not the best budget smartphone of the year for now.

The Full HD plus screen is quite eye catching and visually pleasing and you can see this even more so with some nice wallpapers in the background. The colors look more cooler and arguably more naturally looking compared to the slight oversaturation of Quad HD AMOLED displays. I love the sleek and light form factor of the phone but the design doesn't give me much of a WOW factor as compared to some other Huawei phones I've seen. While I am slightly perplexed as to why this phone comes with a micro usb port, I appreciate that they still have the 3.5mm headphone jack.

The dual camera at the back shoots some nice pictures with good dynamic range, sharpness and clarity in good lighting conditions. Video recording at 1080p 30 frames is good but with no optical image stabilization, you will need a stabilizer or small tripod to get some stable footage. There are a respectable number of filters and camera modes such as slow motion, panorama, and one of my favorites, Light Painting. The front camera, which is 8 MP, unfortunately takes some slightly out of focus face shots and its beauty mode is more of a hit or miss and looks as though it is making my face more artificial. Even when you turn it off fully, I feel that the camera is still adding the beauty effect in some shape or form. AR Lens has some face animations but they are few and won't be replacing your Snapchat animations anytime soon.

The software is EMUI 5.1 with Android 7.0. I actually have no issues with the user interface and navigating it was fluid and seamless. I like the battery management systems and the pre-installed virus scanner which is powered by Avast. The fingerprint scanner is pretty fast and possibly one of the fastest on any phone in this price range. The performance is definitely good as playing games was pretty good. I did notice that more heavily graphic intensive games, such as Asphalt 8, may lag and drop frame rates a bit but that it not always the case. Switching between apps and using multi window is done fluently on this phone.

Two main red flags were found in my experience with the phone. There seems to be an overheating issue as the phone really heats up after a while of watching Youtube videos and playing games. The temperature rises to the point that I have to hold the phone a certain way so that my palms won't be affected as much. Secondly, the single speaker grill can easily be blocked when using the phone in landscape mode and the speaker lacks good bass and loudness, even on its highest volume.

Other than those two main gripes and the slight issue with the front camera, the phone is perhaps the best budget smartphone you can buy and is great for all daily tasks and even some light to moderate gaming. I am already considering to make this phone my daily driver but only time will tell."
B0791VS3N9,Gary Guddy,4,"The reason I give 4 stars is that nothing is ever perfect. However, I have few to no complaints with the phone I've had for over 2 years. The Huawei is a very good value for under $300. I'm thinking about upgrading with this offer simply because the value for the upgrade is reasonable. I'm usually very frugal and would avoid doing this, but the value is too tempting for the price. Verizon doesn't accept this phone. I've been with ATT. The phone and provider have provided reliable service in high desert, mountain regions, that are very rural."
B0791VS3N9,OSPINA01,5,"I deleted my original review because this phone doesn't deserve any negative reviews. I had reviewed on my opinion after a quick open startup and shut down....without actually really putting any kind of use to base my opinion on because although it says 5.9"" I was a little frustrated as it's actually smaller then my Note 4 and I bought this to replace my aging Samsung Note 4 and after I gave a mediocre review last night my Note gave out this morning just unresponsive. I had printed the return labels and I was sending this back.

Well to my surprise this phone turns out to be the best phone I have ever had, just amazing.
The display is so crisp, the audio is pretty solid, the CAMERA! The camera is out of this world, my wife who uses her S6 to take pictures of everything and anything just fell in love with it so we are buying another one for her. I uploaded a few pics of random things. It's running Android 7.0 flawless, I have TMobile and all I did was put my sim in and I have signal where I couldn't even get 2 cans and a string to work. As for the gov telling us to not buy this phone...... Yeah, I found no malware so far so I'm not worried.
Updating:
I want to add this in, screen is actually 5.7; I installed cpuz to get the true specs because although they advertise 5.9 something isn't feeling right so review the screen shot.

Here i am a yr later, the phone is still AMAZING me and i find new features each day it seems like. i recommend this phone. If your still on the fence which ""budget phone"" to get this is it. I havent had a screen protector on it and the screen is still solid and glossy still. I can say enough how much i still love this phone."
B0791VS3N9,m t,3,"This is a good phone, a great one at the price point. However, you should know that this phone does not support Wi-Fi 5GHz. In most cases, this will not be a problem since most routers have support for both 2.4 and 5. I had my router set up on the 5GHz channel and it took me a while to figure out why I could not connect. More importantly, if you're left-handed and you want--need--right to left layout support, this does not have it. Not sure if this is applicable to the entire Huawei product line. I would have given this a 4.5-5 star rating, but the lack of right to left layout support is bothersome to my left-handed wife and there are probably others who feel similarly."
B0791VS3N9,mike,5,"This phone was issued to me for work. And it's causing some interesting issues for me. Namely what in the heck am I spending all that money monthly for my S8? A curved screen (never doing that again)? Water resistance? QHD screen? Last year's flagship specs? A stupid heart rate monitor (has anyone actually used it more than once?)? I'm really stumped here. Sure it's not as fast, doesn't have quite as good or a screen or quite as good of a camera. All I know is, it's not a $500 difference.

I'd like it to have Qi charging and water resistance, but at this price it's excusable. It has micro USB (stop crying people), so what. I'm not the clown running around the office trying to find someone with a USB C or Lightening cable because I don't have a spare and forgot to bring mine. Open drawer and PICK ONE with spares to go around! Plus it really doesn't matter since the battery is really good for a phone twice this price. It has a headphone jack for those that care... Just pointing it out. Lack of GHz WiFi. Haven't noticed it being an issue. Lack of a few obscure random AT&T or T-Mobile bands... again haven't noticed any real world issues. The stock launcher is a bit ""different"" if you're coming from Samsung or some other Android skin. Give it a week and it's no big deal. If you're coming from an iPhone it'll be quicker."
B0791VS3N9,G,1,Excellent device. One star since does not get timely firmware updates.
B0791VS3N9,crystal,1,"I experienced the same malfunction on two of these phones. The phone goes into ""sleep"" mode after 30 seconds - and you can not change the setting once it is randomly initiated. Clearly, there is a software glitch, and I had the misfortune of having two devices affected. It doesn't happen at first but a week then 3 in both cases. I done with this phone. I need a device I can at least read through an email before shutting down."
B0791VS3N9,A.J. Wukawitz,3,For the money it's a pretty decent phone however I feel you can spend an extra 75 bucks and get an essential phone and have a flagship device with much better build quality and just a snappier device
B0791VS3N9,DI in SC,5,"Great phone! My Nexus 6 wasn't holding a charge. After my husband replaced the battery and did a factory reset, I was still charging it 3 times a day with moderate use. I was waiting for the Moto 6 plus only to learn it would not be released in the US. My tech savvy son recommended the Mate SE. I was surprised by the specs given the price and decided to give it a go. So glad I did! I'm in my 60s and found it very easy to transfer my old phone. G-mail didn't work at first but once all the Google updates were complete, it was perfect. The display is bright, audio clear and the font size is customizable. Pictures are clear and crisp. Most of all, I love that the phone is so light and easy to hold. I usually have 30 percent battery left at the end of the day. I've always had an Android phone and this tops every one of them. Everything about this phone is fast and smooth. Highly recommend!"
B0791VS3N9,Kristi,3,"This phone was great overall for the first month I had it. One thing that is a continual issue is the bluetooth, it cuts in and out while driving which is an issue being in a ""hands free"" city. I received an update notice over the weekend and applied it. Now I can no longer text photos (which the camera quality is pretty good) or receive any. This is a problem since that is a lot of my texting. I have sent in help emails and hope to have this glitch resolved ASAP."
B0791VS3N9,CEB,5,"Hi quality full feature device for the price. Long lasting battery, no lag, solid build. Resembles the iPh0ne. Camera quality is lacking for a new device this day but is acceptable for quick snaps. I don't like the odd 18:9 ratio. No option for 3x2 size photos. My old Note 4 is superior camera quality over this. Not a deal breaker though. Again, for 250 bucks for an unlocked dual SIM phone with these specs, it's a steal.

Bought mine from B&H after seeing it in person. A+"
B0791VS3N9,richard,5,This is a very good budget phone I was very impressed this was my first Huawei phone. This phone has definitely made me interested in a more expensive Huawei phone. The phone does not stick or give any problems the only negative is the picture quality is average. It's definitely a phone that can do a lot of tasks and I honestly did not miss my high-end phone except for the camera this phone also has excellent battery life. Do not hesitate to purchase.
B0791VS3N9,Nathaniel S.,1,"Huawei makes such competitive products, but they just don't last. Before this phone, I owned another of their phones. Unfortunately, the camera stopped working just after the warranty expired. With this phone, I've experienced issues with the camera as well. Both times I've called the company, only to be told that they could not do anything for me, since I was out of warranty. As much as their phones outperform many of their competitors, they do not last long enough to justify buying from them."
B0791VS3N9,Adam Cham,5,"Great phone, intuitive operating system, great battery, and vibrant colors. My only complaint is that the speakers aren't the best, but that is a very minor part of the experience. You would think that paying 4x the price of the Mate SE for an iphone x (or whatever absurdly priced phone that will be obsolete in a few months) would get you a phone that is 4x better, but this is far from the truth. Don't buy into the hype, you can get a great phone at a great price and avoid an unnecessary payment plan."
B0791VS3N9,James Hawkins,5,"I am not a reviewer, by any means. I'm merely writing this to underline how fantastic of a product this phone is. The price point vs the performance, quality, EXTREMELY user friendly interface, and the numerous other exceptional features are simply incredible. To be honest, I buy a phone, I keep it until it it's final breath. My last two Samsung's each literally ended their individual lifespans with a deathrattle. Each one lasting for an excruciatingly long time, by most of today's smartphone consumers' standards. Picture Doc Holiday at the end of Tombstone. I have no doubt this little guy will last just as long, and at a mere fraction of the price I've paid for inferior specs and performance. I'm thrilled. I love it, and I actually look forward to upgrading. If for no other reason than to see what the other models have in store."
B0791VS3N9,Kadidja,5,"Pros- amazing battery life for someone who is constantly on her phone (I charge it once a day or every two days), looks beautiful and I like the feel of the phone. Very good deal , even though I had my doubts. Because of this phone, never again will I go back to Samsung.
Cons- currently have none."
B0791VS3N9,Max19k,3,"This is a great phone for the price, with actual performance and features you would find in upper market phones. BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW two major flaws this device has before buying it:

1. You can only use it EITHER double sim OR one sim + micro sd card. Yes, it is double sim and yes, it supports external memory, but you can only use it in the way I mentioned before because apparently Huawei engineers couldn't be bothered to provide one slot for sim cards
tray and one slot for the memory card, so the phone uses the only two-slot tray it has to accomodate the three cards, which it can't so you have to decide between double sim with no memory or one sim with memory.

2. The camera SUCKS.

If you are used to great camera phones such as Xperia (my case), Pixel, Nokia, etc, you will be very dissapointed with this phone's camera performance. It is as bad as it gets.

The rest of the features and performance, however, are only second to much more expensive phones."
B0791VS3N9,Sabrina Taylor,4,"Great phone. I bought it for my daughter, now I want one for myself. The camera is great. The only drawback is that it's not compatible with the Straight Talk service. I read where it's compatible with Straight Talk, and that's why I bought it, but it's not. . .so now I'll have to switch providers. . . Or return it. That's the only reason it got 4 stars. . It's not compatible with Straight Talk."
B0791VS3N9,brisida,1,This phone was the worst ever. I lost everything because was not recognizing the password.
B0791VS3N9,Heather Johnson,5,So glad I took the risk and ordered an unlocked phone and did some research online on the overall reviews of this phone. So far I love it. The clarity is pristine and the functionality is great. It was super easy to just put my SIM card from my Cricket Wireless carrier into this phone and it worked without any difficulty at all whatsoever. This also arrived super quick. Highly recommend.
B0791VS3N9,Alan Tauber,4,"The phone is fantastic, greate screen, excelent memory and speed. The only problem was that I didn't received the earphone, according to Huawei it must include in the box. My order was sent to a PO Box in Miami that forwards the product to Paraguay. When I made the claim to Amazon, they told me that the products sent to intermediaries have noguarantee. I received the box perfectly closed, with the factory seals unvoided.
It is a warning for those who buy through PO boxes, because even if the product comes incorrect or factory failed , we have no guarantee."
B0791VS3N9,Adam,5,"This is an amazing phone. After being a long time iphone user and recently buying a galaxy note 9 i got this phone for my son. Im really surprised by the quality and similiarity to any other flagship phone for 219.00.

Im seriously considering a future purchase of a hauwei phone over apple,samsung or lg."
B0791VS3N9,Gil,1,Beware of this brand. After a year of use I began to get pulldown ads even though I use Adblock. What finally killed it for me was when clicking on Gmail they kept trying to switch to Huaeai Gmail which says they have they right to view my mail. Reluctantly I am going to abandon the brand.
B0791VS3N9,Carolyn,5,"I only care about the basic of things: Screen quality, picture quality, speed, and battery life. This phone meets all of those. I bought it at $240, but I see it went on sale right after I bought it. It has a good ppi, the camera on the back has been really good quality and the camera on the front is better than any camera on my past phones. It's fairly fast on it's own, but games are a breeze. I don't have it in power-saving mode and the battery lasts all day. The one con is it takes forever to charge, but I just plug it in before I go to sleep."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,"This phone is a viable option for those who've always been iPhone users but cannot afford the new phones. The only things I will say that are cons are that the phone's front camera isn't that great, scrolling through content is kind of choppy compared to the smooth new iPhones, and the charger isn't a USB C. Otherwise, I have absolutely no complaints. This phone is great for the money."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,5,I had a Samsung..it was terrible..I had an LG which would get extremely hot ...this Huawei mate se is the best phone I have ever had so far..before I bought it I reviewed it over and over again..then I purchased it and I am a pappy camper...the battery life amazing..only thing I wish it rang louder but thatâs ok considering this phone mimics the iPhone in some ways with out the price...when I save up I will get an upgrade ..but if this phone keeps working as it is I will stick by it...love this phone...
B0791VS3N9,Derek Smith,5,"This is one amazing phone! Even if it is just a budget tier phone it works amazingly well. Fast and fluid. Apps run very smooth. In the months I have had it, it has never reset or frozen up. I have this phone and also the honor 7x. I do like this mate se better with the extra power inside. Listen the bottom line is you can get a beautifullly crafted, efficient smartphone for around $ 200 bucks that works like a $400-500 dollar phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone!"
B0791VS3N9,Shawn,5,"Great battery life, nice build quality, excellent finger print sensor speed, and overall performance is much better than expected at this price point. This is the first non-flagship phone I've carried as a daily driver and I've been happily surprised."
B0791VS3N9,Wayne,1,"I would rate this product no star if there were such option. The Huawei Mate SE is VERY difficult to be recognized by computers & forever loading/connecting, either at home or at work. Functions are usually unstable. Got frozen frequently. I had to restart the phone on a daily basis. 2nd SIM is 2G. Swollen-headed Huawei designs its own interface, unfortunately NOT user friendly, even NOT logical. Caveat Emptor!!!!"
B0791VS3N9,Eric,2,"It feels so cheap, something about it is just off"
B0791VS3N9,Daniel Baker,2,"Loved this phone..
Had it about 3 months before the GPS antenna broke inside the phone. It never knew where I was, which is a massive problem for someone who already doesn't know where they are half the time.
Premium feel and design.
But performance after a month or two of use definitely suffered and ultimately rendered this phone unusable."
B0791VS3N9,More than that,1,"After almost a year of regular usage, I dropped the phone in water. I wasn't worried because the huawei mate se is advertised as waterproof, but after a few minutes, the power button and figerprint scanner malfunctioned. Now my phone is stuck in a loop of constantly force restarting. Very disappointed."
B0791VS3N9,jlayneman,5,"I have been using a Mate 2 for almost four years and it has been the best phone. I ordered the Mate SE to replace it, and I am very happy with it. Hope it gives me four more years of excellent usage."
B0791VS3N9,Rio,4,"The specifications say sim slot 2 only supports 2G but I think the better description is that only 1 sim at a time will support 4G which isn't a problem for me and maybe others as well. As shown in the pictures i've uploaded, whichever sim you select as the default data sim will have 2G/3G/4G and the other will have 2G so if you want to use data from the other sim you can simply switch in settings instead of having to remove the tray and switch the cards"
B0791VS3N9,Di,5,"Update: I have switched from Google Project Fi to Mint Mobile. Now I can receive/send MMS with no problem. I guess it was because of the setting of Project Fi.

This phone overall is good. However I can't receive or send MMS. I am in Hawaii and use Google Project Fi service.
Did some research on Internet and tried the APNs reset, still doesn't work. Sad. :("
B0791VS3N9,ugh...,1,"Problems with GPS/Bluetooth/WIFI due to its cheap antenna. No 5ghz... then super limited LTE bands on the device... No fast charging neither, very very slow. I bought this months ago and I was disappointed.

Now that I have Stylo 4, this is so much better in every aspects...

I wouldn't buy this product if I were you, and who knows when and how Huawei will declare that they will leave the US market due to sanctions, which makes this device pretty much obsolete when it comes to future support?"
B0791VS3N9,Bobby-head,1,Don't buy these Huawei cell phones. Chinese piece of junk. The settings move on their own that I don't want. Now I can't even use yahoo email anymore on this crappy phone.
B0791VS3N9,G. Liu,5,"Works perfectly with ATT, recognize your fingerprint in no time so it links to many of your accounts and opens up in seconds. I got another for my wife, and she loves it."
B0791VS3N9,Maine Sky King,1,"Its an android system JUNK GARBAGE.. TRASH Ill stick with Apple, thanks, but no thanks for this garbage.
This is America , we deserve better. USA USA"
B0791VS3N9,kidkjbiker,5,This is our second Huawei phone. We loved the speed and quality of the first one and decided to upgrade a second phone from an ASUS model. The screen size on this Mate is great especially for my large thumbs when trying to text. The phone has a great bright screen which provides good visual experience even in bright sunlight. The camera is fantastic and takes great quality pictures. This being the use of 2 lenses to get the right setting. I would recommend to family.
B0791VS3N9,Anonymous,1,"This phone is not worth the trouble. If you want a budget smartphone, you are better off with a Motorola.

Good:
- The camera is decent.

Bad:
- Poor battery life
- EMUI is worse than expected (It is like the software team looked at Android and tried to find ways to ruin it)
- Does not work properly with pebble smartwatches
- Vibration is not strong enough to feel in a pocket and there is not a way to change vibration intensity"
B0791VS3N9,Brandi Shipley,5,"I owned the Huawei Mate 7 and had a love hate with it. Hardware exceptional. Great performance hindered by terrible software, I vowed I never would again. I owned a Note 5 and a Moto Z since then, but fate decided to smash my moto. After 2 fairly expensive phones I decided to go budget. The sub 250 market isn't that great nowadays, but this little gem popped out at me at best buy. One left in the whole of Chicago, managed to snag last one, and I'm super impressed. Battery life is all day and more, performance is way above 250 dollars worth but don't expect Galaxy levels. Screen is great, software is much much better, but still needs work. But I'm super satisfied for this price. And I can buy 2 more before I approach galaxy prices.

All in all definitely recommend this as a buy."
B0791VS3N9,Not Available,1,Doesn't work. screen is defective
B0791VS3N9,hiu,1,Believe me when I say this is the worst phone in the USA. I DARE you to research this phone and you will agree. Besides that One small drop (with a case on it) and this phone is dust. Couldn't get my pics and other files off of it and I will never by a Huawei phone again.
B0791VS3N9,user,4,"Does not connect my Bluetooth speaker.
Selfie is not sharp face with beauty off.
Sound in not clear and no bass, worth than iPhone 5."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,4,"Great phone, I especially like the fingerprint reader for easy access and you can't beat the price for the tech. The only reason I can't give it 4 or 5 stars is that the black outlined text is jumbled and hard to read, (see attached photo). There is no space between the letters, it all just runs together, and is cheap looking. I downloaded a new font but it didn't change that particular text. If anyone knows how to change this particular font I'd appreciate the help. I asked in the questions section here and reached out to customer service but haven't heard back. Thanks.

Update, I decided to give it another star and keep the phone. I just hope I can change the font to make it more readable."
B0791VS3N9,Dorian Johnson,2,"Bought in March of 2018, just went dead on me for no reason today, November 23 2018. Otherwise was a great phone but would never buy this brand again."
B0791VS3N9,Omar,3,"The Mate SE is built very, very, well - it definitely feels like a premium phone and is an incredible value. Sticking with industrial design, the weakest points of the Mate SE are the front-facing logo (seriously, why? put a logo on the rear if you must), and the screen. The screen has a slight bit of grain to it. The grain is most visible on white content, e.g. in Google Now or if you open a new tab in Chrome. Might not be an issue for some.

The WORST thing about the SE is the software. It only ships with android 7.0, and EMUI is *awful*. I installed Nova, and even tried out a few EMUI themes to try and get the quick settings & settings menu to be more like stock Android. Then I found that Huawei had also replaced Android's standard 'share' menu (e.g. when one shares a photo from Google Photos to WhatsApp) with their own inferior version.

Huawei: please join the 'android one' program, and ship stock Android on your phones. This will also make it easier for you to provide OS updates for your phones.

If the Mate SE had stock Android, it would be fantastic. I can't accept EMUI though, and have returned the phone as a consequence. I highly recommend that anyone considering this phone purchase the Xiaomi Mi A1 instead - that's what I did. The Mi A1's build quality is excellent, it has no front-facing logo, and it is part of the android one initiative, running stock Android 8.0 - it is incredible. (It does have larger top & bottom bezels than the Mate SE, but in all other aspects the Xiaomi Mi A1 is better, or at least as good.)

Do NOT buy the Mate SE - get the Xiaomi Mi A1!

B0791VS3N9,Neptune,1,"The touch stopped responding after 43 days. I tried to recover or do a factory reset. But, it need some touch input. So I cannot use my phone now."
B0791VS3N9,jeeves,3,"My screen froze up and could not be fixed. I may have just gotten a bad phone, but...returned"
B0791VS3N9,Chambers,5,"Have this phone for two weeks, so far works great."
B0791VS3N9,Mike Chavez,5,"Awesome phone!! It's good for how much it costs I was scared at first because I had never bought a Huawei phone before, but now I know I was totally worth it!"
B0791VS3N9,pbandyo,4,"I bought the phone through Walmart. Have been using about a month. Quite decent display at this pricepoint. Very nice dimensions - big screen but lightweight and easy to hold. Fast and responsive. Fingerprint scanner is excellent! Doesn't heat up during long calls. Battery life is good. Sound is mediocre but can be boosted with volume booster app.
Two things I miss are fast or wireless charging and No NFC."
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,"I have been using this phone for six months now. The build quality, battery, camera is good. But touch screen is horrible. I am having smartphone thumb symptoms (painful thumb injury because of touch screen stress) because of this phone. Won't recommend to anyone. Not worth it."
B0791VS3N9,EDK,5,Best smartphone value for the price. It's smooth and powerful with a huge memory. Everything works perfectly! Great display! Camera has great software and features but I think my Moto g5 camera is a little bit better. All in all a Great deal.
B0791VS3N9,Sad and disappointed,3,I have poor reception in my area. I relay on wifi calling when I'm home. its not supported so I'm out of luck
B0791VS3N9,Louise,5,"Great phone, only problem is that no good screen protectors are sold for it."
B0791VS3N9,Michael Cicero,5,Perfect budget smartphone!

Great battery life even playing with the game that uses high resources. Glass screen not the greatest stick with gorilla glass this phone screen cracks much easier. The other major issue is when you're at work can you multimedia So that you'll hear your phone ring if someone calls but not here getting notifications and other stuff. Everything comes through the phone profile so you're going to always hear your games notifications and other stuff. The only way to do fix that is to mute phone but then you'll never hear your phone ring if you really need to. This also only has one speaker so it's not stereo. I had contacted the company and they said that this is there practice on this phone that everything plays through the ringer volume. So you even if you're on the phone and a game or message comes through it will play as if that person has it on their phone in this playing it at that time. Don't get this phone if you keep your phone on at a job and keep the ringer on to hear if an emergency. Because everything plays through the ringer messages games everything"
B0791VS3N9,Tony T,5,The best phone for its price range.

Sometimes it's freeze or crash for the money $300.00 you can get much better phones... don't buy it the customer service is terrible and if it's get something defective they won't help you...!! You're are on your own...just get Samsung or Motorola"
B0791VS3N9,Madhu,5,Great phone for $220. Using it since 6 months and never had any problem. Great battery back up. I get almost 2 days per charge easily(low usage). Great camera and picture edit options.

B0791VS3N9,Ahdewr,5,"I got a Honor V10 directly from the HiHonor store and had been using it for 2 weeks. I tried to write a review for it but Amazon won't let me so I leave my review here. All I have to say is the picture does not do it justice and you really have to see it in person. The phone is fantastic and I agree with most other reviews on the internet it is best mid-range phone you can get for $500. Trust me, just get it. I heard Huawei is moving out of the American market, what a shame, damn those dirty politicians."
B0791VS3N9,Cornelius Booker III,3,"I ordered this phone for my mother. Everything was great with the setup except when we tried to connect to WiFi, we kept getting an error ""WiFi - Denied Access to Network"". We tried everything to include resetting the phone back to factory settings. Still no luck! Other phones connected to the house WiFi with no problems. I ordered a replacement phone. I'll update my review.....only if it works like its supposed to.

Update: I finally discovered a fix by accident. First...take the phone to a carrier store to have them set it up and connect it to their network. My mother is on T-mobile. Second...go to a public place like Starbucks and use their wi-fi to complete all the phone updates. Headsup...you will be there for a while so make sure you have plenty of power. Once finished you should be on latest Android version 7.1. You can now go home and connect to your personal network. The phone no longer has any issues nor receive that stupid error anymore. Good-Luck!"

B0791VS3N9,Dmitry G.,2,"I had to return it since when the screen brightness is set to ""Auto"" the phone dims the screen too aggressively. For example, you set the screen brightness to 50%, you put the phone down and after a minute you pick it up. The brightness will be set to 25% only and this is very annoying since you have to readjust it every time. This bug has been reported for many Huawei phones, even the more expensive ones and has been discussed on many hardware and software forums. Huawei, seemingly, assumes this is a ""cool feature"" to save battery and does nothing about it."
B0791VS3N9,BB,5,"Dear R. Lundquist (or is that your CIA Handle?), Please update us all if you know which Chinese manufacturers are sneaking those microscopic metallic threads into our ""Made in China"" clothing, shoes, auto upholstery, etc. Those metallic threads beam signals to their Global Positioning Satellites and that's how they track our movements. I think there's a tiny audio listening device inside one of my pillows, and get this (!), I bought it brand new & when I got it home & took it out of the plastic, someone had already removed the ""Do Not Remove Tag""....How suspicious is that!?! Do you think I should throw it away? OR, do you think it would be in the best interest of national security for me to give it to the CIA? Hmmm?? Of course, I already know that I would need to drive it to Wash, DC and hand deliver it--we all know about the treason going on in the back of most of the US Postal mail carriers. They even painted them all to look the same just to fool us--AS IF!!"
B0791VS3N9,Amazon Customer,1,Purchased from Walmart and returned for refund. Screen and outer case are very cheaply made. Not amoled glass as advertised by the manufacturer. No way to move apps to sd card to conserve internal storage space. Cannot encrypt sd card. Slow and laggy compared to the s9 with the same stats.
B0791VS3N9,Spyro,3,"What a great phone, BUT WHAT A SHAME, NO 5GHz WiFi!
Once you see this phone in person, You'd be W O W ! ! !
This is such a very SLEEK phone and very fast.
Everything on this phone is really good. Screen occupies most of the face, and the buttons can be customized since they are on the display.
I was going crazy finding my wifi router just to FIND OUT THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz. My my router is dual band, but can only transmit either 2.4 or 5GHz, not both at the same time. My kids won't let me choose 2.4 since it's slower and 2.4 is obviously not as good as the 5GHz.
I am not going to mention all the good stuffs, since there is too much of them.

BUT HERE ARE THE CONS:
- NO 5GHz WiFi
- NO WiFi Calling
- NO Wireless charging capability
- NOT a Type C fast charging
- If these things don't bother you, BUY IT, no brainer

I use T-Mobile. At my work, inside the building, only Verizon works. AMAZINGLY, I was able to use this phone ( with one bar). No iPhones or Samsung ever worked at my work unless your WiFi calling is ON or have Verizon. Although, this don't have Wi-Fi calling, I was able to use it at work.

THIS PHONE LOOKS LIKE AN iPHONE WITH ANDROID OS."
B0791VS3N9,F. Simpson,1,I'm not really sure what I'm paying for. It's more expensive than the most expensive Blu phones and yet the performance is nowhere near on par. The OS is laggy and apps open slower than on a lower end phone. Why the hell should I have to enter a lock screen password after 3 days if i'm the only person in the world who has my fingerprint? This phone is overpriced and the performance is not impressive in the least.
B0791VS3N9,Sokski,2,"Not crisp as stated, SE must stand for S..t Edition"
B0791VS3N9,MacsBaby47,1,"I HATE THIS PHONE!!! If I had not threw away the box I would have send this piece of a phone back. It is the worse phone I have had in over 10 yrs. Yes I read the reviews and all in all the phone received 4 stars, when only 1 star should have been given. I paid 249.99 and I am very unhappy. I have to buy another phone. The phone is always dropping calls, major problem. When its the only phone you have to use."
B0791VS3N9,MK,2,"I really wanted to like the phone and I did. I was actually so excited the first few days when I got the phone. The camera is great, it looks and feels like a great phone (I just switched from apple and got sick of the terrible service and battery etc). However, it was too good to be true. I've not used androids before and a lot of the apps that I wanted to use were available like whatsapp, fitbit. However, the phone is really slow - I read that it might be because the wifi and bluetooth use the same antenna. I will try it but whatsapp video calling was an absolute nightmare with this phone - constant lag. And I also just learnt today that fitbit is not compatible with Huawei phones due to the some issue with their bluetooth and apple earphones don't work with thhs. So it depends on what you're used to and what you are using your phone for- apps that are fairly common may not work well (if they work at all) with this phone. I'm not sure if I will return it but I can't really afford another iphone. :(."

B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,4,"This phone is a great phone, especially for kids.

I took a star off because the software could be better. There should be no bloat on a phone with these specs, and unfortunately BLU insists on trying to install Facebook and other crappy apps on the phone.

If you want to make this phone faster you can do what I did:
1) Let phone run through its updates
2) Disable and uninstall unneeded apps
3) Under privacy settings, enable installing apps from unknown sources
4) Install F-Droid (google the link). F-Droid is an app that lets you install free and open-source software, much of it lighter than other non-free apps.
5) From F-Droid you can try: Lightning Browser (faster than Opera or Chrome), KISS Launcher (replaces built in launcher), Blokada (system wide ad blocker), and NewPipe (youtube replacement with no ads or fluff). If you insist on using Facebook, get FaceSlim replacement on F-Droid.

It took me a couple hours messing with the phone to do all these steps because the updates and disabling of apps takes awhile, but the phone has a lot more free space now and uses less RAM. It runs like it has twice the processor now."
B072N6BD9V,JuanitoVerde,5,"I'm 88 years old, don't wear glasses, and don't text, but I wanted a smart phone just for pleasure. I've had two BLU phones. I will compare and contrast them, in the event you are shopping.
I had an Advance 5.2 for some weeks. It has an all-metal case that will not open. You need to put a tiny tool in a tiny hole in one side, and out will come a tiny tray that will hold only a small SD card, and a nano sim. That's it. The size is great, and it seems well-made. I was wanting something larger, so reading text would be easier, and I don't plan on using it as a phone that much, so I was looking at the Advance A6. I received it yesterday, and I am delighted. What's great is that the entire back comes off, and you can access two sim slots and an SD slot with the battery out or left in. My hands are large, so the size isn't an issue, but it might be awkward for petite ladies. I also had a Blackberry Leap, which wouldn't even look at sims I tried, so back it went. The A6 greedily accesses sims and memory cards with glee. If there is any down-side, it could be battery endurance, but I will not make a judgment on that until my experiments are concluded. You are advised to do a few cycles of full to empty, and I'm awaiting hitting empty for the first time. It doesn't seem to suck out much power on idle, so I guess I'll have to task it a bit to drain the sucker out. At this point, I couldn't be a happier camper. I sincerely hope this helps you."
B072N6BD9V,Jamgirl1,1,"This phone is a beautiful piece of crap! The phone arrived on time, I took the phone out of the box and fell in love with the design, size and color of it. But within a day of using it, I wanted to throw it against the wall! I followed the advice of some of the reviews which recommend a purchase of an SD card, and purchase a 64gb SD card along with the phone, and it was like it was not even in the phone. I couldn't even use the phone in peace! The apps keeps stopping. I would get notification after notification that this or that app has stopped, and do I want to close it, or wait? I even followed the advice of one reviewer and disabled some of the apps and downloaded Fdroid, and then download some apps through there, and follow all the steps recommended. Facebook was one of the app that I got the most notifications for. So
Delete Facebook and get Faceslim. That helps with the constant notifications that an app had stopped but it didn't stop the apps from stopping, or closing, or with the freezing and crashing of the phone. I'd be on a call and the phone would freeze up or turn off completely! And the only way to get it to turn back on was to remove and replace the battery. The screen keeps blocking out with a blue square around it, and the back key can't bring it back home. I have to use the home key and it would just go right back to a blank, black screen with a blue line around it. The only thing helps a little is to remove the battery and reinstall it. I rebooted the phone so many times I have headaches! I wish I'd never bought this phone. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy! If I had one. The one star is because I couldn't submit my review without selecting a ð."
B072N6BD9V,Kindle Customer,5,"The BLU A6 Phone exceeds expectations with a great screen, dual cameras, Dual Sims, and strong performance, as well as a very reasonable price. One caution - you will likely need to buy a ""Bring Your Own Phone"" Sim Card to get compatibility. I went to Walmart,, my cell plan provider & they had a package for that at $57, but told me I could order it online from them for $1 plus about $7 in shipping. They even helped me order it. Getting it activated was a bit more trouble, but once done works great. Amazon should offer the Sim with the Phone and save us the trouble and extra shipping. Add 2 SIMS as it does support dual SIM Cards."
B072N6BD9V,Mike B Sr.,5,"This phone is great so far. Super easy to setup and get working on my phone plan thru my carrier. Sound is great on calls and seems to work perfectly for me.Has a one yr warranty which is is to set up first thing using you phone.Came with a screen protector, ear bud headset to both added an added plus as I see it. I have seen this phone in one of the big box store for 30 bucks more. I've haven't seen any down side so far with this phone. Need a new phone so this is it. I'm not one to use a phone for web or gaming I have far better devices for that it's a phone to me So it has all the bells and whistles I want plus more I'd believe there. I would recommend it to anyone needing good phone without breaking they bank to get one."
B072N6BD9V,Zacc,5,"Phone works great. Very responsive, fast, and great picture. Only thing misleading is the second nano sim slot is the SD card slot. Cannot use both, is an either or. I only have one phone plan, so no big deal. I use the SD slot for my Amazon music. Swipe keyboard is great, predictive text works awesome. Only complaint is that there are almost no cases available. Does come with a clear flexible case."
B072N6BD9V,RvnS,5,I am pleasantly suprised. The software is great. The phone is not glitchy and has a pretty fast touch to react time. Overall this is a great phone for someone on a budget. Also as an added bonus it came with a screen protector and case.
B072N6BD9V,Pris,5,Very nice. Impressed that it came with a case and screen protector for that price.
B072N6BD9V,Omega,3,"This is a nice phone and for the low price for a 6"" phone, I knew the modest specs and didn't expect spectacular performance.
Good display - color and sharpness
Good mic for dictation in my email writing
Has OTG function which I formatted to FAT32
Nice feel and handling of phone.
Although ROM is 8 GB, it has about 4 GB for user; better than the big name phones with their unremovable bloat ware or those from the phone carriers (AT&T bloat ware even hogs the display).

The speaker volume is quite low even at max - not good for listening to lecture MP3 recordings
Most apps take a second or two to run, which is acceptable in view of low price.
When surfing and youtube watching, battery lasts between 3 - 4 hr inspite of estimates displayed as 6 hr.

What pushed me to return it was that every day when powering up, it would not recognize my micro SD card, and needs to be rebooted. I notice that even in a few Samsung reviews people complained of the same problem. Though not a common problem in phones, the hassle is not worth it. One time, the BLU just froze up, black screen, and refused to budge. So I plugged in the power, push the on-off button few times and it work. Strange because the battery was about 70% remaining.

If you are lucky in not encountering this non-recognizing SD problem, then it is a good phone for the low price. I have two other BLU phones for 3 years which perform well, even in the rough treatment when boarding planes and scanning the Boarding Pass on the BLU screen on many flights in Europe. My BLU phones work very well for phone calls in Europe and Asia using their local SIMs."
B072N6BD9V,Carlos Ortiz,4,"I was a little skeptical about this product at first. It started and did everything slow but I think it was just because it was still loading apps in the background and trying to keep up with my tasking. Now that the few apps that I will use are loaded it performs at an ""ok"" speed. Comparatively speaking, but for $69.00 phone, it performs at great speed. The few Apps eat up a lot of memory fairly quickly so adding a micro SD card is a must. I recommend starting with an SD card from the very beginning so that you can put the Apps on the SD rather than internal memory. This will help greatly. Moving apps from internal to external (SD) card is not as easy later. I had to delete some (not all) Apps and then reload to the SD card to free up space.
It is important to mention that the apps, once installed on the SD card perform just as fast as they do in my iPhone7. The only difference is that they OPEN a little slower on this phone as compared to my ($800) iphone7.
I bought this phone to replace my Garmin GPS on my motorcycle since I can use Pandora, Waze (and/or Google maps) and Bluetooth all at once for half the price of a decent GPS that can't play these apps.
The screen definition is very good, the map font is larger than a GPS (good for those with ""tired"" eyes like mine). I used the Rockform Universal phone mount to mount it to my T&T Fab batwing fairing mount.
Oh, and to the surprise of the AT&T rep. this phone DOES work in the AT&T network."
B072N6BD9V,HH,1,"While I believe that this phone may work for some people, as with all cheap electronics, clearly quality control is very low. Mine started to freeze within 24 hours of receiving it, until it got to the point I could literally not even activate the reboot/shutdown options, and the screen largely stopped receiving input, which makes all the other ways of judging a phone irrelevant since it's completely unstable. It did work ok for a few hours, maybe 8, before the touch screen simply stopped working, or worked totally erratically.
I've bought cheap phones before, like the Posh, and had really good luck with them, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Basically understand that you are gambling on getting a phone that works for $59 (Advance 5.2), apparently this gamble works for some users, and if you read the reviews, many have similar experiences to mine. Not worth the headache of spending time returning it in my opinion.
Sad thing is, the case is pretty nice, the screen seemed fine, quality wise, but they just didn't spend the money they needed to on the rest of the hardware, maybe think about spending 20 to 30 more on the screen and internals and sell that for $80, that's about what Posh did, and it seemed to do the trick."
B072N6BD9V,Nora J Bailey,4,"So, I write this to help others that I thinking about possibly purchasing this home. I think it is a great value for the cost. I read through all of it reviews and found some that were quite inaccurate. The phone works and functions just fine. Yes it might not be up to a premium iPhone or other Android as far as speed however there are things that you can do to minimize lag. I ran into similar issues as others have mentioned but with one simple fix it has seemed to alleviate all of the problems. The main source of memory consumption seems to have been the Google Assistant. ""okay Google"". After going into the settings and disabling this acrossed the entire platform my phone is three times as fast as it was initially prior to me making this adjustment. I highly advise anyone to disable this feature because it sits in the background wasting memory and causes other applications to lag and not function correctly. I hope this helps other people."
B072N6BD9V,Anonymous,5,"I use both this phone and iPhone. The iPhone cost more than ten times what this BLU did, and I think they work about the same. They both have all the same functionality and are about as easy to use. This is excellent technology that just works. It was the cheapest phone I could find. It works just as well as the most expensive. I am very happy customer. Long battery life. Fast charge times. Standard accessories. Easy set up."
B072N6BD9V,Tazbeaux,2,"I bought this as my first smart phone, so I feel that my opinion isn't clouded by having used a more expensive phone in the past. I really wanted to love this phone, but it just didn't happen. Maybe I got a bad one. What I liked about the phone was... Its compact size and how it fit in my pocket and hand. The phone came with a case and screen protector. The display was very crisp and bright. The wifi hotspot feature worked really well and had decent range. The problems I had with this phone were... The sound quality during phone calls was bad, I had trouble hearing even with the volume all the way up, also the other party had trouble hearing/understanding me. When connected to my desktop via usb cable the phone showed up as an empty folder that wouldn't even allow me to move files into it. I also tried connecting to the phone via bluetooth and the phone wouldn't pair with any other device. I tried using it with my Square credit card chip reader and it didn't work. However it did work with the older magstripe reader. The battery life was also bad, a 1 hour phone call would almost totally deplete a full charge. I returned this phone and purchased a Doogee X10, very happy with that phone."
B072N6BD9V,Mike,5,"I cracked my Galaxy S9+ screen, and sent it back to Samsung to get a factory repair. I bought this phone to use for the next week or two... Wow... Listen, it is not fast, it doesn't have an HD screen, but OMG, it does EVERYTHING my S9+ can do (a little slower) and it is 60 dollars!!!!

I had to buy a sim card adapter (3 bucks) to put my nano sim in the micro slot, but that's it... It runs on ATT 4G, youtube works, directv app works, messaging, whats app, it all works... It is unreal...."
B072N6BD9V,Happy Customer,4,"This is a decent, inexpensive phone . It has a very large screen, beautiful for watching YouTube,Amazon prime video etc. Functions well in use as a phone and video player. This does not have much RAM or storage room however so if you like a lot of apps, this phone probably isn't for you. It does work reasonably well for Facebook and Messenger. It quickly fills up when apps are updated and you get constant warnings that you are running out of space. It has a lot of preinstalled apps that not everyone uses and they take a lot of space. Japanese input keyboard is one such app that I have no use for and cannot remove. I was also annoyed that Blu has surreptitiously added more such useless apps into it's system update such as a Blu rewards app that is basically bombarding your phone with advertisements for which you can earn rewards for interacting with. Super annoying! You cannot remove this app once installed with the update . Again-super annoying as it takes up valuable limited space. This can thankfully at least be disabled. To be fair, this phone does say it will accept a large capacity memory card however I have not tried this yet and it may resolve some issues. I have noticed what I'm calling a bit of instability in the system as it sometimes seems to open random apps at it's own volition. So to sum up. ...it's a decent basic smartphone for the casual user. Great for on the go video entertainment, not so great for a multitude of apps. It does come beautifully packaged, comes with some decent earbuds and a plastic case for protection. Probably a great phone for elderly users do to large screen size or for youngsters wanting their first smartphone or as I've said before great for watching videos. I hope this review is helpful!"

B072N6BD9V,guillermo rivas,5,"It is an excellent phone in relation to its price. I'm delighted with the camera that gets sharp and clear images. The downside is that it has very little RAM capacity (1GB) and some programs and games do not run very fast, but it is compensated with the storage capacity of 8GB and expandable up to 64GB. This is great for those who love taking pictures and videos. Another good thing is the Android 7.0 operating system that is super fast! It has many positive characteristics such as the size of the screen, adequate weight, resistant material and as a special addition the package includes a silicone protective liner and a protective screen film. What else can you ask for this price?"

B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,"I gave this phone 2 stars because of the low price. That being said, you get what you pay for. The phone is constantly freezing up. It doesn't connect to most WiFis. It doesn't save my settings when I set different ringtones or alerts. This is my first experience with a Blu device and I'm sure it will be my last."

Comes with ear buds that have volume control and a clear standard case to cover the phone. I suggest getting a shock absorption case along with tempered glass protector for extra long life. The screen is huge! But still fits comfortably in the palm of one hand."
B072N6BD9V,Frenchy,2,"Model Warning!!!
The BLU A5 Energy aka A250 does not exist. It is the Gray version of the BLU Grand Energy G130.
The box/package reads ""Grand Energy"" with an added ""A5"" sticker on it.
The only reference to A250EQ is on the proof-of-purchase/bardode sticker on and inside the box.
The quick guide inside clearly shows the Gold version of the Grand Energy.
The inside booklet tells you to go to the eu.bluproducts site for user manuals and warranty, yet the site has no reference to A5 Energy, but Grand Energy.
The phone ""About device"" section reads ""Grand Energy"" as Model number, as well as a reference to G130 in the Custom build version.
The bluproducts site has an empty ""Energy Series"" section, and does not reference a BLU A5 Energy anywhere.
When searching the web for A5 Energy, specifications sites will reference Android 7.0 Nougat while in fact, you'll get Android 6.0 Marshmallow as expected with Grand Energy.
etc ...

Also

Dual SIM beware!
BLU's reply to buried Amazon product review comments reveals the Dual SIM feature is a hybrid, as the microSD card has to be removed (if any) to insert a second SIM card. Besides, no info is given on the dualSIM technology used such as DSS (single stand-by), DSA (active), or DSDS (dual stand-by), not even on the Dual SIM Installation Guide inside.

MicroSD beware!
The sales flyer/doc (Grand Energy) on BLU site - as well as the ""From the manufacturer"" section (A5 Energy) on Amazon - will promote twice ""8GB Internal Memory, expandable to 64GB"" while scrolling further down the exact same page will read ""MicroSD up to 32GB"".
Is SDXC (>32GB) not supported? only SDHC (<=32GB) is supported? or is SDXC supported but limited to 64GB?

Conclusion.
The value for the money seems great, but the deceitful old/new rebranding is upsetting, and the technical information in order to make a sound choice for the customer is fundamentally lacking.

Edit: answer from BLU ""The A5 energy is an Amazon exclusive line, the hardware may be the same but the software have been optimize for a better customer experience. We can confirm the A5 energy supports Micro SD up to 32GB"".
What exactly has been optimized? We don't know. And the ""expandable to 64GB"" claim from the manufacturer on Amazon is false."
B072N6BD9V,Tandy J. Howard,5,"Just received it!! So far I'm impressed. Speedy,..with a big, bright screen. Not sure you can beat it for the money. As always, Amazon's delivery was incredible!!"
B072N6BD9V,The Andersons,3,"Mine came with Android 8.1 Go, and not too much bloatware - no Facebook app or any of the stuff some of the other users mentioned. However, right out of the box it was extremely slow. I tried everything the other reviewers suggested, and I'd highly recommend:
1. Disable 'google hello' and anything resembling it. No ""OK Google"" or ad suggestions or any of that
2. F-Droid + Lightning browser, then disable Chrome and Youtube
3. Get a FAST SD card and format it as an extension of internal storage - in theory you'll have more SWAP space for when your phone runs out of RAM
4. Lightning launcher (or your light launcher of choice)

Having done that, I actually like this phone. For $40, it's pretty reliable and up to date. I use it primarily for taking calls as an IT technician. The call quality is good, the screen is readable, and the battery life is fine. I can google things when I'm in the hardware store, and I can send Google Voice messages to clients. If that's all you need, it works just fine. The physical build quality is pretty good, I like the button placement and the screen looks fine. I love that the entire rear of the phone snaps on like a case instead of having a little panel, that's a really smart idea.

HOWEVER, there are a few things this phone just will not do, no matter what I've tried:
- Navigation. I don't think it has a GPS module at all, it relies on cell tower and wifi networks to get location. Google Maps will barely run, and none of the alternatives will ever actually get your location no matter how long you wait
- Fitbit. It will run, it will connect, and it will not stay connected to save its life
- Outlook and other larger office apps will drag it to its knees. Luckily, Gmail GO edition now supports exchange, which is working fine for me
- Facebook. I use Messenger Lite to talk to people, but if you want full-featured chat heads and facebook posts, you do NOT want this phone. You'd have an easier time hiring a guy to physically travel to facebook's servers, draw you a picture of your feed, and travel back.

In short, this phone is extremely low-end, but is a pretty good telephone that will also run some apps. If what you need is a facebook browser that can also call people, you're going to want to spend about 10x as much and get a real phone."
B072N6BD9V,Carl Barbee,4,"It's a great phone. However, when looking at BLUs website, it would seem that the A6 does not even exist. There is not mention of it anywhere. Oversight?"
B072N6BD9V,Leedon1,1,"The phone is extremely slow, whenever I upload apps on the phone it freezes and also when I'm launching an app its taking forever to open.....omg it's so frustrating.
I even got an 32 GB SD card to see if it will increase the speed and it's the same feed back, at present I only have 1 app installed just to get a little more speed.
I bought the phone because I wanted an upgrade and also the reviews were so good it caught my interest, I'm so disappointed with Blu Advance A6 it's so useless to me right now."
B072N6BD9V,QmC,1,"This is absolutely the most horrendous phone I have ever had. What's with the gd ads every 2 minutes, even when the phone is off and just sitting there in the coffee table minding its own business, here comes some strange music to and add even when the screen is off.... So slow it's unimaginable. And it would randomly so things on its own while you're in the mode of a txt , another app pops up!!!! Terrible worst phone ever!!! WARNING... DONOT BUY"
B072N6BD9V,Deveron Patterson,2,"First off, It's rather strange but I did not receive the phone I order. It's supposed to be a ADVANCE-A6 device, though it says on the overall packaging which was delivered good. But when I uploaded the information, its called a Studio Mega, why I don't know?! The phone for the most, works and for the very low price-you cannot expect too much with the bells and whistles like you'd get out of the more expensive phones. But I at least expect the features to work which they don't!
1. VOLUME- HORRIBLE!!! Barely can hear when the device rings, no matter how loud its set,
2. NOTIFICATIONS- Terrible also! Sometimes this feature works and sometimes it doesn't.
3. LED NOTIFICATION - WORSE! Does NOT WORK AT ALL! There is NO light to indicate incoming messages, sms/texts, or voicemail calls.
4. BATTERY- HORRIBLE! You have to charge 2 or 3x daily, but depending upon if you don't play a lot of games and use a lot of apps battery is okay.
This phone would be good for emergencies when you're in between cellphone-devices or just need for a point of contact."
B072N6BD9V,Bree T,1,"I bought this phone as a cheap back-up phone when traveling, but it wouldn't acknowledge my T-Mobile SIM card. The product description said it works with T-Mobile. I have been dealing directly with the Blu manufacturer and they have sent me 2 more phones and none of them will acknowledge my T-Mobile SIM card. This is the SIM card that I have been using in my main phone all this time, so it is not the SIM card."
B072N6BD9V,Jnkal,1,"Love the size; the ease of use and how good it looks. Will update review if I discover any issues

Update on review.
I would NOT recommend you buy this phone. It looks great but it is very useless. It keeps freezing and crashing. I have reset it twice I think, and I don't even use it everyday. It was meant to be a backup phone but it has been very slow, and buggy. Additionally after just having it for less than 5 months, the thing is now dead and won't turn on after trying to charge it for 2 days!!
Very useless. Contacting Blu and hopefully I can get my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL OF BLU"
B072N6BD9V,Tee Bee,1,These are more like tablets not phones lol ..I was excited these worked well for a few days only then they started to malfunction terribly sad part is I bought two of these for my kids now they are so sad the top peice fell off one and they did send me a replacement only for the tablet to not even be placed together all the way I had to push it down to snap it in place.. what a shame save your money you get what you pay for .
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,"I was hoping for an inexpensive phone for one of my kids. One that would function, without the need for bells, whistles, and high performance. Out of the box all seemed well. It powered up and recognized the T-Mobile SIM, but that's where the fun ended. The one thing that needed to work was the phone's antenna, or reception. While we enjoy 4 bars at the house on our $500 phones, we barely got 1 bar on this BLU phone. Sending a 'test' text message took 7 minutes. If that wasn't enough, there was a speaker issue. When we finally got a call to connect there wasn't any sound. I'll also add that the device ran pretty slow...opening apps, etc. But, again, the antenna quality on the phone is a key issue. We're going to have spend the money and get a higher quality device. I'll give 2 stars because it did power up and recognize the SIM, but performance is dreadful."
B072N6BD9V,tjh,5,Ordered it for a friend. She seems to like it. She ended up getting 2 Because Amazon failed to deliver the first one on time lol. So far so good!
B072N6BD9V,Amazing Phil,4,"First of all let me say that I love this phone. The only reason I knocked a star off is because if you want a two sim phone, you cannot have an SD card installed. That's right. You have to choose between having one sim and one SD card or two sims, an no SD card. Fortunately for me, I only need choice number 1. The other reason is that the battery is not easily removable. If I ever need to replace the battery, I'm sure it could be done, but it will be a major pain. I wound up buying this phone because I originally had the BLU Advance 5.0 for over two years with no problems at all. My significant other needed a new phone that was reliable, and simple to operate. I wanted to buy her a BLU Advance 5.0 because I am very familiar with Android 5, and I knew she would like it. It was not available new, so I purchased a used one through Amazon Warehouse Deals. I had purchased a Kindle that way and had no problems, so I went for it. The only problem was that it didn't work right, so I had to return it. I was a little worried about trying another used one, so I found this one for only $9.00 more. When it arrived I gave her my old phone which she is happy with. I am pretty happy with more ram, a larger curved screen, Android 7, metal case, etc... Something interesting though, The packaging, and sticker on the back say ""Blu Advance 5.2"", but the software in the phone identifies it as a ""Blu Grand M2"" I did a little research and discovered that Blu no longer lists the Advance 5.2 on the web site, but they do list the Grand M2. The phones are exactly the same, so I'm thinking that it underwent a model name change. What this means is that you can shop for cases and screen protectors for both models, and they should work.
I will, as usual, update this review if anything interesting develops.

Update #1 5/6/18 Because this phone has a 2.5D curved screen, finding a glass screen protector that fits it properly is basically impossible. You will, at this time anyway, have to settle for one that won't fully cover the screen, and still have a ""halo"" around the edges."
B072N6BD9V,PABLOMAN,1,"I was anticipating the arrival of this phone for my daughter. I knew that by the description AND the price that this was NOT going to be a $1000 iPhone. I bought it for the sole reason to keep in contact with her and her to us. She did want to put a couple of little kids' games on it, so that was more than feasible. Easy to set up, worked well with her Speedtalk sim card, no problems there. Upon going through it, personalizing it and downloading a couple of children's apps, I noticed sufficient lag time between pressing a button and the response time. I would hit the ""play"" button on a game and it would literally take about 10 seconds for it to respond. This was consistent for all of the games. Its processing capabilities were beyond slow. It was one of those ""keep hitting the button, that will make it go"" kind of deals. It was frustrating enough that we decided to return it and try our luck with one that was $20 more and seemed to have better speed to it. Again, I knew going in that it would not be blistering speed, but it was just way too slow. If all you need this phone for is to make phone calls, this would work as it did well talking and video chatting (though the video was not clear as could be and lagging)."
B072N6BD9V,Deivis AÃ±anguren,5,"excellent phone, light easy to use and the best you can use it in another country, recommended"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,3,Loved the looks and feel of the phone. It looks and feels much more expensive than it was. Beautiful picture. I installed a 32gb card before starting it up as a couple of other reviews had suggested. But I was very disappointed with the service. Very slow...I mean VERY slow. Constantly getting locked up and having to be rebooted time after time. I hated having to send it back because it is a very good looking phone with beautiful picture. I am member of Amazon Prime and wished to use this phone to watch movies and the other benefits of Amazon Prime..
B072N6BD9V,Zeal Aspen,4,"This is a good phone, it's slow but I'm able to stay connected with people I know.

When I got my phone, I had an issue setting it up; thankfully I was able to chat with an Amazon Technician who was extremely patient and walked me through every step of the phones Diagnostic System... now it works just fine (that could of been just me). The picture quality is poor, but in a pinch if you need it, at least you have a camera you can use. As for this phones battery life, I can get about two or two and a half days on one charge... but that's only because I don't have a Data Plan and my phone isn't constantly connected to the net. My father on the other hand has the same phone, he's not entirely happy with it either; sometimes I hear him complaining that the battery power doesn't last long... maybe about two thirds of a day before it needs a boost or full charge (his phone is always using Data). I think a nice feature of the phone was the automatic startup tutorial when I turned it on while setting up the phone, unless you're from the stone age or are technically challenged; using this phone isn't hard... it's different and you'll have to acclimate to it, but it basically works like most touch screen smart phones.

So in the end, I think I'll settle for 4 stars. The speed at which the phone process information and app handling could be improved a bit, but for an unlocked phone at this price; I'm satisfied."
B072N6BD9V,Blackwell,1,"Works fine as a tablet for what I need it, ham radio apps, maps, and weather radar/storm spotting apps. Didn't intend to use it as a phone so the poor reviews regarding being used a such did not bother me.

12/31/2018: Have used this tablet very little, picked it up today and the screen was completely separated from the tablet. It wasn't dropped or anything, however it was in my vehicle overnight with temps in the upper 30Â°s. I have only had this tablet since April. I will likely superglue it back in place but this really shouldn't have happened. Dropped to 1 star."
B072N6BD9V,DaddyAr,4,"Just received the phone today 7/2/18. So far the phone has a great feel and sleek look. The A6 came with a charger and cord, as well as, a USB charging cord, it did have a clear case and face protector included. Transferring the sim and storage cards to the phone was easy, and I even downloaded an app to view how long it would take, Surprisingly, it fast. I'll give another update in a week to relate if the phone is of good quality."
B072N6BD9V,Robert Jones,3,"I bought this phone to replace a Blu Life X phone that got caught in a downpour. I had been very pleased with Blu phones, but I must say that this phone was a let down. I realize that you get what you pay for and that this is a low cost, low end smart phone, but almost immediately it started shutting down apps that had been pre-installed on the phone because they weren't responding. There is very little space on the phone, 8 gigs is just not enough and I don't really add much as I am not a gamer nor do I use my phone to stream video, which is a good thing, because this phone has trouble with that. It was very sluggish and the battery life diminished after only a couple of months. The apps that I added for my smart home devices would not function and it had difficulty viewing web pages that contained any kind of pop ups or advertising such as news feeds. The screen is large and the display is satisfactory. It takes decent photos but would not save or open them on the phone and if you added an SD card, you had to set it up almost exclusively for the camera as an external drive which means that you can't use the SD card as an internal drive to store and access downloaded apps you have to save the photos on the SD card and then upload them to Google photos to be able to see them. This creates extra steps and more time just to take and view the photos. I think that this would be a good, inexpensive option if you wanted to get a phone for your kids, but it is not a very practical alternative if you need the phone for your personal everyday use, especially if you depend on your phone for any work related usage."
B072N6BD9V,Olyve Oil,1,"I was excited to receive my new Blu 5.2. It is a larger than my R1 HD. The setup was easy. Operation straight forward. Camera quality looks good.

The issue appeared quickly. Apps loaded on my phone would disappear. I would go back and try to download them again and get an error message. I have made a number of calls to Blu support, gone through their diagnostics only to be told to do a factory reset. They also stated this would not affect my SD card. When you do the reset you must reformat the SD card. So I was able to get the phone working properly but would loose everything I had.

After months of this Blu finally offers to fix the phone. There is now an issue. A very small crack at the bottom left corner. I knocked the phone off my chair arm. They now say this voice a!l warranty and I just pay for repair and a new screen. But he screen does not affect operation or serviceability.

I had been a big fan of Blu. It looks like they are pushing me away now. Stay away from a company that will not support their product. I had tried multiple times to get this resolved before tbe ""physical damage"". Blu would not support their product."
B072N6BD9V,Rita parker,4,Just got my phone a few days ago and it's a good looking phone for the money the colors are vivid and bright and the camera works well so it's too soon to say but I have been purchasing Blu phones for the last 5 years and I hope this advance phone last and works up to its my expectations and does not disappoint .I am giving this phone 4 stars maybe it's jumping the gun but so far I am very pleased with this phone by far .
B072N6BD9V,Nick,2,"I got this to use as cheap secondary handset. Holy cow, it's slow. Like really slow. Like really REALLY slow. It can barely open one app at a time without crashing.

The battery life is utterly terrible. For boasting about having a 4000 maH battery it sure sucks it down fast. Leaving it idle all day results in only 20% life after 12 hours. Screen time is about 1.5 hours tops.

Yeah I know it's not a flagship, but it's also not usable. What a joke."
B072N6BD9V,S Palmerston,1,"I had the R1 for a good two years, and it was fine. Not a high end phone, but it could handle browsing the web, being a phone, and playing a couple games. I bought a replacement because it was starting to fail, after a reasonable lifetime for the price. I figured the new model would perform about the same. But, it doesn't. It lacks the processing power to do literally anything without lagging, to the point where composing a text message with no other apps opened seemed to be asking too much. There was close to a second's delay per letter, which crosses the line from underwhelming to unusable.

Basically, if you're looking for a budget phone with performance proportional to it's price, you can do far better than this one."
B072N6BD9V,Kim Pham,4,"dependable phone but slow as snail, good for a back up phone, but for the price what can you expect."
B072N6BD9V,Perello,2,"I bought this item for my mother six months ago. She lives far from me. She is an older woman (almost 80) and I wanted a big and simple cell for her, BUT NEW. I am from Venezuela. I Had a very sad surprise when I visited her and I observed this cell had a lot information since 2016, and a friend who helped my mother to install aplications told me he believed I would buy a refurbishes cell .I checked and I bought NEW. Cells work well yet but.... I considered BLU was unfair. and I do not if cell starts to have problem why I have to do. Sorry I am not write well in English. I take photos to show all the memory it is used by someone else. It is incredible!!!"
B072N6BD9V,Gina Moceri,5,"Seems good for what it is. Seems good. Only used it for an hour and a half so far, but seems good. Dad helped me set it up. I experimented a bit, too. He's a computer engineer. Again, seems good.
I got it as my first touch screen phone, I'm 30. To use an app I wanted to try while walking and exercising. Good price at $30 or $40.

recharges quickly. only half hour I think for the first time:)..."
B072N6BD9V,Shannon,2,I bought this phone for my roomate for her birthday and she loved it so much. After about 3 weeks it completely stopped working. Phone store said it was gonna be 80 bucks to fix it...that's how much the phone cost almost. Right before hers stopped working I bought myself the same phone and it's on its way out already. But if you need a quick phone fix this is your best option. But don't make it your only option...like I did...
B072N6BD9V,Hayley Arthur,1,"This phone does not work. It takes forever to load everything including just plain texting. Then lags just trying to text. It's impossible to use. And I'm simple. I don't need YouTube or games. All I want is calling, texting, WeChat, and Skype. NONE of those works. I can receive a call and receive a text...but to perform the task myself is a nightmare."
B072N6BD9V,HoHo,5,"Very nice screen display, bright and clear. Comes with a clear protective soft case and a screen protector. The screen protector is not easy to put on without having some bubbles or to align it onto the screen properly. I ended up not using the screen protector. Don't expect too much speed due to 8GB of RAM and slower CPU. Everything was good, especially for the price."
B072N6BD9V,JerryC,2,"I was not going to review,but I had to note this. You get what you pay for. I was in the middle of a call and this Blue 5.2 with Android said We are going to do a Security update RIGHT NOW. No warning no options to delay or yes or no.
It hung up on my call and went into update for 15 minutes. Then rebooted like nothing every happened.

You get what you pay for. I will take some responsibility and call the support team and ask the question
Why would I Not be given any choice WhY. Yes , delay, Not right now. Later . Nothing The phone hung up and took control.

B072N6BD9V,nycDUDE,4,Bought this for my 11 yr old. Build quality is good. Screen is big and bright. Looks like a high end phone at a budget price. It's good for games and YouTube not sure about calls. Not bad for the price.
B072N6BD9V,mike,5,"my 40 year old daughter broke her phone then lost it I found this phone on amazon and called at&t and they sold us a sim card and installed it for 5 dollars my daughter thought she would have to buy another phone from them but couldn't afford one at there prices. So if you have a contract and break or loose your phone these phones may be your way out inexpensivly, thanks to at&t and amazon for saving us money again! MIKE"
B072N6BD9V,Neil,1,I bought this as an between getting a better service for an iPhone 5. I didn't think my expectations were to high but it was a very frustration experience mostly due to the fact that often you don't know if the phone knew that you had clicked on something and sometimes it would just go to sleep before it responded. Or if I had an incoming call I would first hear it buzz..... Then the ringtone would kick in......... Then the screen would come to life and if you are quick you can swipe to answer before it goes to voicemail. Ugg
B072N6BD9V,Pedrus Albert,5,The product works perfectly fine and it comes with free earphone and charger. I would strongly recommend people buy this product your not gonna regret it.
B072N6BD9V,craig,5,Well at first was happy till I tried to turn it up with metro and it did not work but amazon wonderful that they are sent me another one overnight and works great with metro service so yes very happy
B072N6BD9V,flash33,4,"Bought for my wife, wanted a duel sim card phone. I have an other Blu model that works very good."
B072N6BD9V,peter lopez,1,"This is the 4th BLU phone I buy. I bought this phone as an emergency one until my Vivo 5 gets fixed by BLU and simply put this phone does not work, it's no good. When you type a text, it takes 3-6 seconds to send, or an ""app not responding"" message appears, videos and music keeps reloading and reloading for minutes! Battery last about 4 hours. It should be advertised as a bare calls only phone. In all fairness, my old BLU Studio 5.5, Vivo 5 and my wife's 5R perform pretty well and I believe they are a bargaing! They tend to overheat, buy they deliver."
B072N6BD9V,theHoney,1,"This phone worked just long enough for the return window to expire. STAY AWAY.
I should've known..I'd first ordered it for the large screen ( I have visual deficits) in July, it had problems- I figured I'd just gotten a bad one and returned it for the same model....now the one I exchanged it for has FAILED, but now I cannot return it because the time to do so has just passed!! I feel CHEATED & DISAPPOINTED."
B072N6BD9V,Notloc,5,"I haven't been using this as a cell phone. I use it for flying a drone. I connect it to the drone remote control using an OTG cable, and then place the cell phone in airplane mode ... I don't need the phone functions, just the nice large screen. It has worked perfectly for me. Thank you BLU."
B072N6BD9V,Bryan C.,4,"The phone is cheap, and it works with a T-mobile SIM card, which are what I got it for.
It is cluttered with apps, very slow, very little on-board memory, tends to be dim, inadequate camera, small screen; which are natural byproducts of costing 1/4 a typical Android phone.
I got this instead of a flip phone because $25 for the life of the phone seemed like a reasonable marginal cost for wi-fi access and the versatility of being able to download apps. I find myself not using these functions much, probably because I would rather use any other device, but they do work.
If you use internet or data heavily, it would definitely be worth it to pay a little more for a higher quality phone."
B072N6BD9V,Kennedi Marie,2,"The seller for the phone is fine, had no hiccups in ordering nor receiving the phone. This review is to warn people not to expect much from this phone. I bought this phone as a gift and it's been nothing but problems. The screen will freeze like Androids were more likely to do 5 years ago. The phone randomly slows down and cuts off at times. It's just not great. Invest in a cheap ZTE or Motorola phone instead."
B072N6BD9V,Careem Carpenter,4,"Dual sim feature is great. I cant force to run 4g or 3g GSM or CDMA only which present a security or problem when running 2g.

Still using phone after six months. Never broke by dropping. Phone seams came a little lose and broke glass because I was rough with it trying to snap it in place. The phablet is so big it hard to position it over ear to listen to phone convo. Otherise it still functions and works quite well"
B072N6BD9V,matt,4,"This phone works great for what I intended (no sim card, only use as a Spotify player and to access the Chariot app). I bought this to use as a device when I wanted to disconnect but still wanted portable access to music. Running these two apps individually I haven't had any issues.
Only major drawback is the phone is definitely laggy compared to high end devices and what most of us are likely used to these days. But give it a little more time and it still works just fine. I've not tried running multiple apps at once on it but I would not expect that to go very well.
All in all, worth the $40 but definitely a device that feels worth about that. Certainly not more."
B072N6BD9V,Lala_BOOM,5,"Bought this as an unlocked phone to have while traveling in Ukraine. We followed the advice of someone else and updated it, and that helped. No, isn't the world's fastest phone - it's pretty slow - but it served its purpose, and for $39, it's fairly priced. After purchasing a local sim card, were able to make calls, text, and access apps such as Uber, Airbnb, Maps, etc."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,3,"I bought this phone to use at work because it is cheap and if it breaks it's no big deal. It works fine for making calls, texting and using the Voxer walkie talkie app. I downloaded the Facebook Light app and it works good for that also, That being said, some other apps I've tried to download aren't compatible and it is very slow and frustrating to surf the internet and basic games like Word With Friends are almost impossible to play because of the lag time .

It's worth the 50 bucks I paid for it, but that's about it."
B072N6BD9V,George Beridze,3,its good phone i bought it for my friend but its not same as in picture its BLU C4 not A4 but i think its a little better than A4 because it has quad core CPU and newer android 8.1 version and also silicon case was not in box i dont know why it was mentioned in description so overall its good but it will be better if description was correct
B072N6BD9V,Vincent Irkalla,1,"You're better off purchasing a phone from a second-hand store, which is what I had to do after purchasing this garbage. It's slow, it's out of date, and the call quality is terrible. Complete waste of money; I've never been more dissatisfied with a phone."
B072N6BD9V,T H.,1,This phone is straight trash I charge the phone fully charged put my SIM card in it turn the phone on and literally use the phone for about 24 hours okay the next morning I get up go outside do my work drive around phone gets low I plug the phone up close the case you know assuming that the phone is charging so maybe 20 minutes go by I grab the phone and her phone is just black so I press the power button to turn the phone on nothing happened I plug the charger in again nothing happened the phone went black and stopped working on me within 24 hours the speaker is horrible the pictures like lag while you take a picture I've never seen drag in a picture before. I purchased the phone 11-4-2018 I returned the phone on 11-5-2018. The phone is trash. Don't buy .....
B072N6BD9V,Winglessfarey,5,"This is a great, easy to use, smart phone! Even if you've never had a smart phone before, this one is for everyone! Very clear, larger key pad, UTD Android system, a very smart phone! I'm with Consumer Cellular, and it works with their system! Huge + in my book! I don't think I'll need another phone, but, if I do, I'll get another one of these!"
B072N6BD9V,geffrard,5,"Good price and the phone works properly, nothing to complain about"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,4,"The thing that I don't like is, its too smooth in the back.
The phablet works very good."
B072N6BD9V,MJ,3,"Does NOT work for T-Mobile as advertised. Not a bad phone otherwise, but returned it because I needed it for a T-Mobile line and tried every way to connect it and was not able to do it. Three T-Mobile stores tried it and when they couldn't do it, I then called T-Mobile customer care in New England & discovered that it is definitely not compatible."
B072N6BD9V,sharon brown,2,"Terrible phone. Had two in the past that were great but this one is terrible and I wish I had another option. This phone does not keep pictures. I take pictures today they are gone tomorrow. I brought a sim card for the phone it worked two days now it says it no sim card, 2nd one by the way. I opened up the picture section one day and I see a bunch of pictures from I am guessing the previous owner, mind you this is supposed to be a NEW phone. That day is the day all my pictures along with those began to disappear. Highly disappointed. First Blu phone I feel like i have been cheated on. Very upset!"
B072N6BD9V,PeterS,2,"I bought this phone to use with a SIM card in Europe. I tried the phone at home in the US with Wi-fi and it seemed to be fine. I installed the SIM card and the phone responded. But when I tried to use it the first time in Europe, it literally died. I bought a new pLG phone in Europe which I use with the same SIM card, no problems. Don't buy this phone, it is a gamble."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,"Excellent phone for the money. Comparable to much more expensive phones. The key to a good experience with this phone is using a fast SD card, 16gb or more. Using a fast SD card frees up the phones internal memory for system use and the phone works awesome. Hard to believe you can get this good of a phone for the price."
B072N6BD9V,jen,1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SISTER IN JAMAICA. UPON TAKING IT TO JAMAICA WE DISCOVERED ONE OF THE SIM CARD SLOT WAS DAMAGED SO SHE FIGURED IT WAS OK AND I DIDNT WANT TO TAKE IT BACK TO AMERICA COS SHE DIDNT HAVE ANY PHONE. LATER ON SHE DISCOVERED THAT SHE COULDNT EVEN TRANSFER ANY APPS TO HER MEMORY CARD SO SHE COULDNT DOWNLOAD APPS OR TAKE PICS. ALL THE TIME PHONE KEEPS SHOWING NO SPACE NO SPACE. HMM WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. EVENTUALLY IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. LESS THAN A YEAR? COME ON. IM SO MAD I DIDNT TAKE IT BACK AND GET MY MONEY BACK. SO DISAPPOINTED! TOO LATE TO RETURN IT SO I LOSE!!!!
B072N6BD9V,Gaby D.,1,"As much i like this phone for it size, unfortunately i have to return it.
The phone can't pick and connect to Wifi at work or at home.I tried everything i could to fix the problem without any success."
B072N6BD9V,Uncle Hyltee,5,"Ive only had it for a day, but so far this has been great. It isnt the fastest, but for 40 dollars this is amazing! You can google and call. My sim didnt fit, so i am going to verizon tomorrow but i got a free calling app that is working fine. I dropped my iphone off a rollercoaster and sixflags basically just sent me a completely disasembled phone. I got this until I can afford a new one and so far I am pleasantly surprised. So far its a great phone!"
B072N6BD9V,Vaughn,4,"Loving the battery life and the metal frame.
Display is pretty good too and I'm happy for the flash on the front camera. Rear camera is lacking thou so don't expect any great pictures. So far it functions ok with little hanging up here and there but for its price it's a deceat phone."
B072N6BD9V,Joe Public,3,"First off, this is you get what you pay for. The battery life is not what I was hoping for, I got about 90 minutes of game play and watching videos. Android system is solid, however several apps I wanted were not compatible with this device. This would make a great secondary device, just not for me."
B072N6BD9V,Sylvester,2,"There is no documentation on this device. BLU further is violating the GPL by not releasing the source code or device trees or rom files. It comes pre-installed with mtklogger.apk, a known undesirable program."
B072N6BD9V,Dk,1,"i have never written review before bt this time i cud nt stop myself, nt because its good bt because it is the worst one in my life....it stucks for no reasons n gets the not responding sign every seconds. Also it gets suddenly out of network n WiFi connections. It only increases my blood pressure.....I had hard time using it for couple of months until i get the iPhone XS. I will never recommend it for any one....really disappointing :("
B072N6BD9V,garmin user,5,I wasn't sure if my sons tracfone simple would work. All I did was take his sim card out of his old broke phone and put it in this one and made a call. So simple. Phone is also as fast as my Note 5.
B072N6BD9V,Joe,1,"I decided to finally switch away from my windows phone since they aren't selling apps for it anymore. got this phone and it works like crap! I finally got sooo frustrated with people not being able to hear me, saying I was cutting in and out or really quiet that I switched back to my old windows phone. Also it was sooooo slow even when it has no other apps open. many times I'd be unable to run any apps or even listen to my voicemails because the apps will constantly crash. I wish I could get my money back!"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,3,I got the phone on time. I fell in love with the size. After setting up the phone I found out it was a waste of my money! It only looks good but not worth a dime! The phone freezes at every turn. You spend more time unfreezing the phone than anything. I have been a fan of the BLU phones since they came out. I had a blu studio before the Advance 6 it got wet and stop working. The Advance 6 is slower than dirt! (you know dirt don't move) best phone I had was the studio XL. So i'll be getting another Blu Studio XL 2 & throw the Advance 6 in the trash!
B072N6BD9V,HappyDivaNerd,3,"I bought this phone because it's Cricket compatible and I prefer a large screen/phablet because of my eyesight. It's a nice phone for my purposes because I don't spend all of my free time on the phone. However, I had to get rid of all of their built in apps and I STILL couldn't keep all of my downloaded apps. Also, it requires charging more than I ever did with my previous Alcatel phone."
B072N6BD9V,MC,4,"Its not a phone for hard every day use, but it was perfect for what I wanted. Response time a bit slow, but still Very nice for the price"
B072N6BD9V,rosemary crockett,2,in less than a year it stopped being able to find the SD card. Thus the camera only worked if you uploaded directly to social media. The volume was always low and the sound through the headphones was barely audible. The phone is worse than a brick. Seemed Okay at the time.
B072N6BD9V,Frugal Mom,1,"I don't expect much from cheaper phones, but lasting a year is definitely one of them. Phone became slow (almost unbearably so). This phone single handedly made me want of any other Blu phone.

Spend the extra money, and buy something not ""Blu"""
B072N6BD9V,deepinvegas,4,I currently have 7 of these phones. They all do what they say they will do. The price of $60 is reasonable. One of the seven phones has a screen problem. It looks like some kind of liquid leaked inside. But it still functions well. I live in Vegas and am outside allot so these phones are subject to some extreme heat.
B072N6BD9V,Jessica Morales,4,"Nice phone. Happy with appearance. A little slow. Wonderful price. I needed dual SIM with a USA number and my Mexico number. Works Perfectly. Zero fuss. I'm not happy with Amazon or the delivery. I did get phone before Thursday as this is when it was expected. I received Sunday, and I didn't have anyone home to receive so I was worried they would leave at my doorstep in my apartment complex. And sure enough they did. Amazon is reporting they handed it to someone directly. They DID NOT! It could have been stolen!"
B072N6BD9V,Beannker1996,5,"I love my phone, its really big and the camera quality is really good, its cheap, really good phone for the price, the item is big PLUS , it comes with a phone case, a earphone and a screen protector. It has two camera, both camera has flash on it. The screen can be split into two as well. So you can ask for anything better than that"
B072N6BD9V,Edwin Sanchez,4,Good perfomance
B072N6BD9V,Noel Ingle,1,"I liked the price and smaller form factor, but too many other problems. Does 4G ok. It damaged 2 SD cards. It also won't display as a shared USB drive. Won't show up in the Windows File Explorer either. It was a bad purchase."
B072N6BD9V,Robert,3,"another cheesy phone for a cheesy phone price, volume is very low, camera sucks, I tried to ""give it a chance"" it too long, couldn't send it back, put it in the ""spare phone in case of"" box"
B072N6BD9V,Viji,2,Apps are very slow. After hitting the Dial icon it takes about 15 seconds to bring up the key pad. When answering calls after swiping the dial button the screen goes blank for about 15 seconds before the conversation can be started.
B072N6BD9V,T. Britt,4,The product arrived in a timely manner. My only disappointment thus far has been the regular memory problems I have been having and the regularly freezing of the applications. Overall it is a decent product and works well given the price.
B072N6BD9V,Calah Brown,2,"So, I got this phone because my old BLU phone did a good job. HOWEVER, That is not the case for this phone. This phone has a ton of apps that you don't need but can't delete. Three of those apps have ads that automatically open and they are so annoying to close. The only thing I can do is disable the three apps for a couple hours of relief until they enable themselves again. Also the phone is very slow and prone to freezing or crashing. I don't recommend this phone to anyone. It's pretty..but that's it. I am going to have to buy another phone so very soon."
B072N6BD9V,Karli,5,Great phone. Sent out of the country to Jamaica for use. And my grandpa loves it. Great connection. Everything works perfectly
B072N6BD9V,Carolhxx,1,I bought the phone to use when I traveled to avoid roaming charges. I couldn't make a single call. The phone kept hanging up. I downloaded one game and it kept freezing up also. Do not waste your money on this inferior product.
B072N6BD9V,Larry Wann Jr,2,"The first day this phone was fast and great but after 3 days it has slowed down way down. Some apps don't want to open the play store freezes. The op is not top quality, when you swipe it doesn't rotate back, you have to swipe back. compared to my lg g4 it feels like a old phone. Not happy at all"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,3,Got what I paid for. Downloaded a few apps and it started to freeze. Moves really slow when the battery power is low. Bought it as a temporary replacement and its doing a good job as that. You get what you pay for!!!
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,I have had nothing but trouble;e with this phone from day one but I thought it was just me. I have had this a year now and almost to the day I bought it it has given up on me. It won't charge it charges a little then discharges and will do that all day and night. The little port that you plug the charger end into the phone is loose and no way to fix it. DON'T BUY A BLU ADVANCE A4 you will be sorry.
B072N6BD9V,Susan,1,Calls drop bad reception. Plug the sims in other phone and works perfect. I do not recommend not even for a temporary relief. It is unusable when you do not have wifi. Calls last the length of 2 words if you luck maybe 3.
B072N6BD9V,Cy Korte,4,"This filled what I wanted. I purchased this to use as an MP3 and game player, not as a phone."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,I liked the BLU Advanced A6 phone when I got it and ordered 2more as gifts. It worked great at first but then we all started having the same problems with them. We were not able to hear without the phone being on speaker and it freezes and the screen starts flashing and you can't turn it off or reboot. You have to wait until it allows you to. It would be a great phone if the issues could be resolved.
B072N6BD9V,Dal V,4,I bought it for my second SIM card just to have a small tablet to use in bed or travel. Its a pretty good device. User friendly with decent space.
B072N6BD9V,Yolanda Denny,2,"This is one of the worst phones I've ever had. First it takes some serious re-programming to get the phone to read the SD card, once you get it to read the SD card (which works everywhere else) it won't store anything on it. The battery lasts about 3 hours - while its off the charger and not being used. Google takes over everything on the operating system and it takes forever for the programs to load. Maybe I just got a bad one but - wow - save your money!"
B072N6BD9V,joy,2,"la bateria dura muy poco . volumen bajo. necesito un instructivo urgente pues es complejo en cuanto al manejo de los archivos y su ubicacion (tarjeta micro o espacio interno) cuando quiero accesar a las imagenes no tengo una carpeta en el escritorio q me las muestre. .. . me quedo con el 4.0l a pesar de que su software es de renovar anualmente.
y la tarjeta sim debe recortarse ya que no cabe en la ranura"
B072N6BD9V,Jumah Dorley Frank,5,I would recommend. I bought this phone for my little sister in Africa and she love it so much. Buy it you wouldn't regret.
B072N6BD9V,Damian Rodriguez,3,"I like the phone body clear screen slick design, memory poor slow tasking phone is nice,plug switch should be at the bottom not top it freeze must of the time.can keep up with sd card and apps freez always fb live is horrible,"
B072N6BD9V,Disappointed customer,1,"Don't buy, phone freezes constantly and every app possible pops up and says not responding, even when you are not trying to use that particular app. I called and tried to see what I could do about it. Was told to wipe cache and phone shoule work....I have to do this 3 or 4 times a day and my problem still persists!!! Don't waste your money!!"
B072N6BD9V,Roselin EstephanÃ­a,4,"I've been using it for a week and it's a really good phone, althought I don't think the battery lasts much, and it charges kinda slow (in comparison to my previous phone, a Nokia Lumia). The selfie camera is good, the other one not so much, or maybe I haven't figured out the way to use it. Overall is fine, I'm happy with it, I think it's fantastic for the price. It really is unlocked and works fine with Movistar in Venezuela."
B072N6BD9V,mepenny,5,"The most important reason for me was, I have bad eye sight so i needed a big screen and its perfect. I use it mainly to watch Hulu and Netflix. Unfortunately, since its not compatible with Sprint, I'll have to wait on using for what it was intended for. But for now, its my go to when relaxing in bed. Great picture quality, great sound. Takes some really good pictures also. Wished i had more to say.. will later on tho!"
B072N6BD9V,dawn crabtree,1,"This phone is awful. The price was affordable in a pinch. However, this phone consistently restarts itself, can't seem to run apps, at least 20 times a day tells you app has stopped running. I would only recommend this phone as a starter phone.
I will say I do generally like BLU phones. They can't all be winners."
B072N6BD9V,Mayo Fingers,1,"This phone did not hold up at all. It discharges very quickly, has poor screen resolution, and crashes with any use. I bought for my son as his started phone, but he was unable to use it."
B072N6BD9V,Antonia Sifontes,5,"new phone and came really good, I have no bad thing to say only good things, the phone works perfect and the delivery was fast"
B072N6BD9V,Angel,1,"This phone was returned for not been working properly and i order another BLU.When received the other Blu phone was worth's, screen open and closed without touching it and made calls without me doing it."
B072N6BD9V,selah,5,Great phone. When u miss an drop in water it still work very well
B072N6BD9V,motorhead44,5,It is android and I had a blu studio c before and it still work fine.
B072N6BD9V,Kevin,4,I got this for my daughter for her first phone and it has survived this long I'm surprised ð the only thing I've heard her complaining about is that the internet on it is to slow.
B072N6BD9V,Mel Ryan,3,Short battery life...the sound is really low also...can't find a way to turn sound up more than I already have..have searched through the settings..cannot have very many apps..continually tells me to remove apps to get more..putting a card would help but my old phone had so much more space available.
B072N6BD9V,Kyle Nowak,1,"If you (like me) are buying this phone to use on vacation in Europe, boy are you in for a surprise. You will not receive and advance A4 that is compatible with all 4 bands of 3g. Instead you will be sent a model C4 which only picks up American bands. So now I'm in Europe with a phone that doesn't work and had made route planning and destination searching require WiFi. Really irritated that false information is being displayed on a product. This has really put a damper on my vacation."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,Not a good product overall. Bug size and clear screen but hubby hates it because so much of it's processing is taken up already that even installing basic apps like fb make it impossibly slow.
B072N6BD9V,Michael B Mann,3,"Nice looking phone; great screen, big enough to actually see. What I don't like is all the bloat ware that is factory loaded. I have tried everything I know and I still cannot stop the incessant pop-up ads. I will not buy another Blu phone."
B072N6BD9V,Jonathan C.,1,"I don't know if I got a defective item, but I got a phone with a battery drain of 5% a minute when WiFi was turned on. Yes, 5% a MINUTE it wasn't a misspell. Buy with caution, obviously wouldn't recommend."
B072N6BD9V,Lydia M.,3,I like the screen size and the camera is really good BUT it runs SLOW and I constantly have app pop up saying some of my apps that are not even open are not working. You do get 4g service but it's still lags and so does the keyboard and Facebook. This phone isn't for people who want instant results and the battery dies quickly even after not letting apps run in the background and Bluetooth sucks up the battery so if you get this phone invest in a power block with it.
B072N6BD9V,kasper,1,"Dont recommend buying this phone. Have less tgan 2 gigs of memory and even after buying a mini disk to expand the memory phone ran even slower and apps wpuod crash constantly, even when you dont open them. Phone lagged out so much would have to reset entire phone. The signal sucks no matter where you are. Phone said i had full signal with 4g but that was a lie. Even connecting to Wi-Fi didnt help it run any better. I've had better data signal in Iraq"
B072N6BD9V,Arlene Jackson,2,I tried to get this phone turn on with my number to straight talk and family mobile and they said this phone is not comparable with their service is this phone a third party phone if so what company owns this phone
B072N6BD9V,Chris,1,Seriously a waste of money. The free phone you get from a prepaid at least works for awhile but not this one. To slow to do anything. Buffered videos and music. Because it's big and and not a real good HD makes it worse. Oh I am being unfair you can text with it.
B072N6BD9V,Joel Paras,1,"Frustrations building up after 2 days. It will not follow what i want to do. Will not turn page, will not let me call, will not let me write message. I had to turn the damn phone off and turn it on again that way itll be okay. If i dont do a hard reset, I will go crazy.
I wish i had listen to jamgirl1 advice! Same issue happened to her phone and my phone!"
B072N6BD9V,R. King,1,The phone is less than 3 mos old and battery life is less than an hour on 100% charge. Extreme lag. There are times I can't read or send messages. This is second BLU phone I have had and i will never purchase another on. I recommend spending a little more money to get a quality product. It will save you money in the long run.
B072N6BD9V,Moma,1,"Junk, Spec is too low. Buttery full charged in the morning, but dies evening. I was thinking it must be freezing but it was just slow to open app, web, everything.
And can not read freedom pop sim. Speedtalk worked."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"I am very dissappointed! I
just got this phone 2 days ago and it is not charging. It is running hot and I cannot get in touch with the customer service people!
I am sending it back for a refund or replacement phone."
B072N6BD9V,Jewel,3,"It seems as though this phone sat there for quite a while before I purchased it. While it's really easy to use, the battery life is very limited. The battery drains sometimes shortly after it's been fully charged."
B072N6BD9V,Guaroa grullon,5,Would not recommend for a heavy user. But would be fine for a basic user. Gave it 5 start cause it is what it is. You cant expect to much for that much money.
B072N6BD9V,Rosario Natalia,1,"I bought this for my father for father day, since I have a blu phone also I thought he would like it. Well he didnât like it the battery wasnât charging well, plus when he played videos from YouTube he had to use earphones because without them he couldnât hear anything. Even I tried to see what was happening. Even contacted the company and didnât get a reply back."
B072N6BD9V,Eduardo,1,"I'm very disappointed with my purchase. I was looking forward to using the phone, it looked great from the description. Although...it did not work. I didn't even get to use it for 5 minutes. The phone just doesn't turn on and I've tried to charge it. I don't know if the phone is faulty or the battery is. At this point in time I would not recommend this phone. I was planning on getting another phone at least so I could have a back up. I don't see this happening any time soon."
B072N6BD9V,max tanzen,5,I bought this as a cheap second phone. It definitely exceeds my expectation. Great little phone
B072N6BD9V,Lbatch,4,Itâs a cheap phone. I thought I was ordering another but got this one. It serves its pourpose but wonât be having onto this for long. Cheap cheap quality.
B072N6BD9V,nan,5,"Very nice phone - clear pictures- sound was ok, but i'm a little deft - so added a sound app- i can hear the phone
across the room -I watched a movie and the voice was very clear. no buds needed. The information loaded
is easy to understand. I would recommend this to any one"
B072N6BD9V,fernando r. domingo jr,4,"Build quaity is good and for the price,you canât go wrong.its also pretty quick of pulling out web page and playing games and that is because of no unnecessary apps and bloatware....i will buy this again and surely recommend to friends who are looking for a phone that is not expensive but does what it does as a phone....."
B072N6BD9V,Sabrina,1,"This phone is junk, have had problems with it from day one. First of all its always having to b shut off and restarted just to get anything done on it such as text messages or a phone call, second it keeps up with these stupid things popping up that I'm not even trying to use, it says, ""system UI isn't responding"" or ten other things and how they aren't responding, ""blu help isn't responding"" ""messages isn't responding"" ""contacts isn't responding"" and it keeps going....."
B072N6BD9V,Kelly Murray,2,"The processer is ridiculously slow. There is a constant pop-up saying different apps aren't working. It is only useful for videos. Using this phone for Facebook is beyond frustrating. It uses a larger simcard, so you have to go to your phone providers store to get the right size card. Also this phone is only one G. It does take one memory card and two simcards, not two spaces for more memory."
B072N6BD9V,Gluggernaut,2,This phone has a terrible battery life and is not intuitive. The volume when listening to incoming messages or talking to people is very low so it is difficult to have a conversation.
B072N6BD9V,washie,1,"Got this for my 7 year old daughter for her to use what app via our home network (not as a phone), she gave it back to me after about two weeks. This phone is badâ¦very slowâ¦almost useless. Work great as an alarm clock."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"It is advertised as 3g 4g pbone , it is a 2g phone that cant be used with att prepaid sim cards the ohone is useless, i will ask to return it and get a refund! Very disappointing product"
B072N6BD9V,Victoria V.,1,This phone absolutely sucks the battery life is a joke the phone does not work well I bought for my daughter's birthday and she is now very disappointed that the phone is so horrible I wasted money on this purchase we would not recommend this phone to anyone I now have to buy a different phone completely horrible phone
B072N6BD9V,TRC,1,"Freezes up all the time, no matter what I did, even before I installed anything on it the apps that came with it would freeze up. Sent back for a refund, customer service for BLU gets more stars than the product."
B072N6BD9V,Hilal Kesim,5,I got this phone to test out apps Iâm developing and I am impressed with how functional it is despite the low price. Takes a full few seconds for some apps to open or to click on things. Not sure what else one could expect though.
B072N6BD9V,Roszebud,3,"I bought this phone for my grandson. Pro:
Beautiful large screen. Con: unable to download games and apps. This is where the problem is. He was not able to download several games sd well as the Amazon audible app. He also complained about short battery life. My return date passed,so I have to keep it. It will be a backup phone. If you just need a large screen phone this is perfect. Plus it is only 3G. It's disappointing that you can't find troubleshooting information online."
B072N6BD9V,Sandra Douglas,5,Love it cause now my granddaughters can play their games on it and other things like take pictures. It's really worth the money
B072N6BD9V,vibora45,3,I bought this phone so I can use it overseas. I charged it before I left and turned it off before I travel. When I got to my destination the phone was dead. The battery did not hold the charge. I had to plug it into an outlet to use it. During my stay overseas I was only able to use it a few times because the battery did not hold the charge. I still give it a 3 rating because of the no hazzle return policy.
B072N6BD9V,sharon,5,Just what he wanted
B072N6BD9V,ERIC B,1,"This phone is,super slow. Apps don't respond some times. Face cracked within minutes of use. Just complete garbage. Can't hate this phone more."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,4,Just bought this for my son to watch his cartoons on. Kind of hard to get internet on an android phone. It always says authentication error.
B072N6BD9V,Stanford Shapley,1,"The phone was slow and the battery drained unusually fast.I would like a replacement of a better phone. Will keep you posted on how Amazon handles this problem.
."
B072N6BD9V,Joni Isham,1,The BLU unlocked cellphone can't work. I needed a phone that had a battery that could let me use it longer. What I didn't know was I needed accsessories like a sim card and be compatible with my service. Well I had no idea that these were needed as I was not informed of this. I called for help and the rep. that I talled to didn't help me at all. Don't I feel dumb!!!!!
B072N6BD9V,adel rida,5,"good price ,good budget work excellent in us and over sea"
B072N6BD9V,Oscar MÃ©ndez,5,"Already the teams were received in the country where they were sent, they work perfectly, there is no problem with them"

B072N6BD9V,Daniel Miranda,1,"Las aplicaciones se ejecutan de manera muy lenta. Las llamadas no se realizan con fluidez ya que muchas veces no se tiene volumen. En cuanto al hardware, la baterÃ­a demora una eternidad en cargar incluso con su propio cargador y tiende a recalentarse (tambiÃ©n me pasÃ³ con otro modelo de la misma marca). Definitivamente no solo NO recomiendo comprar este modelo, sino que les aconsejarÃ­a buscar otra marca."

B072N6BD9V,Joana Castaneda,1,"I just bought this Blue 5.2 smartphone, and I simply took it out of the case and tried to turn it on, but it does not turn on.
It is very desapointing. Not only because of the money, but mainly for the waste of time. I am leaving on a trip soon, and I though I could take this cell overseas, but, it just don't work.
Does this phone need a sim card to turn on?
I will return this crap."

B072N6BD9V,Parag M,1,I bought BLU Advance A6 and have a very bad experience with device as well with customer service. This device display wrong time (randomly) on top right corner. It's very frustrating for a customer to have such faulty device which display wrong data with bad performance. I would recommend not to buy this phone.
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,It is nearly impossible to scroll. The main reason I bought it is because it has a HOTSPOT but I can seldom to get it to come on. Can't believe it is legal to sell something like this.
B072N6BD9V,heather,4,so i got this phone today and i must say that i do love it but the only draw backs are the volume is not very loud at its fullest and the phone itself is slow. other than that it really is a nice phone for the cost
B072N6BD9V,Brownie,1,I ordered this phone to use while traveling. Phone will not hold a charge. Turns off as soon as you turn it on. And will not stay on even while charger is plugged in. If I could skip giving it any stars I would. RETURNING ASAP

B072N6BD9V,Leomar Jose CedeÃ±o Rodriguez,5,"ESTE ES UN PRODUCTO DE EXCELENTE CALIDAD, ME GUSTO MUCHO QUE VIENE CON FLASH FRONTAL, AYUDA MUCHO A TOMAR SELFIES..Y ESTE VENDEDOR ES RECOMENDADO"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,3,It's ok for the price Little slow but not bad my only real complaint is the time always changes zones even when manually set to my time zone it never will show correct time and will switch back and forth to different times. So that part is anoying but if just looking for a cheap big screen to streem movies on works great.
B072N6BD9V,ZZZAPATO,1,"The BLU PHONE won't hold a charge... won't allow contact s...awful....!

Super slow, freezes often, unresponsive apps, alarms didn't go off half the time, battery would discharge even while plugged in, to name some of the issues."
B072N6BD9V,Money doesn't grow on trees,1,Soon as I got this phone out of the box and set up it continually kept updating and shutting off. After doing it for a good 6 times I just didn't turn back on. Was able to return for a replacement so hopefully this one is in working conditions.

B072N6BD9V,M. A.,5,Great phone. Easy to set up and easy to use. Nice and large. comparable to phones that cost 10times the price. Highly recommend
B072N6BD9V,Alicia Nicole,1,"Extremely slow processing, horrible camera quality. Not happy with this phone at all"
B072N6BD9V,Kathy Martin,2,Serves its purpose if all you need to do is talk and text. Apps freeze up constantly then shuts down! Even with a memory card on or off WiFi apps will not work.
B072N6BD9V,Professor E. Knight,1,"Almost four years ago (November 14, 2014 to be precise) I posted a review about my BLU STUDIO 5.5 D630u phone, to which I gave a 5 star rating.

Although my old phone is still working perfectly well, I decided to buy this new BLU A6 for two reasons.

First, because my old Studio 5.5 works on Android 4.2 and BLU refuses to let people upgrade their OS. This BLU A6 works with Android 7, which is supposed to be better. Please note that the latest version in June 2018 is Android 8, BUT the phones running that OS 8 do NOT have a removable battery.

And, indeed, the main reason why I bought this BLU A6 was because this is one of the few new phones with a REMOVABLE BATTERY and I wanted to have one before this feature disappears forever. A fixed battery on a device kills the sale for me because I refuse to pay mucho, mucho money for a technician to replace the battery, which has to be replaced periodicallyâ¦ Unless you buy a new phone every six months, which I donât!

UNFORTUNATELY, this new BLU A6 has several drawbacks and I had to return it for an immediate full refund from Amazon, which is always great, as usual:

1) My old Studio 5.5 from 2014 has a LED that blinks red when the battery is low, and then it turns to solid red while charging and logically becomes green when the battery is fully charged.

BUT THIS NEW A6 DOES NOT HAVE THAT BATTERY LED, which is surprising.

French author LA BRUYERE wrote in the seventeenth century that âCommon sense is the most widely spread thing in the worldâ. HE WAS WRONG!

2) When I open the BLUETOOTH on my old Studio 5.5 from 2014, I read a message saying that my phone is only visible to paired devices.

BUT THIS NEW A6 WARNS ME THAT IT IS VISIBLE TO ALL BT DEVICES NEARBY! And, indeed, when I turned the BT on, I saw a dozen devices without name, only with a series of numbers.

It is very embarrassing to know that your phone can be seen by anybody around without being paired!

LA BRUYERE was wrong againâ¦

3) Finally, (and this is the reason that pushed me to rush this thing back into its box and request an RMA from Amazon), unlike my old Studio 5.5 from 2014, THIS NEW A6 HAS NO OTG possibility!

As I explained in my extensive and comprehensive review of November 2014, the OTG (On The Go) is a cable with a micro USB male on one end and a female normal USB at the other end, where you can hook either a USB external drive, a memory card via adapter (SD, micro SD, etc.) or a USB keyboard, etc., etc.

I have several USB drives of 128 Gigs each (I said GIGS, not megs!) that I connect to my old Studio 5.5 and extend the memory ad infinitum. These USB drives are filled with videos or music, leaving the internal micro SD (of 128 Gigs also) for other files.

Well, THAT EXTERNAL MEMORY EXTESION IS IMPOSSIBLE ON THIS NEW A6 because it did NOT recognize any of my memory cards or drives via none of the 5 OTG cables that I tried to connect to it!

This LACK OF OTG CAPABILITY killed the sale and I decided to return the phone immediately because, if I could accept the SLOW phone and the SHORT battery life, I cannot accept the lack of OTG on any device that I buy.

There again, LA BRUYERE WAS WRONG!

How can there be such a lack of COMMON SENSE in 2018?"
B072N6BD9V,Freddy J. Chirinos,5,"Great quality for the great price.
Works fine"
B072N6BD9V,Frank J. Sousa,1,"Would not boot up even after trying to reset. VERY poor instruction manual, I had to go to the net to find out how to insert the battery and SIM card. I sent it back for a refund."
B072N6BD9V,Nia Petit,5,Got it for a friend it has been working with no issues. Will buy this again and try to use the same vendor.

B072N6BD9V,Sue,5,My daughter 9 years old enjoy this little phone
B072N6BD9V,Joyce Ileen Smith,2,This is the emergency phone. It's small and the data does not work. I thought I'd be able to tough it out until my phone is fixed but I can't. It's cheap in price but expect to get what you pay for.
B072N6BD9V,Shawn,1,"Not compatible with 4G LTE. Crap reception. Compared to a basic Android, on the same carrier, it barely established a data connection, Full bars on the other Android. I returned it. Don't bother. CRAP."
B072N6BD9V,Keda,5,Got this for my dad he Loves it and the screen is big so he can see everything clearly. He talk about it so much I had to get a second one for my Uncle too.
B072N6BD9V,Gadgetgirl,5,Bought the phone for a family member. Really nice screen so now she wants Netflix. Recommend this very budget phone for people who surf and watch movies but don't load a lot of apps.
B072N6BD9V,J Moore,1,This is the worst phone I have ever experienced in my life. The battery sucks. The operating system is slow and constantly crashes programs.

It is a durable phone and it doesn't crack or break easily. It better than paying for a 300.00 phone that will break like glass. Overall it's a nice size durable phone."
B072N6BD9V,Ashley,1,"Worst phone ever. I got it for metro PCS. It got in the network but it would never run on 4G, only the E I guess that's 2G. Me and metro tried e different time in a month to get it fixed. I spent about 120 on a phone and accessories that I can't even use now. And I guess I didn't make the deadline to return it either......"

B072N6BD9V,Duncan,4,This BLU Phones are really good my previous 5.0 inch was great until a weight bar fell on it. I thought this was s downgrade but it's a great phone with better features.

B072N6BD9V,misty rankin,1,This phone is terrible it laggs you cannot put apps on it and expect it to function proper. It does a factory reset without warning. Pics are not good quality and the phone doesnt last long. I haven't had this phone but a little over a month.

B072N6BD9V,Elisa,4,The only problem I have with the phone itself is that almost all of my apps don't respond and pop ups can be annoying at times. My network coverage is terrible where I live and this phone doesn't make calls over WiFi. So you'll have to have an app for it.

B072N6BD9V,Daniel K. Gondwe,5,Perfect and the 4G here works perfectly and it is working on perfectly. The size is not burdensome.
B072N6BD9V,Aldrin Salazar,4,"Fairly slow, but expected at this price range. it comes with a screen protector and a silicon case. The perfect inexpensive phone."
B072N6BD9V,EricaMarie,1,"Very disappointed. Phone did not work properly, kept receiving message ""app not responding"", the phone would shut off when plugged in to charge and to top it all off its actually another phone with covered up fake labels. If I wanted that phone I would've purchased it. Scam. I will NEVER recommend or purchase from this company again. Only cool thing was it came with case and screen protector. I'm still without a phone and I thought I was getting a hell of a deal, boy was I wrong."

B072N6BD9V,misty rankin,1,This phone is terrible it laggs you cannot put apps on it and expect it to function proper. It does a factory reset without warning. Pics are not good quality and the phone doesnt last long. I haven't had this phone but a little over a month.
B072N6BD9V,Medardo Cabello,3,El telÃ©fono es bastante lento para abrir las aplicaciones pero no se puede pedir mucho por costo.
B072N6BD9V,Jesus Garcia,5,excelente. recomendado
B072N6BD9V,Elisa,4,The only problem I have with the phone itself is that almost all of my apps don't respond and pop ups can be annoying at times. My network coverage is terrible where I live and this phone doesn't make calls over WiFi. So you'll have to have an app for it.

B072N6BD9V,Sandra H.,5,"There is nothing I like most and nothing I like least,Blu Studio phones are the best on the market."
B072N6BD9V,ahquin family,1,"out of all the BLU phones I've read from other comments, the a7 had the very least so I decided to give it a go. when I got it, some areas of the screen was unresponsive so I couldn't open the things that I wanted. when others talk about the phones speaker, they were right! this speaker was turned up all the way and I couldn't hear anything! it actually sounded like the speaker was about to blow out. I love the phone device and the 7 inch screen, but as the famous cliche goes: ""you get what you pay for""
hopefully BLU can keep their prices the same and upgrade their devices soon."
B072N6BD9V,dailey,1,"This phone is junk. Spend a little more and buy something else. The company would not offer a refund, just wanted to replace with same model. No thanks"

B072N6BD9V,Charles,1,Phone does not hold charge. When plugged in it doesn't even charge. Completely useless.

B072N6BD9V,John,2,"Bought this to use as an MP3 player for Spotify. The phone constantly crashes and everything is slow to load and laggy. I can't review this as a phone, but it's a barely adequate app platform."

B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,Good phone
B072N6BD9V,Tyler,4,The screen protector is glass and hard to take off I broke the area where the Audio comes out of and now need new one
B072N6BD9V,James,1,Dislike because it too small i send it back to u all on 2/19/19 where is my refund
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"First impressions, it's good for what I'm using it for. I like using old phones as mini tablets and my old tablet/phone broke. I love my current phone, a Studio XL2. This A6 had almost the exact the same dimensions but it's lighter weight. It's also a little laggy by comparison and the battery life isn't great. I fully charged it this morning and tossed it in my purse. Half hour later it was down to 93% and I hadn't even used it yet. Bluetooth, location and wifi were off. Storage sucks too but I added a 32gb SD card so no problem there. Can't figure out how to move apps from internal storage to SD card yet, so there's that too.

For my needs, as a tablet so I don't run down my main phone battery streaming music and playing games, it's a keeper. If I was using it as my main phone, I would've sent it back. As a cheap tablet, I'm good with this.

Update 10/11/18
Reducing from 3 stars to 1. Don't waste your money. Doesn't have enough memory for more than 1 or 2 apps and then they don't function properly. I bought this to use as a tablet and it worked well for a while. Would NEVER use for a phone. Now I can't open Pandora or Spotify without an error message. It constantly tells me it can't recognize the storage, even with apps stored on the device. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app is the only way to get it working again. Sorry I spent money on this. Blu sucks at returning support messages. I'll never buy Blu again."
B072N6BD9V,monica vales-melendez,5,"this is a nice phone it's my third one, the others i've replaced because i have broken them or drowned them, other wise for what i use a hone for it's perfect."

B072N6BD9V,Lisa Ceschan,1,"This phone is horrible. It didn't get a good signal, sent text messages late if we were able to send them at all. I do not recomend."
B072N6BD9V,Shari Hinkel,5,"This is my 1st smart phone and I'm really impressed. I'm sure the big brands phones do a lot more, but for beginners like me, this phone is perfect."

B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,This phone is been charging for d past 2 days and is yet to actually power on not good at all I need my money back
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,"THIS PHONE LAGS AND PHONE SYSTEM ALWAYS HAS "" NOT RESPONDING "" MESSAGE. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND."
B072N6BD9V,Jeffery,3,"There's a lack of detail in the description for this phone. Unlike its predecessor, the Advance 5.0, which had two SIM slots AND a micro-SD card slot, this model, the Advance 5.2 gives you an option -- you can either use a nano-SIM (ONLY), and a micro-SD card for storage, OR you can use two nano-SIM cards, with no extra storage. The base storage in the phone itself is only 8GB. The selling points for this phone would seem to imply that that you could have two SIM cards (the size is NOT specified) and an additional 64GB micro-SD card for external storage. Not the case. For an unlocked phone, it would have been nice to have space for the mini-SIM, which is the legacy most people want to port to another phone. So, note: nano-SIMs only; only one SIM if using extra storage."
B072N6BD9V,Esther Igu,5,Amazing! Came with screen protector and case. Amazing value for the asking price

B072N6BD9V,carlos,1,"This phone is astonishingly slow. Right out of the box, before any updates or app installs, it was unusable. I had to wait on average 10 seconds just to open the settings.

Download speeds reminded of the good old times, when we used 56k modems. Seriously? Why does it take so long to download a 26MB app on my super mega blaster fast WiFi?

I was very disappointed by the fact that it does not have a gyroscope. Because of that I cannot use cardboard or any VR apps.

The worst offender however were the annoying BLU adds. Unlike Prime Exclusive phones, this was not in the phone description."

B072N6BD9V,satyanam,1,"This was rubbish
The slot for the SD card was too big and misshapen, not sure if it was a used unit or just came off the model badly.
I spent over and hour on the phone with Amazon Shanna and Blu Ella who asked the same questions over and over.
Most of the time I was on hold.
I decided to charge the unit, which apparently has 3 hrs of battery time.
More a waste of time and money.
Send this back, but wish amazon would have been of more help

Slowest phone ever"

B072N6BD9V,John A. Davis,2,"Bought this strictly for a cheap audiobook player and that's what it is. This is the slowest device to do anything with, in the way of setup and general use. The device takes quite a while to start and the interphase is dead slow. Have not used it as a phone so can't inject anything there. The device does seem to work very well as an MP3 player and connects to Bluetooth well but still slow to respond to any input. The description says it has Android 7 but it is actually Android 6."

B072N6BD9V,HCastro,2,"Okay I know this didn't have a 4 or 5 star rating but i thought would make a good phone for my 8 year old. Not a good idea,. She couldn't play that many games cause it wouldn't load due to being very slow, the camera is horrible (I had a 5 mega pixel that took 100 times better then this so I dont believe this is that level) . Another thing is the screen would constantly randomly flicker, not sure what that is all about. Updates take forever also, with that aside, I can't even recommend this to someone that just wants a phone too answer calls cause the sound is very low even when turned all the way up. I submitted a return and going to just fork over the extra money to get her something that she will enjoy."

B072N6BD9V,Joshua Dauzat,1,Ph.is junk comes on but never loads stays on screen never boots up RECON.
B072N6BD9V,Jocelyn Everett,1,"I had a really good experience with my last BLU phone so I didn't think twice about ordering a newer model. But this one is terrible. I've only had it for 4 months and it's been so awful that I'm already looking for something else to replace it. Here are the highlights:

1. Lack of phone storage: I don't know why they decided to decrease the phone storage so much from the BLU R1 HD (16 GB), but it's so bad you guys. It doesn't take very many apps to fill it up, and I think that being so close to maxed out storage is what's causing some of the other problems. There's no way to move the apps to the external storage (I have a 64 GB memory card in the phone that's barely got a dent in it from music & photos.)

2. Apps freeze up or stop working CONSTANTLY. For the first couple of months, I got constant pop ups telling me that ""messages"" weren't working or some other app that should be working all the time on a PHONE. It didn't even matter if I was trying to use them or not. They interrupted calls, emailing, etc. Stupid. I Googled around and found a setting on the phone that would stop apps from running in the background, and that resolved this issue, BUT...

3. Now I'm not getting text messages at all. Or sometimes I get them and sometimes I don't. Or sometimes I get other people's messages but they don't get my responses.

4. Oh yeah - and being on a phone call causes the phone to freeze. Let me repeat that: Being on a phone call causes the phone to freeze.

I just can't with this phone."

B072N6BD9V,TLC615,2,"I really wanted to like this product and to be able to say this was money well spent. But the truth of the matter is that I've become more and more frustrated as time goes on. The phone is extremely slow. It's very glitchy and perhaps the most frustrating thing of all is my apps just stop working at random. It doesn't matter if I'm currently using a particular app at the time or not. All throughout the day I get sporadic messages that this app or that app has closed or isn't responding, in other words has crashed. My Amazon app won't even open. I've had to reinstall it several times. Needless to say I am not a Happy Camper. On the plus side, I will say it's an attractive phone to look at. It doesn't appear to be inexpensive. I just wished I could say the same for the overall functionality of the phone. B.t.w. the battery life is extremely poor as well."

B072N6BD9V,Heather D,2,"Very slow phone speed. Even though it's 3G rated it will not make a phone call, send a text, or show your location unless you're on wifi which makes it less useful than my 4G tablet! Really only an emergency only phone in my opinion. We were going to use it a few months and then upgrade but it's so slow and has such a bad signal that we went ahead and got a better phone right away. Its only saving quality is it has surprisingly nice menus and it's easy to find your way around it."

B072N6BD9V,John R,5,Great budget phone. It does the work
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,4,"One of the reason why I bought this phone, I read the reviews and most people wrote about the case and screen protector that comes with the phone, but sadly I did not received those in my box. All I got was the phone and the charger. I wasn't gonna say anything, I also don;t promote negative but I was disappointed. However, I need to buy another phone because it fell twice and crock both sides, it's still function. I feel that if I had gotten the rubber case with this purchase it would have serve a bit longer.
I purchase a Blu before and had to buy the the case and screen protector, because I didn't see where those accessories came with it neither did I read where any reviewer mention that they got these item with their order.
Overall, it's a nice Phone, my husband loves big phones and he really like this one, but it's damage now. The seller delivered the item about 2-3 day which was pretty fast. The phone has most if not all the updated features. Would I purchase from this seller again? Yes."
B072N6BD9V,Kimberly,1,It's was really slow. Apps wouldn't respond.
B072N6BD9V,Kindle Customer. Steve's kindle fire,5,"First prime cell phone user,I like it very much.No complaints."
B072N6BD9V,Barb H.,3,"For my hubby, based exclusively on lite-weight-ness. Described as 3.2 oz;, it actually weighs 5.6 oz. Big disappointment!
Also, said to be dual-network capable... only if you don't want to put in a memory chip. It's only got 2 chip-slots, and most will want to put in a sim-card and a memory card. If you install two sims you won't have any place tor memory, and the phone only has 8 Mb of memory.
Oh, and be mindful that it's only GSM-capable, not CDMA, so half of the possible networks are excluded including Sprint,Verizon,and US Cellular.
There went 2 of the 5 stars I would have given it, because it's really a great phone, especially at this price. We didn't fret about switching to ATT or T-Mobile, we used a Tracfone sim-card for ATT and it works just fine. ***** except for the misrepresentation and misleading description."

B072N6BD9V,Jas,2,"A great screen which was my primary motivation for buying it. However... it is a little buggy. It gives me out of storage space messages a lot when trying to update apps. Sometimes if I reboot it works sometimes not. All in all, it is disapointing. When it works it works great. My second Blu phone. The first was the Blu Life. Seriously considering moving back to it until I can find something else. Maybe I got a lemon but maybe not. It was an impulse buy from an advertisement and I am suffering for not doing better due diligence before the purchase. I would be cautious on this model."

B072N6BD9V,Kaspars,3,The phone is very slow!
B072N6BD9V,MudCamper,2,"It's really inexpensive. So I knew going it it wouldn't be that great. It's really really SLOW. The screen technology looks like it's from the 1990's. The viewing angle is about 5 degrees. But I'm fine with all that. It's only 39 bucks.

But the problem is it's glitchy. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes my texts arrive, sometimes they don't. Sometimes it disconnects from WiFi (and doesn't let me know) and when I try to reconnect, it fails unless I reboot the phone. This is all completely unacceptable. I would return it if I hadn't already thrown the box away.

(And full disclosure, I own other BLU products and like them.)"

B072N6BD9V,ali,5,a good cell phone
B072N6BD9V,MadMan,1,It says it works with AT&T and it didn't. I bought it and tried to connect to my current service and was told it was incompatible.
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,"It doesn't stay charged! It does everything your old phone does, but I thought it was upgraded, however... IT'S THE SAME CHARGER... it just doesn't fit at all... it wiggles, and if it is slightly off, it doesn't charge at all. So, I thought, well, it's the NEW phone & charger, but same phone charger, fits 100% old phone and it just stinks, so it barely charges, unless you happen to have it EXACTLY sitting in the perfect position for over 6 hours. Then it charges... 70%... but don't move it - don't try to use it, just understand- the charger cord some what fits the charger input & you are just supposed to accept this. Pure trash."
B072N6BD9V,Gregg,2,"I like the size & price . I dont like how it drop calls & i cant go onto my internet @ home , the alphabet isnt so simple like SamSung ."

B072N6BD9V,Alissa C. Lenzinger,2,"For me it's way too big, also it doesn't seem to charge very quickly not hold a charge for long and im not constantly on my phone like most people. Also, I feel the speaker isn't very good, it's hard for me to hear people on phone calls and for them to hear me as well. I've tried it for a week and right now I'd rather use my old cracked phone. Great price, but unfortunately I'll be returning it."
B072N6BD9V,Ihor,1,Bed phone
B072N6BD9V,TattedPanda,1,"So I have used BLU phones in the past and Ive always been happy with what i got. But........this phone is crap, I get it its 40bucks. The ear speaker sucks, i have to use headphones when I'm on the phone or I cant hear the other person. The phone is slow but i knew what i was getting. The battery life is bad, I start my day at 6am and at 1pm died. I don't have any extra apps running in the background and i normally listen to music all day.

I give this phone 1star because the fact the phone features don't even work well enough too just use the phone by itself."
B072N6BD9V,narciso galaura,4,Easy to use and affordable
B072N6BD9V,Sandra Mcnichols,5,"To small, but doing the job."
B072N6BD9V,Gerson,2,"It is a good option only if you go to have only Whatsapp there, because the phone is slow, something that BLU should have to change in other phones of low price, because I think that if you want like a company give a good tool for their users, you should make better the relation between the processor with the software."
B072N6BD9V,robert giammanco,5,All items are awesome
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,Loved it and works great
B072N6BD9V,Lady Tee,1,"This cell phone is the worst!!! the wireless connectivity is very slow, the internal space is very limited because the device recommends several additional apps to be downloaded with the app, so the space is taken up alone by them. And....the network connectivity is very...very...slow.
I am a PC Tech. Don't waste your money!!!"
B072N6BD9V,joshua,5,"don't listen to these idiots and there reviews

B072N6BD9V,Veronica Villasenor,5,fast
B072N6BD9V,Angel Subero,5,Excelent!
B072N6BD9V,William Curry,3,Good phone for the price but just don't hold charge unless you keep WiFi and data turned off unless you are using it drains battery fast but at least this model BLU you can replace the battery. So that is a plus.
B072N6BD9V,Johanna Coronel,4,Good
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,I previously checked the reviews of this phone which is what helped me make the decision on the purchase...I have had this phone for the last 15 days and have had nothing but trouble!!! It does not hold a charge. I have deleted all apps and inserted an SD card and it is STILL saying no memory!!! Maybe its just MY phone but it is awful!!! There must be a ghost or something in my phone because it dials numbers and keys are pressed while it is being held in my hand. Absolute worse phone i have EVER had
B072N6BD9V,Michel Rendon,5,"Only tested for one day, it is a gift for some else, it is big, beautiful, it already comes with a case and a screen protector - 5 starts for that. I would prefer loud speakers by the size of the phone, that would be the only thing I didnt like."
B072N6BD9V,Amanda,2,"I wanted to love this phone. It's tiny and cute, with a screen perfectly sized for both use and convenient to carry. But it lags and locks up if you try to run more than one app at a time. I can't run Google Maps to GPS myself to my destination and also listen to my audiobook. It's one or the other. The camera is TERRIBLE too. I'm really sorry I bought it, despite the very low price. I guess you get what you pay for!"
B072N6BD9V,Sweet Tea,1,"This would be a perfect phone if I could hear. I like the size, it's ability to connect to data (phone or wifi) It does everything a much more expensive smart phone does but the sound on phone calls is horrible. I am hearing impaired but even with the hearing aid assist, I still cannot hear and neither can my husband who can hear a pin drop in the next room. I would give this one a pass and I wish I had."
B072N6BD9V,candy,2,"MODEL IS A6
A PRETTY PHONE THAT DOESN'T RUN
I ONLY RECOMMEND IF YOU DO TEXTING ONLY maybe check a few pages thats it
dissapointing

UPDATE THIS PHONE IS FREEZING UP
NO APPS WORK
maps no totally frozen

1gb ram? that should be usable"
B072N6BD9V,Angel DeJesus,1,"I got a little less than I expected. I purchased the device for international travel and as a device if lost would not be a great financial ne personal hit. It's a decent Android device but it's lethargic in its usage. Very slow even when using either mobile data or Wifi. It is so slow just downloading any app. If you need speed, I highly recommend not buying this as a primary option. The battery life is seriously abysmal and I strongly recommend that you should have the charger with you at all times.
I only advise anyone who purchases this device to really understand you get what you pay for."
B072N6BD9V,Semora hunter,1,This is not a good phone. It's very slow and the picture quality is awful! I thought if I bought a memory card that would help with the speed but to no avail. Also each time you unlock the phone there's an ad. I am not at all pleased and am returning for a better brand phone which is double the price of the Blu studio I bought. I read the reviews which prompted me to buy this phone. Some of the other reviews are very misleading. The battery life is quite poor. If you only talk then yes it's good for that.
B072N6BD9V,Kirstie Coleman,1,"I thought it would be safe to buy this phone because it was only being sold on Amazon, but it is literally the worst phone i've ever had!! Not only was it impossible to charge under any circumstances - new cord, new wall cube, etc. I also haven't used anything this unresponsive since dial up. I can think of NO time this would be a decent phone for anyone and I can't wait to send it back..."
B072N6BD9V,ThomB,3,"It is not bad but don't expect a miracle. If you just need a phone this one is very good. Don't expect a miracle phone but it does work well with calling, texts and, general use. This phone would be great for a first time phone user, kids, who you just want to have a way to communicate with them. It would also work well for grandparents or older folks. Hell, if you just want a phone, this one will work."
B072N6BD9V,Mr. Rumsfeld,1,"Pure Trash. I wish I had received one of the good ones everyone else is reviewing. This thing has a battery that will die within four hours of idle time with no use. Screen is incredibly delayed - sometimes totally unresponsive. Cell signal went from 4 bars with the R1 to 2 bars, outside only, with this, and I can't use it in my house where I could easily with the R1. Camera is trash. R1 was a vastly superior camera. I owned two of them. Worst thing about the phone: I CAN'T HEAR IT. I literally have to jam this thing as far into my ear as possible to hear anything. It is truly terrible, and I usually never return things but I used this for a few days and immediately spent the extra $20 for the Advance 5.2. Hopefully that has the quality that this lacks. Very disappointing that they would even sell this."
B072N6BD9V,Margaret Anderson,4,Seems to be a rebranding of the grand energy. Android version 6.0. Kernal 3.18.19. Side loading sim and micro sd. Four stars because I expected headphones which were on the picture but not included. Comes with a clear rubber back protector but no screen protector. Using 32gb sandisk ultra sdhc uhs-i class 10 it reads it. Haven't received sim from h20 yet...will update if it works.
B072N6BD9V,Vessuvius,2,"I fully charged the phone when I got it and it died in about an hour, its extremely extremely slow, you need a sd card for it to actually do anything, and the camera isn't good. I got this as a temporary phone for a few weeks before I buy a new iPhone but idk if I can even put up w this piece of crap for a few weeks. I can't even express how slow it is. I've had it for like 3hrs and it's already crashed like 20times and died twice. The only thing good about it is that it's big and cheap. I'm going back to my 5 year old cracked phone.ðªð"
B072N6BD9V,J K,1,"Terribly slow web browsing, slow response for typing. Battery held a charge well for the first 3-4 weeks then rapidly lost the ability to hold a charge. Return window is 30 days so if they keep selling this piece of trash, skip it. Good as a simple camera for a child. Also works for my 11 yr old as an mp3 player. Otherwise, it's garbage."
B072N6BD9V,Purplefreak,4,I bought this to use in Belize when I visit a few times each year. It works good.
B072N6BD9V,Rochelle I. Pratt,1,"don't buy this cell, its slow !! (without a lot of down loads) trying to make a call is almost impossible. When the ring comes through, your not able answer cause the screen stay black for a about a minute, the turn off button is on the side, located were you hold the phone and can easily disconnect the call while talking. IT ISN'T WORTH IT !! AND YOUR NOT ABLE TO INSURE THE PHONE THREW YOUR CARRIER CAUSE, IT ISN'T PURCHASED WITH THE THIER COMPANY. hope this helps I HATE THIS PHONE"
B072N6BD9V,E. HEWITT,1,"THIS WAS THE WORST PHONE EVER! FIRST DAY I GOT THE PHONE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH ME BEING ABLE TO HEAR THE CALLER. TURNING UP THE VOLUME WAS USELESS. HAD TO TALK ON SPEAKER PHONE FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN HEAR ME AND THEN THE VOLUME WAS STILL LOW. THERE ARE GLITCHES WITH THIS PHONE. TEXTING IS DELAYED. GETTING ON INTERNET IS DELAYED. KEEPS SAYING ""THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH CONNECTION."" TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE I TRANSFERRED PICTURES FROM MY OLD RAGGEDY PHONE TO THIS RAGGEDY ONE AND MAY LOSE PICTURES/INFO BECAUSE MY OLD PHONE IS ONLY WORTHY FOR A TRASH CAN. ANOTHER THING I ORDERED THE TEMPERED GLASS TO GO ON THIS PHONE AND THE PHONE IS WORTHLESS. YOU WILL TRULY BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU GET THIS PHONE. SENDIING BACK FOR A REFUND!!!"
B072N6BD9V,E. G.,1,"I don't know what the Blu Advance A4 is but it is not a phone. The incoming phone volume is barely audible rendering the phone useless. This is my second A4 with the same problem. I managed to contact Blu's Tech Support but they were no help suggesting I upgrade the firmware, which I did, but there was no improvement. I spent some time on the 'net trying various software 'fixes' for Android phones with low phone volume but none worked. I also installed several volume boost apps, again with no effect. The speakerphone worked well however and callers on the other end of the line could hear me well enough. My advice is to save yourself time and frustration and stay away from this 'phone'."
B072N6BD9V,D,1,"This is a terrible product, I really tried to like it. It came with a defective charger, unusable microphone and speakers. this is really a terrible product, I will be staying away from BLU in general. this is way below any expectations, which where already low based on the price."
B072N6BD9V,Nina Butenko,2,"Easy to use, but I am a little disappointed with overall quality. Had a BLU phone before that was in the same price range that was levels better. Very poor ear speaker level makes it almost unusable if you are not using Bluetooth or headphones.
I do not know if I would recommend this phone other than for an occasional use."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"i got the phone and it was great,it seemed at first.but i got it late at night so i didnt use it yet,well first day the battery didnt last long,and i cant get on any apps as it closes and phone turns off.i really regret buying the phone.wish i now how to return for a phone that works"
B072N6BD9V,jasmine prasil,1,"This phone is not a quality phone. It does not keep up with today's demands of a smart phone. 1. Poor battery life. The battery life last on average a few hours a day with normal use. Do not try to use the phone while charging because it will drain quickly and shut off. 2. The software is not compatible with today's applications. Todays applications require a large use of space and processing which the phone can not keep up with and freezes or crashes with using a simple Uber App or Google Maps. So I had to remove all apps and only use this phone to text/call. 3. Even if you keep it to simple calling and texting only the phone simply crashes and freezes. Just to note: I have NO apps downloaded anymore because the phone. 4. The calls do not come through clearly. On numerous occasions people tell me the phone is muffled, they can't hear me, static, etc. I have to stand very still and do not move just to talk to many people. I wasted my money on a cheap phone that gives exactly a cheap phone results. I definitely recommend staying away from BLU technology and products all together. There's a reason they are not known in today's American cell phone market."
B072N6BD9V,C.L.,2,"Just bought this phone but am returning it right away. Within 45 minutes of setting it up, it became very hot. I checked the battery but it wasn't as hot as the phone. Even after turning it off for several minutes and cooling down, it became just as hot. There wasn't anything running in particular. I hadn't even activated the new cell service or had the chance to do much with it and yet it was alarmingly hot. Hopefully this was just an anomaly, but I won't be taking my chances with a replacement.

Otherwise, it would have been nice: lightweight, nice screen display, and it came with a clear phone case and screen protector."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"Second time I purchased this phone in the past 8 months and they both broke within the first month. First one there was something wrong with the battery , would just shot off and not restart the phone. Second one the screen was going black everytime the phone ring. Do not recomend."
B072N6BD9V,ZAID,4,Good small phone works good..
B072N6BD9V,Stacy Incontro,1,the only thing positive about this phone is.... well NOTHING!!! have to reboot by shutting down and taking out battery. doesnt reconnect to wifi as it should. force closes messages multiple times a day. im so done with this blu. and ive owned nothing but blu phones for the last 6 years. this is the only one ive had that i dont like.
B072N6BD9V,Dazednconfused,3,"It works and thereâs nothing hugely wrong, the only actual issue I would mention is that the speaker doesnât work very well unless the enhancement option is on and even then, itâs not the best. This was just an extra phone until I can replace my iPhone, so it serves its purpose."
B072N6BD9V,Abay,1,"My mom is tech savvy for her age and sheâs picky about cellphones & she loves her new phone. Then a week later, it wouldnât hold a charge, it would over heat, the screen would freeze, you couldnât see whoâs calling, it kept shutting down and restarting. Refund requested."
B072N6BD9V,J. S. Harvey,1,"i'm disappointed it is NOT!! a SMARTPHONE as they claim or T-moble no nothing about BLU phones. in the discription it said phone capability with ""SIM"" slot,with phone icon press blue phone dial # pop-up but T-mobile say it's NOT a phone only a wifi tablet."
B072N6BD9V,kelly newton,2,"Im so embarrassed I bought this as a gift and the phone doesnt always get texts,the phone goes off days later and gets like 20 texts from one person that was sent days ago,most of the time u cant see whos calling and cant answer it shes had this phone a few weeks not worth it at all!!! It causes more problems than anything"
B072N6BD9V,G,2,"Doesn't support 5GHz wifi. How difficult is that to implement in a phone. The 2.4GHz is old. I hate this phone and you will, too. It's slow. They have hijacked Android and made it worse. I have an older BLU phone and love it but this one stinks."
B072N6BD9V,George Bonhag,5,nice phone
B072N6BD9V,Janos Gereben,1,"Opening the phone to insert the battery is a stupid struggle, breaking nails and prompting swearing off the product forever. I checked online video and advice and still ended up defeated (and with a broken nail!), returning the phone."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,Good quality/price
B072N6BD9V,Camille Henry,1,"Dont waste your money buying this phone. Itâs completely slow, phone comes with a lot of apps u canât delete"
B072N6BD9V,Carlos Godoy,5,Is a Good Ã­tem
B072N6BD9V,Sir Lawrence,2,"If you need an emergency phone or one as a back up. For the price, this phone will do the trick. After a day or two of transferring all my stuff from my previous phone. I almost instantly reget it. I have seen congress and turtles move faster than this device.
The size is good and the dual sim card is great. That is the main reason I got it. But This thing is way too slow for daily needs of an avid phone user."
B072N6BD9V,L. MODHA,3,"Good for the money, But it looses memorized Wi-Fi. Do not connect well with Wi-Fi. May have issue with antenna."
B072N6BD9V,Eduardo Lopez,1,"If I could give this phone zero stars, I would. The description says it is Dual SIM but it is not actually. Also, the user manual is confusing and incomplete, and useless. There is no way I can see how much storage capacity the phone has. Besides, it does not detect SD Cards. A huge disappointment in spite of the good looks... DO NOT BUY IT

This stupid phone does not store anything since its actual storage capacity is 6Gb including RAM... All important work files never really stored in the phone. THIS PHONE IS AN ABSOLUTE FRAUD!"
B072N6BD9V,Just M.E.,5,Easy to change ur current cricket phone by switching sim card. You will need a Nano SIM card. And micro 65 Sd card that is high speed. I am enjoying it and learning as I go .
B072N6BD9V,Dorothy Silva,1,"This.is.a.totally.useless.cell,hone.It.is.difficult,to use.and more, difficult, to understand. Mine never.worked. I called.Blu, Customer service four,times to get.hel. in making the hone.work and their customer, service is not.good. at. all. It.was.one. roblem after another with this hone. and I haven't been able to use it since I first, bought it in. December 2018. It won,t even go on now and I feel like I have wasted my money o it and Amazon will not take it back."
B072N6BD9V,Lisa Bla,1,"Awkwardly big, my kids keep teasing ""where is your tablet, I mean phone"" Does not get good service with my carrier T-Mobile This style does not link to the ASPN number, although other BLU devices do. Because of this the phone is very unreliable, frequently only allowing emergency calls and causing the network to not be available."
B072N6BD9V,Tamika Russell,5,Got it for my daughter to use when she does sleepovers.
B072N6BD9V,shaun nelson,5,"BLU Advance A4 -Unlocked Dual Sim Smartphone.Make a Awesome Gift for my kids. Great quality product, great on time delivery definitely a go to company for our essential oil"
B072N6BD9V,SharBear,3,"So, I didn't buy this phone for myself. Bought it for my brother. So the only thing I can say is for the price it was a good buy as it came it charger and screen protector and a silicone case which was awesome bcuz I didn't have to then buy one. Not one of those rugged protector types, but it provides some protection from the damage he's going to wreak on the phone."
B072N6BD9V,Tammy Davis,1,Worse phone I have ever had. All the apps & the phones system would constantly shut down. Hardly could answer phone calls. Would highly advise from getting this phone. My husband bought one at the same time I did just a different model of Blu. And it worked just as bad didn't use them more than a month and ordered LG's
B072N6BD9V,Shaw,3,wifi signal disappeared sometimes. Have to restart the phone to regain wifi
B072N6BD9V,Dennis McMurtrey,1,"I had a Blu Studio 7 II, it worked with Net10. But this BLU A6will not work with any SIMM card that gets put in it. Verizon no contract, Net10, At&t no contract bring your own phone services.I have lost $90.00+ because I kept trying to use different SIMM cards and now it's past the return date. Not happy."
B072N6BD9V,Robert Warren,3,"overall runs slow and the sound is pretty low. But you get what you pay for and the main thing is its a clean phone that works, it was unlocked, started right up after I inserted the sim card and worked."
B072N6BD9V,Sylvain Hayes,1,"This item requires two SIM cards. One to operate the phone, the other to operate the tablet functions. Each sim has a fee one for the phone the other for the tablet this is if you are a t-mobile customer. To make things even worse the phone doesnâ come with any features that you would expect...why? Because it is a tablet the features are all there. Are you willing to pay for two separate services?"
B072N6BD9V,adina bell,1,"Poor internet ..... battery didn't last long....just is not a product I will buy again

B072N6BD9V,nick,1,"The processor just can't keep up anything, even with no aftermarket apps. Call quality is mediocre, the camera is low-quality (as expected), but most importantly, it would delay giving me notifications until hours after they should have been delivered. Also, the battery won't even last a day, even if I barely have it on."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"This phone is not worth anything. Our son had a $15 pay as you go economy phone that works way better than this. It takes a long time to turn on, if at all. Once it turns on it shuts off randomly even when your on a call. It says 3G/4G but it is not a 4G LTE. Even the 4G by itself does not work it drops to 3G. It is not worth buying at all!"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,"The volume while in a call is very low.Adjust it all the way up,still very low.Add an app to increase the volume,no difference.I tried several different apps.."
B072N6BD9V,Kayy,1,"Please, do not waste your money on this phone. It sucks so bad. I haven't even had this for an whole year and its horrible. The phone overheats like crazy. The sound is low. Camera quality sucks. Phone shuts off and restarts out of no where. Just don't buy it."
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,Liked the unlocked dual sim capability as well as case and screen protector that came with it. This is a good phone when travelling. Sound on phone is just OK. Ram is a bit too low and battery drains fast when you are on gps or the web. Recommend higher Ram and better sound for future versions and adding a headset.
B072N6BD9V,Android fan,1,I bought this phone so my daughter would stop playing with mine. But every. Single. App. Is slow. I'm talking 1st generation android phone slow.
B072N6BD9V,Sherry L. Brookshire,1,I think the BLU 6 sucks. I will be returning it as soon as I can purchase a better phone. All that I read is a terrible phone. It will only stay charged for 2 hours. I had a BLU 5 and it was a great phone. All I can say you get what you pay for and this phone needs to taken off the market. From what I have learned today. It is NOT a secure phone.
B072N6BD9V,LORNA MCRAE GLANVILLE,5,"Great phone, at a great price. I am thinking to get another."
B072N6BD9V,jvinIA,3,Love the size and it works well for voice and text. It hurts for memory which makes it slow for me. I unloaded some apps and got Uber working but it's still sluggish. Battery life not to good. Can't get through a whole day
B072N6BD9V,Amber,1,Product was affordable but I will not be ordering this phone again the phone freezed up a lot when I got it at system problems and drain the battery a lot but you can't expect much when you by phone for $65
B072N6BD9V,Dennis Stevenson,3,It's a nice phone but runs really slow
B072N6BD9V,Anudeep Reddy,1,"don't buy it. useless device. doesn't work at all. extremely slow, you'll have to wait forever for a click / swipe action to materialize. if you are in the market for a smart phone this is not the one you should be looking at. if you are in the market for a regular phone & thinking eh.. why not this? I'd still say no, because it is neither a regular phone that responds quickly nor a smart phone that performs well."
B072N6BD9V,Rachel Rosenberg,1,The cell phone is way to small battery power sucks I wich I never got this cell phone its not worth the money
B072N6BD9V,James Sawyer,1,Would have been nice if they mentioned that it requires a larger sim card. Lost my normal one and you can't open the back to retrieve it.
B072N6BD9V,PUI-MING CHAN,2,"There is no manual to explain how each of the functions can be performed. The sound is too small and speaker function has to be used. Keyboard is too small and is over-sensitive. As a result, you mistype most of the time and can't ener the right information."
B072N6BD9V,A.T.,1,"THE INITIAL PHONE WAS DEFECTIVE AND USED, BATTERY DIDN'T LAST LONG, NO TRAY FOR THE DUAL SIM CARDS, SD CARD, A7 NEVER APPEARED ON THE SCREEN, NO FCC REGULATIONS BOOKLET, A SMALL BLACK CIRCLE/STICKER ON THE BOX/PHONE. CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL IS EXTREMELY POOR, INCLUDING SUPERVISORS: NO KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTS, ACCESSORIES.
I HADE TO REORDER THE DEFECTIVE, USED PHONE
GRADE: F

I AFFIRM!"
B072N6BD9V,alexx,1,The phone NEVER worked! And I brought it to the Argentine as a gift! The BLU people do not answer my e-mails. What am I supposed to do?https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072N6BD9V/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
B072N6BD9V,Marco Govea,1,"es muy lento, y la baretia no dura ni 2 horas de carga, vino daÃ±ada creo yo. Por favor reemplazarme la bateria. Gracias."
B072N6BD9V,Belinda Reardon,1,"!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!
Never have I ever had the trouble I am having with this model of BLU phone.
I wish I could send it back but I am stuck with it.
!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!"
B072N6BD9V,andy george,1,"they said this was a new phone but its used, and the connection power cord do not fit it have a short.
I am going to return it."
B072N6BD9V,Shelene,1,Too slow. Cracked screen easily. Horrible phone. Will be purchasing a different phone. A.S.A.P.
B072N6BD9V,Trinket Hunter,3,"it works fine,good choice for a low price phone, The only problem i have noticed is the battery's duration is very poor."
B072N6BD9V,OGD_Tom,2,"It works well. But it has little storage space, doesnt allow apps to be installed on the SD Card, and is sloooowwww."
B072N6BD9V,Crown,1,Don't even waste your time. Rubix cube is easier to figure out. After 2 -3 days of trying to open this phone i gave up and sent it right back.
B072N6BD9V,C. Conley,3,"You get what you pay for. I was hoping to use it to play PokemonGo, put it is just too slow. It is a very inexpensive phone it seems to work fine. Fairly short battery life."
B072N6BD9V,doaj,1,It sucks. I like the slide appearance but I can barely download any app. It can barely function at a 3g much less a 4g. There is not even enough space for 10 apps. You have to delete additional apps so that the apps you have can udate. I wish I can return it but the return window is already past. I regret buying this phone.
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,It freezing u can blearly do things on it without it freeze an when freeze is for a long time
B072N6BD9V,Erica N. Anderton,1,"seriously it literally has malware built into the system UI. If you use this your data will be compromised. I wiped my phone and I am currently trying to figure out how to replace the OS with a clean one. Or rather I am waiting for a ""security update"" that will probably just install more malware to finish so I can go back to trying to replace the OS."
B072N6BD9V,Jason Coslow,1,For the price you get what you get - texting was not even usable just way to slow.
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"A complete dud. The phone was delivered without a bubble wrap.
The phone does not even turn on."
B072N6BD9V,Nat H.,4,The phone storage is good. However the phone responds slow. It's hard to find an appropriate protective case for it. Overall the phone features meet my expectations
B072N6BD9V,missy,1,Speaker sounds blown and there is little white dots in right corner of phone not happy at all this is a pic of the phone
B072N6BD9V,Edgardo R.,3,"i like the product but I dont think Iam buying nothing from amazon ,I live in in a apartment building and the driver always leave my stuff outside
like he he is trowing newspapers a few times somebody else took my stuff so sorry amazon ,I will move to target or walmart the drivers leave my orders in the office of the building ,if Iam not home."
B072N6BD9V,lazaro menjivar,2,The audio it's too low i am having a hard time listen what the people said [audio its all the way up] everything else its fine
B072N6BD9V,Sergio C.,1,"not to buy, low earpiece volume and poor visibility display"
B072N6BD9V,charlotte hooper,3,"The screen is definitely big enough, but will only work with certain carriers. Which was unexpected, but easy enough to deal with"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,I purchased two of these phones for my nephews. Unfortunately the battery is awful making the phone unreliable. I wouldn't recommend it
B072N6BD9V,William B.,2,"Very slow processor that consumes a lot of battery power. Charging port is on the top of the phone which places strain on the charging cable whole using the device.
Otherwise, the device is lightweight, great display, large screen and decent sound for the price"
B072N6BD9V,anthony,1,"It does not work..
I just bought it for my father that he is in Venezuela, once he tried it, It did not work .. thete is some problem with the screen and now I cannot get it back because the phone is in venezuela right now... first time that happends something like this to me.."
B072N6BD9V,Samantha,1,dont bother purchasing. kept freezing. horrible phone.
B072N6BD9V,R H Johnson,1,Please do not buy this item. This phone simply is not worth i.
B072N6BD9V,Tammyt,1,"Total crap! It drops phone numbers from contacts. It gets bombarded by sites you never visited. Constant advertising. It is extremely slow, for everything!"
B072N6BD9V,Mommy Rene,5,Great cell and my husband loves the size
B072N6BD9V,Melveyne Scudder,1,"The BLU Advance A6 is EXTREMELY SLOW...
DO NOT WAIST TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK...Why is Amazon even selling this phone??? People who gave this phone a good review apparently have no clue what a SMARTPHONE is supposed to do. WARNING: THIS PHONE WILL COST YOU TIME AND MONEY, JUST DON'T... NEGATIVE 5 *****"
B072N6BD9V,curtis tod,2,bloat ware slow running very basic
B072N6BD9V,Shopper,4,Affordable and the price is reasonable
B072N6BD9V,Riteway Appliance,5,Nice phone VERY good coustomer support.
B072N6BD9V,Adam,1,This thing is slower than death. Just going to messages takes forever. It over heats and the battery dies extremely quick. Takes forever and a day to charge. Too bad I cant return it.
B072N6BD9V,Lori,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE UNLESS YOU HAVE ALOT OF FREE TIME! It takes FOREVER for anything to work on this phone and to top it off, I can't return. It was ""past my return window"". So do not waste your money. Amazon should remove this from their offerings."
B072N6BD9V,SatyaRaj,1,The display is not working on this new phone as i opened the seal..Didnot expect this at all. It was very embarrassing and terribly dissapointed with the service and the piece.
B072N6BD9V,LUIS DANIEL HERNANDEZ,5,"good product, no problems"
B072N6BD9V,Tessy,5,Good phone!
B072N6BD9V,Fa-Q,1,Returned as rubbish.
B072N6BD9V,Customer,2,loses charge immediately after unplugged and completely dies after 2 hours
B072N6BD9V,Jessica Ray Ellis,2,It was a great starter phone for my daughter. It lasted 2 months and stopped working. It's everything she needed. I guess you get what you pay for.
B072N6BD9V,Adela M.,3,It's an ok product for the price. Bought for my 10 year old son as he does not need a super expensive phone. It does get kind of glitchy at times.
B072N6BD9V,kiran,3,its good phone with big screen
B072N6BD9V,Kandy,1,Would not recommend.

B072N6BD9V,Smile,2,Super slow
B072N6BD9V,Benard,3,"What I like the most about this phone is that it is good in news updates. What I hate the most is that the battery like is short, you have to charge every night, also, there is this pop up always coming showing that one app is either downloading or stopping"
B072N6BD9V,Marina Calderon,1,horrible. a fire hazard. please be advise it will explode
B072N6BD9V,Michael McLawhon,1,"Battery life is not very good. 2 weeks old and now it won't take a charge. I bought this for an employee in need, to use for work. But he cant because it lags so bad that he cant move from webpage to webpage to clock into jobs. This phone isn't worth $40."
B072N6BD9V,jeff,1,I will never buy a Blu again. I only had it one month when it refused to hook up to my Wi-Fi. Then the day after that it completely locked me out. It just says Blu bold like us and has locked me out. I can't return it because my info is in it.
B072N6BD9V,S. A. Davis,2,Lags and apps crash frequently making it impossible to use. Returning.
B072N6BD9V,Patricia Fondo,3,It was a gift for some one no problem as yet.
B072N6BD9V,Andrew Squires,1,"Not compatible with carriers and audio is poor.
Not a very strong process power either, turns off after either using YouTube or chrome"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,Awesome!!!
B072N6BD9V,Carissa Hynes,1,This phone is the absolute worse. Does not work at all. Just wasted $70 for a paper weight. Never ordering again. Sad time

B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,This phone is terrible!
B072N6BD9V,rafael lasala,5,Bueno
B072N6BD9V,Skyler,1,This phone sucks when you run out of a memory it slows down so bad to where you take the battery out every 2 seconds
B072N6BD9V,Client d'Amazon,3,not speed
B072N6BD9V,Mike,1,I just got this phone first off it wouldn't read sim and no instructions on how far to insert sim then after 10 min the phone just went blank and would not power back on safe to say I'm sending this back asap
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,I have had 2 previous Blu phones and loved them. This one however has issues. Phone volume not very loud and all apps including Google will shutdown suddenly and you have to restart the app
B072N6BD9V,JayTee,1,"This phone only takes nanosims. This is not mentioned in the online description. It does not come with a manual, and none is currently available online. Battery cannot be accessed or replaced. I have returned it, never to but Blu phones again."
B072N6BD9V,Nana Ntim,5,perfect
B072N6BD9V,Ralphos,1,"This is a crappy little cellphone. As soon as I unboxed it, it started to freezes and stopping working so I have to re-start it constantly even with no apps installed! Very bad choice for a cheap cellphone

NEW REVIEW:
I haven't be able to use the phone. Touchscreen is unresponsive almost all the time. Tried with factory reset like 20 times and still not working. DO NOT BUY THIS CELLPHONE."
B072N6BD9V,Bart e.,1,"This is the slowest phone on the planet. Turn the phone sideways and there is approximately a 30 second wait until you see the screen again. If you switch from one app to another, it will usually timeout before you get there."
B072N6BD9V,socrates,1,"using it just a reader now since calls are not clear, bad voice and reception in addition it is slow connecting to the internet"
B072N6BD9V,erjon murataj,2,"Well ,is not good responder. Cheap. It feels like i am 10 yrs behind.."

Worst, could not purchase a protective Case,....the glass cracks very easily .. a metal back dosn't help at all"
B072N6BD9V,Ndioba Niang,1,"Please do not buy this phone. I bought this phone as an extra phone just in case my Samsung Notes dies on me since I use it for work. But this phone has really bad picture quality, some of the picture settings are experimental, and the battery drains so fast even thought I hardly use it."
B072N6BD9V,Joe,1,"I rely on my phone's GPS, but it is unstable for this phone. Two major issues have arrived trying to use google maps:
1.) The GPS app is extremely slow. It takes 8 minutes to load and quits tracking sometimes because the phone can't handle it.
2.) The GPS app drains the battery very quickly. With my phone on the car charger, my phone died within in an hour."
B072N6BD9V,Tia,5,My son loves it
B072N6BD9V,Tammy Pingle,2,"I read reviews before buying this phone. It was nice that came with earbuds and case. The phone it's self is ok, but slow. It freezes up. I purchased microsd but when I installed it, it didn't work properly"
B072N6BD9V,John M.,3,Like the size but speakers are not great and Internet loads very slow.
B072N6BD9V,Bizi,3,Lag is terrible on this phone. You get what you pay for really. Can't play videos without freezing. Probably only suitable for people texting or calling only
B072N6BD9V,Michelle P,1,Very disappointed with this product five months ago I purchase this item for my dad and my two nephew and the phone stop working. I have reached out to the seller but yet to get on answer from anyone. ð¡

B072N6BD9V,Neijaiah,1,"Product description didn't goes as planned. The phone didn't hold a charge. Apps kept saying not responding. Other than that, the size was perfect."
B072N6BD9V,Kelly L Bolvin,2,"The phone as alot of issues, there is to tech support ..... Biggest issue, the ALARM does not work correctly ... if the alarm goes off its 2-5 mins late"

B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,4,nice wide screen
B072N6BD9V,Janel Clarke,1,You get what you pay for.1. The phone doesn't hold a charge. 2. It takes HOURS to charge. Not BLU's best.3. The apps do not work well on this phone. And I have had a Blu in the past.
B072N6BD9V,Stacy LVC,4,"This is the second Blu I bought my 15 year old daughter in a year. I am so happy that they sell for this price and reasonably thrilled about the features that come in them at this price. It's definitely not a top-of-the-line every Bell and whistle phone but it's a smart phone it does everything normal smartphone does. Definitely does everything my 15 year old needs it to do. it's got a front and rear camera both are pretty decent and both have a flash, it gives you access to all social media apps, games, internet browser and she can get on her school website to do her online classes. For around $60 is a nice good sized phone. I know what I forked over for my phone so definitely impressed"
B072N6BD9V,marsha parkinson,1,This phone takes so long to response its the slowest phone i ever use couldnt recommend noone to buy a sloppy product

B072N6BD9V,ERIC,5,Good
B072N6BD9V,Maria Fatima De Andrade,2,"I imagine for the price the quality of the Smart phone, I should not complain, but the model is completely sealed and the use of a nano SIM card makes it more complex un these latitud"

B072N6BD9V,Sir Lawrence,2,"If you need an emergency phone or one as a back up. For the price, this phone will do the trick. After a day or two of transferring all my stuff from my previous phone. I almost instantly reget it. I have seen congress and turtles move faster than this device.
The size is good and the dual sim card is great. That is the main reason I got it. But This thing is way too slow for daily needs of an avid phone user."
B072N6BD9V,L. MODHA,3,"Good for the money, But it looses memorized Wi-Fi. Do not connect well with Wi-Fi. May have issue with antenna."
B072N6BD9V,Eduardo Lopez,1,"If I could give this phone zero stars, I would. The description says it is Dual SIM but it is not actually. Also, the user manual is confusing and incomplete, and useless. There is no way I can see how much storage capacity the phone has. Besides, it does not detect SD Cards. A huge disappointment in spite of the good looks... DO NOT BUY IT

This stupid phone does not store anything since its actual storage capacity is 6Gb including RAM... All important work files never really stored in the phone. THIS PHONE IS AN ABSOLUTE FRAUD!"
B072N6BD9V,Just M.E.,5,Easy to change ur current cricket phone by switching sim card. You will need a Nano SIM card. And micro 65 Sd card that is high speed. I am enjoying it and learning as I go .

B072N6BD9V,MachineShopJoe,1,"I can't review about the features, performance, camera, signal, or storage space on this phone. It failed the most basic necessity: powering up. It wouldnt turn on out of the box, and it never detected the charge cable. I've had a Blu phone before. This was the second and final Blu Phone I will ever purchase. If you need a spare or budget phone, just pay a little extra and try something that will actually turn on."
B072N6BD9V,Rhombus Ticks,1,"I bought this phone purely as a repository for cryptocurrency so my regular phone wouldn't get hacked. I had no expectations other than a wireless connection. I CAN'T GET THE DAMN THING OPEN. What good does it do me if I can't get the battery inside to charge it?

Considering returning this to Amazon and its the first product ever I would do so with."

B072N6BD9V,W. Twain,3,"I got this as an iPod like device. I wanted something for podcasts, audio books, etc.
This lags, itâs slow to load things. It doesnât connect to Bluetooth easily, and even has trouble with my WiFi once in awhile. Itâs not my phone, otherwise Iâd buy another. Since I only use this for podcasts, as long as a reboot solves the problems Iâll continue to use this.
3 stars because itâs so cheap."
B072N6BD9V,yup123,1,"If you want to throw away $60.00 this is the product for you. Stopped fully functioning 32days after purchase. Tried factory resetting now won't setup up and is unusable. Love this phone, going to store now to buy one that works"
B072N6BD9V,Stanislav,1,"Very slow phone ! I bought it for work android studio ! Donât buy this phone ! Better will be advance 5 , in this point !"
B072N6BD9V,tina thole,1,I won't even give it a star rating these phones are the most sorriest phones I've ever had they mess up they are so slow I don't believe I will be buying another Blu product in the future I should of stayed with lg or zte or samsung
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,"Got my blue6 May 11 2018, I had a blue5for about 4 years want to upgrade big mistake. The 6 close down at 1.15pm each day no matter how long I charge it, some day it just will not recharge I have it recharging since Monday and it is showing 1 percent charge I spoke to a blue representative who told me to try another charger then call her and tell her the result this make sense to me I have been using the charger it came with the try and charge it for2 months. This phone is the biggest carp I have ever buy and by the way an Amazon representative hand over to the blue representative"
B072N6BD9V,Ray Dupire,3,Phine and ereader together great ideabut battery not long between charges and phone volume very low with no way to increase
B072N6BD9V,BajraktareviÄ,1,"The slowest most aggravating painful to use phone I have ever owned, and this is including non-smartphones! The only reason I got it was as an emergency replacement for my Motorola G4 which I dropped one too many times (that was a super tough phone, just didn't have $150 to replace it), and I regret it EVERY day I use this thing! Not at all a good choice as your sole phone, it has to be a spare phone for 911 calls only or something. Whatever you are thinking, just don't buy it, you will end up needing to get a real phone shortly. I have missed interview calls and all sorts of calls because the lag between when I click to answer and when the phone actually does it makes the call over before I start. On top of that I have Google Voice and on any other phone when I answer calls from numbers that aren't saved, it identifies the person by whatever they said when Google Voice asked them to identify themselves... this stupid phone calls them all ""Unknown Caller"" even though I don't actually receive Unknown or private calls because I block those from within Google Voice. What is the point of a smart phone if it is so DUMB? This phone should not be sold for more than $10. Waste of my money by far."
B072N6BD9V,Kimberly A. Francis,2,"The phone had problems and would not work so we ordered the BLU Advance A-5 and after trials and tribulations, he is ok with it."
B072N6BD9V,optiontoheal,3,Its Ok. rather slow. good for phone calls and messages but don't expect to play any games and even messaging is a bit slow
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,2,"I gave this phone 2 stars because 3 stars, in my opinion, means its ""okay."" The problem is, for a phone to be consider ""okay"" or above, it has to have decent cell service. I couldn't tell you if this phone has that or not because even though it says that its unlocked, it didn't s. upport ANY of the network providers I went to. For a cell phone that's a pretty big deal. Because I can't actually use it for its intended purpose (You know: Calling people, sending texts, basic stuff,) i'm stuck with a good looking $60 paperweight. To be fair though it does run decently enough given the price, and customer service seemed nice enough. If you are going to get this phone please MAKE SURE that it will support your cell service provider. I personally am strongly considering returning this to Amazon and seeing if I can get a refund. And that reminds me, the lady I spoke with from BLU's customer service team let me know that they don't even do refunds themselves so tread carefully people."
B072N6BD9V,paul robinson,2,have not even turned it on yet...had it for bout a month now
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,This phone really sucks super slow returning it it's a 3G network phone no good

B072N6BD9V,tasia,2,"Calls are not clear, persons on the other end can barely hear me.Charger charges my phone very slow. Takes 71/2 hour to get a full battery as long as I don't use my phone at all."
B072N6BD9V,Juanita,2,the phone did not work
B072N6BD9V,Devin W,1,"Awful! I couldn't remove the cover with a blunt object or my finger nail in order to install the lithium battery. It simply impossible. I ruined the screen in the attempt. I know this phone was cheap, but $40 is a lot of money to use for something you can't even use."
B072N6BD9V,Guillermo Zagala,3,Good phone but too slow
B072N6BD9V,Nathan C. Ha,1,The phone says it's unlocked I bought it used in like new condition. When I got the phone it said it was on att it didn't read my sim card. I even put the Sim card in the second slot to try that. I had got this as a gift for someone. Even tho it let me enter in a new apn I was not able to get the Sim card to work. In general this phone is small and a little slow to start up. The newer phones of this model are better I hopped this was more like that.
B072N6BD9V,Desmond,4,I looks amazing !!
B072N6BD9V,Teneisa Murray,1,This item didn't work. The SIM processor wouldn't read the SIM card and showed a warning. The Camera and audio was also faulty.

B072N6BD9V,PAUL HALLIWELL,1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHABLET IT IS GARBAGE THE HOME BUTTON DOES NOT TAKE YOU BACK TO YOUR MAIN SCREEN IT USES KITKAT WHICH GIVES YOU NO OPTIONS THE VIDEO CARD WHEN YOU PLAY YOUR VIDS ITZ LIKE A STROBE LIGHT BLU DID NOT TEST OR CARE ABOUT THIS PHONE AND AMAZON SHUD PULL IT FROM THE WEBSTIE AGAIN DO NOT BUY IT
B072N6BD9V,sevenet,1,They not working
B072N6BD9V,Mary Priebe,2,Bought this for my Dad and he did not understand the phone; although my Dad is not used to Smartphones or internet.
B072N6BD9V,Dawn,1,"Good for price. But has no independent galary, everything goes directly to Google photos storage which I don't like. It apart from this, it has great features. I resold and bought another brand"
B072N6BD9V,Nadeesha B,1,I just got this phone delivered today and the camera is upside down plus I don't see the option to switch from selfie camera. I'm going back to Jamaica on Thursday so I can't even send it back for a refund to reorder cause it won't come on time.
B072N6BD9V,Ladeidra Jenkins,1,No I don't like it
B072N6BD9V,Amy,1,Not what I wanted
B072N6BD9V,EZ,1,No good
B072N6BD9V,J. Banks,1,"I bought this phone because it was the cheapest phone I could get Prime Now in an hour after my daily driver phone died. This phone does make calls, and does that well. It texts most of the time, but the message app crashes fairly frequently. For instance if you get an email and a text around the same time the phone can't handle it, and will lock up and crash the message app. Apps open slow, and touch is about as responsive as a phone on Android Froyo. Swipe keyboard is present but basically unusable. I mean for the record this thing is getting me through until my RMA replacement comes in a couple days, but don't even consider it for a daily driver. There are so many better things for just a bit more money."
B072N6BD9V,Ni,3,I only use this phone as an emergency phone until my real phone arrives. It's a nightmare if you compare it to a better name brand phone. The buttons on the side takes the phone in safe mode or some other mode and I have to figure out how to get it back to regular phone mode. Everything works if you use it with Android compatible smart watches. The battery dies really fast. But for the price I'm not upset and I am getting by with it. It does come in handy when my top quality phone isn't available so I do keep this spare phone in a safe place and with a phone case on it and all. But I'm gonna give it 4 stars due to keep accidentally pressing the side buttons. I wish they were in a different spot.
B072N6BD9V,Mark C.,1,"I was looking for a cheap unlocked phone for international travel.

This product made an appeal because of its size which fits your pocket and small bags.

However, the processor is so slow that you might see yourself leaving the country that you visited and still waiting for apps like Google Maps and Chrome to work.

At best, it could be used as a decoy phone, just in case your iPhone or Samsung S8 is in great danger of being snatched/stolen while walking on the street.

I got what I paid for...and less."
B072N6BD9V,responsible buyer,1,"Blu blows. I have one take days, literally to MAYBE charge battery.
Naturally problem commenced just after 6 mo returnable window.
Apparently it's a very common problem. Blu batteries blow chow.
Never. Ever. Again."
B072N6BD9V,FluffytheNewt,1,"I got this phone for $40. It started out just being slow. Then after ONE week, it stopped holding a charge, and even when on the charger for ohurs it would say 1% battery and die immediately. TERRIBLE PHONE! Worst I've ever had. You'd have better lick with a flip phone compared to this piece of garbage."
B072N6BD9V,Kenneth C Kovar,1,"The phones processor is ridiculously underpowered but it still manages to have marginal battery life. Mercifully due to it's poor build quality it did not survive a 3 foot drop to the ground, so I replaced it with a real phone. Avoid at all costs."
B072N6BD9V,John Mathurin,1,"Like the size of phone, I ordered it while in the US but now I am on island it comes on but cannot receive or place calls I am very disappointed."
B072N6BD9V,Diana Manuele,1,"Slow battery up load slow ,clicking in maps stops on it's own to big for my hands very slow damaged I am sure.

B072N6BD9V,JSF,4,This is a an excellent value. It is working great so far.
B072N6BD9V,Lagg,2,"The phone itself looks nice, feels comfortable, and so fourth. The phone freezes all the time! It is as slow as all hell! I do NOT recommend bto buy this device"
B072N6BD9V,panther721,1,"I should have learned after buying one Blu dumb phone. Nope, I unfortunately had to put myself through more aggravation. Just about 2 days after activating my newest acquisition. The A6 awesome looking Blu cell phone an update took place and took my camera. Leaving not only myself but some other very cell savy people dumbfounded. The space it comes with is ridiculous. It should be for a toddlers toy. I am unable to update any apps without deleting apps every time. I have, I believe 5 apps left of my choice other than the ones you're basically STUCK with despite all efforts of doing away with them. The latest disappointment and 2nd biggest one is my messaging/text app has requested to be updated and since I'm unable to do so without having to sacrifice and delete my 3 main apps of importance to me I.e, email. LOL Has left me with a non working text. I am able to send texts but they actually go into cyberspace and cyberspace only because no one ever receives them LOL and I now, no longer ever receive any texts. My sending out a text is quite similar to the response I received from any help or replacement. No response. It's too bad, I thought I found a solution to long term contracts in return of a nice sized, decent smart phone. To top it off .. before my 1st Blu cell phone nightmares began, I, unfortunately have referred many people due to my large social media presence that went ahead and acquired Blu cell phones and all because of me!"
B072N6BD9V,rosaeme,2,"I can hardly hear the voice of the caller and have to use headphones because the volume is extremely low. I need to know if this is a problem with this particular equipment I received or if all who have bought an A6 Blu have the same complaint. Also, the screen suddenly starts moving and in the screen appear lots of horizontal lines. I just want to know if any of you have experienced these problems with your A6 Advance Blu. Thank you"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,"Excelente producto y responsabilidad con la entrega, gracias"
B072N6BD9V,SYoung,1,"Purchased as a gift for niece, and by day four of use it went into ""safe mode"". The phone has not been used a great deal and has only been used enough for two chargings. It is now day 14 and when plugging it in to charge it give a plethora of error, reboot, wipe data, messages; this same thing happen during the first instance of plugging it in to charge. I am optimistic that it is just a dud and will now attempt to replace it with the same model. Let's see how easy this process will be!"
B072N6BD9V,Irene Gomez,1,"Este disculpe pero esta telÃ©fono no me sirviÃ³ porque solo unos dÃ­as me funcionÃ³ y ahora ni a garantizar carga y ni ensiende por que yo lo mande a mi paÃ­s , y le diera mÃ¡s estrellas pero ya no funciona"
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,3,"Battery don't last more than five hour I have to keep charging I'll time and apps bouncing. This is suppose yo be a new phone , I shall returned or what is only one month of use great phone?."
B072N6BD9V,CRT,2,I have owned 5 different cell phones. This BLU A6 is the worst of all. I do not recommend. Every thing about it is bad: continues charging it doesn't hold the charge. Speed isn't there at all. Your apps keep turning off. I threw mine. Just didn't want to deal with it anymore. After three (3) weeks. DON'T BUY IT!! You will regret it.
B072N6BD9V,Rose1960,1,Pop up warning about apps that was open or the phone rings and there is no way to answer it the worst phone I ever brought call the company and run around starts
B072N6BD9V,shaquan waddygriffin,1,Phone is the worst force close no memory it's big for nothing
B072N6BD9V,Annise Bryan-White,1,I purchased thus phone as a gift. However the quality of the phone was horrible. It only holds a charge for 2-2.5 hours and takes just as long to charge it.it does not have good picture or flash/lightening qualites. We tried all the troubleshooting suggestions made by BLU customer service. Nothing worked!!! Because they is in another country it has been impossible to find a battery replacement. I saw no sense in paying for the return if the phone and hope to get ALL of my monies refunded.
B072N6BD9V,freewater,1,this is definitely a entry model phone.
B072N6BD9V,Rose,5,I was really impressed with all that came with the phone. It had a case screen protector also ear bugs all that wasn't even mentioned. The delivery was fast the phone is good..
B072N6BD9V,Hilary,1,"I honestly hate complaining about phones but this one I wish I could give a lower rating because ever since I bought this phone it has been issue after issue with this thing:
apps are slow to start and are slow in general and glitchy
it'll say a certain app isnt working even though that app isnt even open
I cant have to many apps on it because then it freezes and acts up

I could go on and on but all in all this is the worst phone I have ever owned. Seriously I'm considering buying another one bore I end up throwing this one into a wall"

B072N6BD9V,Mike,4,It's not a bad phone. The only thing I don't like is it freezes up sometimes and it can get very slow.
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,5,One of the best phones u have used in a while. I appreciate the focused strategy of the seller
B072N6BD9V,Amazon Customer,1,This phone failed to power on at the initial stage. I returned it immediately.

B072N6BD9V,farees mohammed,2,Was disappointed with its functionality. it was very slow in processing from one app to other or using navigation.
B072N6BD9V,Jared E. Berg,1,"This is by far the worst phone I have ever had, it's unbelievably slow and ceases to function frequently. I didn't expect much from a phone this cheap but even then, it's still overpriced for what you get. I shouldn't have to restart my phone every time I want to send a message, but this is a reality with this piece of garbage. Avoid frustration and just buy an iphone or a Samsung."

B01F48QLFA,Alexis,1,"When we got the phone, the previous owner's information was still on the phone. That was bad enough, but now, after just 4 months, the phone has crashed and is completely dead. Even though the phone appears completely fine, hasn't been dropped, and hasn't been wet, Verizon employees said it was done. Unless this seller follows up and something changes, our recommendation is to avoid them."
B01F48QLFA,Mark F,4,"I had a Verizon LG G4 on Straight Talk and I loved it. However, it finally succumbed to the dreaded boot loop effect that LG is currently being sued for. I was looking at a V20 from LG but I read that it, too, was part of the class action law suit and as far as a refurbished G6 for about $40 more, well, sorry, LG, but you've pissed me off now.

I started looking at alternatives, and it came down to the HTC 10 or a refurbished Samsung Galaxy S7. After much searching and reading reviews, I settled on the S7. There were several vendors offering them, and I went with DealFisher because they had the ""fulfillment by Amazon Warehouse"" label. Amazon is pretty picky, so I figured they'd be held to a higher standard than these other 3rd party vendors. I paid an extra $8 for next-day shipping.

Package arrived on time, in a generic box with an aftermarket charger and USB cable. The phone itself was in excellent condition for a refurbished model. There are 3 small, very light scratches on the otherwise flawless glass on the front. I didn't notice them when I first got the phone, so it could be a result of sitting in my pocket with my keys (screen protector is on the way). There are signs of wear on the plastic bezel around the camera lens, and whatever it is that covers the flash and IR sensor (I read it's some kind of polyurethane coating and shows scratches easily but doesn't effect the functionality) has several marks on it. Everything else on the phone looks brand new. I'm using a Supcase case for it and it fits perfectly.

As far as the phone itself, I really like it. Fast and smooth, camera is very good, low-light shots are the best I've ever seen on a phone. the screen quality is amazing. I like watching 4K videos on YouTube just so I can bask in the S7's pixel density goodness! It's eye-candy.

I like the size, it's not too big and not too small. Bluetooth works well and pairs with my devices just fine. Audio sounds good and is plenty loud enough, in both earphones and speaker. One thing that irked me about the G4 was no native FLAC support. The S7 plays them just fine with no need for a 3rd party paid-for app like Poweramp. UPDATE: Does not play M4A audio files, so back to Poweramp.

My G4 had a pretty finicky battery that would rarely get me through the day. The S7 seems to be much better in this regard. Also, the G4's lock screen would randomly come on all the time, and I don't have that issue at all with the S7 (I disabled the Always On Display feature).

My G4 never received updates and it irked the crap out of me. I guess it had something to do with being a Verizon phone using a Straight Talk SIM card. One thing I had to do with the S7 was to get a new SIM card, since it uses a NanoSIM, not a MicroSIM. Surprisingly, upon connecting to the Verizon network it showed an update available and now I have Android 7.0 on my new S7.

Time will tell just how durable this refurbished model is. If anything goes wrong, I'll update my review.

Bottom line: For just over $230, it's a very nice deal for what is still a great phone that doesn't seem dated to me at all. I like it."
B01F48QLFA,Ed B.,5,"This cell phone was available from a number of different sellers, with mixed reviews across the board, and almost the same pricing. I opted to go with Dealfisher and was very pleased with the entire order process. See a ""seller review"" separately. As far as the phone goes, I was a little bit hesitant at going with a refurbished unit, but it was almost $250 cheaper than purchasing new from Verizon. I'm glad I took the chance. The phone is to any non-technical examination brand new. Not a scratch, rub mark or any other discernible indication that it has ever been used before. It did NOT come with a sim card, or memory card, but that was clearly indicated in the product description. What I did not know was that the Galaxy S5, that I was replacing, has a ""micro sim card"" and the Galaxy S7 (the new phone) has a ""nano sim card"". They are NOT the same. That's the bad news. The good news is that my local Verizon store (NOT and authorized vendor, but a ""real"" Verizon store), installed a new nano card in a couple of minutes and then, since they weren't busy, cross loaded all of the contents from the old phone to the new...at NO cost! It can't get better than that. By the way, the memory card IS the same for both phones. Hope you get the same great results I did. Cheers...Ed B."
B01F48QLFA,Chris and Holli Denmark,5,"Phone looks and acts like it's in absolute brand new condition. My phone came with they legitimate Samsung fast charger, USB converter too store information, and a set of really nice Samsung earbuds. The only thing that doesn't scream this is brand new phone is that it came in a plain white box and cost $250 less than new!"
B01F48QLFA,MICHAEL E REX,5,"If you get what you ordered, this is a really nifty phone. When I decided to upgrade from my 2.5-year-old Galaxy Core Prime, I researched Samsung's flagships back to the S4, and decided the S7 is where they finally got all the changes right. Great screen, camera, plenty of memory plus expansion slot, runs android 7, and oodles of options, settings, and customization. The fingerprint unlock is a nice feature. To me, this phone is also the perfect size, and will still fit in a normal pocket.
Only cons so far: finding a screen protector that fits may be difficult, and the notification LED is smaller and dimmer than I am used to, making it hard to notice from a distance.
It took me two tries to get the proper phone, however. There are numerous third-party vendors all selling under this same product description, and I surmise there may be some tension as to what counts as a ""refurbished"" item. The product description seems to indicate minor defects are acceptable. Amazon's definition seems to indicate it should be repaired, cleaned, and essentially remanufactured to original, like-new specs. Now, I have purchased refurbished on Amazon before with great results: A couple Samsung WiFi cams that were as good as new, and a DSLR, refurbished by Nikon USA itself, that was stunningly immaculate. Alas, the first phone I received did not meet that standard, and was more what I would consider used but decently well taken care of (light glass scratches, dirt/corrosion in speaker and microphone ports). It was also the wrong model, G930U instead of V, and had an ESN that Verizon could not recognize and activate. No SIM card for me! That last bit, of course, was the deal-breaker.
Luckily, I had selected an Amazon-fulfilled item, so return and refund was of course fast and painless. I repurchased from a different seller, also Amazon-fulfilled, and the only one who could deliver before the weekend. I then timely received a pristine S7 that truly exemplifies what I would call refurbished or remanufactured, and am most pleased. The short extra wait to get it totally right was well worth it."
B01F48QLFA,Matt PA,1,"Certified Samsung refurbished phone had many problems out of the box. After-market accessories, charged very hot, screen had a light 1/3 section that jiggled, black colors were green, speaker cut in and out, mobile reception strength started out half of previous phone and decreased to near zero. I would rate this refurbish very poor quality. I give this less than a star."
B01F48QLFA,Callan Smith,1,"The phone is missing the Verizon Voicemail app. And spoiler alert you can't add it. According to Verizon support it is something that has to be added when the phone is first configured. Also per Verizon they say this means its not really a Verizon phone, its just a phone that will work on the Verizon network. Ultimately what this all means is you can't tell if you have a voicemail, how many voicemails you have, who they are from or when they were left. You have to dial the voicemail number and then listen to each message in its entirety and then check the info on the voicemail to get any info about it. For someone who lives their life by their phone this is a no go. If this would have been disclosed in the product description I would have picked another phone."
B01F48QLFA,AA,1,Not truly unlocked. Went to several carriers and none have been able to activate the phone. Sending back.
B01F48QLFA,Brenda K. Leon,2,"Update: after rebooting the phone 5 times and doing a system update I was finally able to use the fingerprint sensor to unlock my phone. I should not have had to go through all that frustration, but I think I may have fixed the problem. :(
I would give this company zero stars if I could. I received the phone and when I put the sim in I keep getting a notification that unauthorized actions have been detected. Because if this, I cannot use many apps, including the fingerprint security and Samsungâs own Health app. I have restarted the phone to no avail. I then did a factory reset and that didnât work. I still get the same message. This phone is a piece of you know what. I am sending it back for a full refund. Unfortunately, this company will probably just send the defective phone to the next person who orders one so buys beware! ð¡ð¤¬"
B01F48QLFA,Adam S. Guida,5,"For what it's worth, I bought my phone from DealFisher and it was great. Battery is very strong and only one or two minor scratches that suggest this thing was hardly used. It was no trouble getting this phone switched over to my existing Verizon service. Last thing to note was that my package just included the phone and charger without any other extras. That's fine with me. Just happy I got a good one!"
B01F48QLFA,MisfitMike,1,Phone showed up on time looked great until I powers it on. The screen only updated the left side when selecting options the right side kept going black. Just ordered another one will be sending first one back.
B01F48QLFA,Reid Anderson,1,"Great phone overall when battery isn't dieing. Purchased this phone thinking it was great deal since it was refurbished. However my battery life is horrible phone dies in like 2 hours. I need to get a battery replacement now. Phone performance is good and has very nice camera. I'm just a little salty because In Constantly having to charge my phone.

**** I had to get different phone battery was horrible feel ripped off"
B01F48QLFA,Crtsdxn,2,"BEWARE
-Phone aesthetically looks great.
-Charge port is loose.
-Unable to get rid of software update notification (run update and it still keeps coming back up every time. Tried factory reset and didn't fix problem.
-Battery life is very bad. Complete discharge within normal conditions (very little usage) from 100% at 6am to 45% at 10am to 0% by 2:30pm. Not possible to replace battery since it is a integrated battery / device.
-Called customer service and they will issue a refund or replacement but I have to go without a phone until new one arrives after they received this defective one.
-I have to go to Verizon to get a micro SIM (had to cut old one to fit GS7 nano SIM slot) for my old device just to send this one back, or go without a phone.

UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OVERALL."
B01F48QLFA,Noah Pierce,5,"So when I was initially looking to buy a new phone I knew that I didn't need the newest or shiniest phone so I decided to buy a phone that was a few generations back. But I debated about where to buy a used phone. I researched for a long time and went back and forth with a lot of websites and Amazon had the cheapest price, which made me both happy and a little bit warry. But I decided to go with the phone on Amazon, I choose my seller carefully to a one that had good reviews and a high quantity of reviews. When it came the phone had no defects and looked brand new! It didn't have a sim card (but I knew it wouldn't) All in all great phone great deal! I waited to write my review for a couple of months just to make sure. So I highly reccomend buying a used phone."
B01F48QLFA,Collinsb,5,"The Samsung S7 is great! After my Note 5 took a bath and quit..I replaced with Samsung J7 both are great phones and very similar with the exception of the cameras. The J7 while nice, didn't have the camera as the Note 5.

I opted to try a refurbished Samsung S7. You would never know it wasn't brand new. For less than $270 I've got a flagship handset, with an incredible camera and expandable storage. I highly recommend expandable storage if you enjoy taking pictures and loading mp3 files.

I often drop my phone and rougher than most...so I couldn't justify the cost of an S8 or the newer S9 model phone. I'm very happy with the S7 and glad I took a chance on a refurbished item."
B01F48QLFA,B.S.C,5,"Perfect quality and flawless performance. I had a brand new Galaxy S7, which I lost after about 6 months of use, and I decided to replace it with this refurbished S7. Because I had been using the exact same (but brand new) phone just prior to using this refurbished, I can undoubtedly confirm that this performs the same, and it looks and feels brand new as well. No scratches, no dings, not even any dirt or dust in the speaker grill etc. At first I was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but all my worries were for no reason with this seller. Thank you!"
B01F48QLFA,Roy Merritt,3,"Aside from a little rash around the charging port from being used, the phone was like new. No scratches, no issues. phone been working great so far. Bought it for my wife, I may order myself one now.
UPDATE: 09/12/18
I purchased this to replace my wife's Galaxy S5 (I am still using mine). Since she bought it I have not been happy with her call quality. I have a hard time understanding her unless she speaks deliberately and clearly. 5 months later I realize that we are not being connected using the HD Voice option on Verizon phones. The ""Advanced Calling"" options are not present on this phone. I spent hours with VZW Support and Samsung support to no avail. Samsung told me that a phone that has been unlocked does not have these features. Verizon says that this must not have been a Verizon phone and that's why it is not available. The phone I bought from Deal Fisher was supposed to be a Verizon phone and was not listed as an unlocked phone. Ultimately I am overly disappointed. My S5 has way better call quality and now I am hesitant to replace it with another one off of Amazon."
B01F48QLFA,Cheryl V.,5,"I bought this phone to replace my aging S4 that was still working but getting tired. The S4 was in an otter box all it's life and had a few battery replacements since i bought it new. Back in those days smartphones were free when you signed a 2 year contract so I had a bit of sticker shock when I went phone shopping. I'm over 60 and retired, I just don't need the latest gadget filled cell phone.

I read all the reviews for this S7 phone on Amazon and found a wide mix of comments from junk to like new condition. The thing that sold me on this one is that Amazon certified it with this statement ""A Certified Refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by a 3rd party distributor""
Certified to work and look like new from Amazon's description means to me I could return the phone if I was not completely satisfied with it's condition. The 3rd party distributor for my phone was Kiss Electronics.
I live in SoCal and ordered the phone with Prime 2 day delivery, to my surprise it arrived the very next day!

first Impressions,
I opened the prime box to find a generic phone box inside. When I opened the phone box I found the phone, a wall charger, and a phone number for Kiss electronics customer support, that's it. No manual, no release key for the sim card and no instruction manual. I was soon encouraged by the like new external condition of the phone and I saw what appeared to be a factory original peel off plastic screen cover on it. I plugged it into the provided Amazon marked charger to find the battery was completely discharged. I found a safety pin to release the sim card holder and quickly realized my old S4 Verizon sim card was way to big to fit. The next day I went to the Verizon store and they happily supplied me with a nano sim card. I asked them if they could transfer all my old contact info from the old sim to the new one and I was told that is not possible. Now that I know about the sim card data transfer problem, I would have used google in advance to back up all my data first before going to the Verizon store. Oh well, I transferred all my data the old fashioned way, hey I'm retired, who cares.
After getting the new nano sim card installed I was ready to try out the phone.

I turned the phone on to update my contacts, then decided to check for Android operating system updates. I found that it was currently running Marshmallow 6.0. I updated the first, then the second, then the 3rd. On and on for a total of about 7 different operating system updates, it took a few hours to complete all the upgrades. It updated all the way to Oreo v. 8.0. This is when I realized this must be a new old stock phone that has not ever been operated or used before.
I had read that manufactures (like Samsung) often have many brand new phones that are earmarked for their warranty exchange programs. I suspect these phones were new phones that were not needed by the manufacture and were sold at auction to various electronic device distributors (like Kiss Electronics)

I have had the phone now for about a week. After removing the bloatware and configuring it the way I want it, I am very happy with it. I would highly recommend this phone for anyone on a budget or whoever doesn't need the latest and greatest cell phone on the market. I rate my entire experience with Amazon and Kiss Electronics A+"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,"Phone did not have software compatible with Verizon and so cannot be activated. Despite multiple attempts to factory reset and to update the software through Verizon's software tool on my computer, I cannot use the phone with a new SIM card from Verizon. Since it was sold as a Verizon phone, that renders it essentially useless to me. After spending 2 hours on the phone with Verizon tech support, following by 2 hours of my own time attempting to reset the phone, I'll be returning this for a refund. I still have no phone, after waiting over a week for this one--an enormous waste of time for a useless device.

My options now include rolling the device and waiting another week to get a new phone from Amazon/this seller, or switching to another seller and phone on Verizon. Either way, I'm left without a working device for another week."
B01F48QLFA,Dan Baxley,4,"I give the product 5 stars, but the delivery was all over the place. It finally arrived a couple of days late. Who knows what happened, but the package arrived in excellent condition, so the extra routing did it no harm. The Cell phone is like brand new. It is a beautiful phone and my wife loves it. In fact, after a few days of use, we like it so much I ordered one for myself. AND GUESS WHAT? It to has gotten lose in route, can you believe it? I keep getting apologies for the lateness and when I track it it seems to be zigging and zagging its way to my address. Never had this problem before when ordering PRIME from Amazon, weird. I do not mind it come days late if it is in the same condition as the phone my wife received. I would buy it again. I liked the S8 and S9 but the roll over screen appears to be too sensitive for me. My kids have these and you cannot pick it up without setting something off. This S7 can be bought in the EDGE model but I prefer the standard screen. The fact it is water proof (? resistant) and dust proof is a plus.

UPDATE: I liked this phone so much I ordered on for myself. And guess what? It too seemed to have gotten lost en-route. When I did received it the packaging was fine, just a late delivery. Also, I had assumed this was a Factory Refurbished, like the one I bought for my wife, but it came in a different product package and without the Refurb. stickers. The phone looks like new but has a warning on the inside saying that it only has a 60 day return warranty, as opposed to the 90 day warranty of the Cert. Refurb. models? So far the phone is working flawless and is like new -- I would guess it is actually a new phone, except it came with a Nokia charge cable, and a small transformer charger that is not from Samsung. I have found a flaw, the headphone plug is crap. You have to hold the plug in with pressure or it will not work. For me? I don't care about that because I never use headphones. Everything else looks like new. I have marked my calendar for the 60 trial, because that is what it is, for me. Both of these phones came through Amazon Prime and say the supplier is Samsung, so I am assuming they both came from the same distributor, but the difference in packaging says otherwise? We will see."
B01F48QLFA,CFrieberg,5,"I purchased this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that bricked on me last weekend. The refurbished price is so much better than new from Verizon. When the phone arrived, it was in a plain box, and no OEM charger (but I have one from my other phone so no big deal). The phone works great! Setup was a breeze. I've used it pretty heavily the past week (so many new features with latest OS) - and it's great. No complaints."
B01F48QLFA,Snidely,5,Works as spec. Battery life is as new. Updated immediately to Android 7.0 when first started. I just plugged in my sim card from my old Galaxy S7 Edge (I prefer the S7 by the way) - et voila!
B01F48QLFA,u didnt see nuthin,2,"The phone looks perfect. It came with an off brand charger that does not seem to charge it, but that is not a big deal to me, as I have chargers that do work. This did not come with ear buds either, which is also not a big deal to me but may be for someone else. It took a full week to get delivered which took way to long. Amazon has rarely taken that long. Once I finally received this phone, I did the smart switch from my Samsung s5 to this s7. That was easy and worked perfectly. I got everything set up and it all worked great. So I finally switched my sim card and ready to make calls. That's when everyone I talked to on the phone said they had a hard time hearing me. They can't hear during the call unless I use the speaker phone. Since it's not always feasible or appropriate to be on speaker this is a huge issue. Calling Amazon tech support I was told to install any updates or reset the phone to factory settings. Neither of those things worked. With regret, I will have to find another option."
B01F48QLFA,Lanny A. Netz,4,"I believe this is going to be my best phone yet. It came in the time promised and it looks to be brand new. Setting it up and transferring my data was a breeze. I love the ""always on"" screen that shows the time and date as well as certain other information. Really a handsome phone that is the right size for me.
The only reason I have not given it 5 stars is that I don't have my sim card yet, so I can't actually use it as a phone, just wi-fi. But I will have that installed soon and I imagine it will be wonderful."
B01F48QLFA,P. C. Hammond,1,"Four month's into owning what I thought was a decent phone, it has turned into a brick. Listening to music last night I heard a peculiar zip like sound and the music stopped. I knew it was fully charged, but it wouldn't respond to any button pressing. I tried plugging it in this morning with no effect. Later my screen lit up with nothing but static. I'm not sure what to replace it with. New phones are prohibitively expensive."
B01F48QLFA,Dan D,5,"So far, so good. It is very hard to tell that this phone is a refurbished phone and not new. I received it last Thursday and have been busy installing updates, apps and accounts in order to switch over from my existing Windows phone. I have not activated on my Verizon network but I have verified, by swapping my old phone's SIM card into the S7, that it could connect to the Verizon network in CDMA LTE mode. Once I've configured it I'll need to go to a Verizon store, get a new SIM, and activate it. Other than that this refurbished phone seems like it will work just as expected with a new phone. I will update this review once the activation is complete and I've been able to put it to actual day-to-day use."
B01F48QLFA,Tony,1,"The phone was suppose to be black. I received gold and also it was built for service in Vietnam.

Phone says it is G930V but it is actually G930U. Also, it is not really a Samsung galaxy S7 but a replica (fake) settings do not allow for HD voice/ video chat."
B01F48QLFA,Hani EL Hazzouri,5,"Keep in mind that I only got the phone today so this review doesnt cover long term issues.

Condition: It looks new and has no damage what so ever. Now it might not have the shine or feel of a new phone, but I put it under strong light looking for any signs of damage and I found none. Touch screen is perfect and all the buttons work. I'm a little worried that the home button might fail in time (it does feel a little weird) but for now its responsive so no complaints. The phone also has a Verizon logo at the back.

Packaging and delivery: I dont have prime. I ordered this on Monday afternoon and I got it on Saturday. Not bad. The shipping box had the protective air bubbles and all. The phone does NOT come with the original packaging. As the case with most refurbished products it comes in a generic box. It had a changer and a short USB cable but no headphones (bummer). It also doesnt have the user manual but who reads that.

The phone takes a nano sim and I micro SD. I had to replace my sim at the Verizon store and they added me to the network no problem. I'm not sure if this phone works with other networks but it does have setup guide for non-Verizon carrier. The battery doesnt seem as bad as some reviews are saying, but then again I've had my S5 for almost 3 years so anything will feel like an upgrade."
B01F48QLFA,Corbin Blanchard,3,"The screen has lots of minor abrasions which make it extremely prone to retaining many fingerprints and oils. The earpiece is all scratched up (the black paint is chipping off of it a lot), and the home button has a big chunk taken out of the middle of it. The corners are also pretty dinged up and the charging port is filthy as though it wasn't ever cleaned out with alcohol as it should have been - I cleaned the charging port myself when the phone failed to charge at first. Cleaning it did the trick. The power button is finicky and doesn't always function on the first press. The microphone and speaker holes are also somewhat dirty right out of the box. The phone still functions just fine aside from these points, however, and it seems to still have its waterproof properties. The SIM card tray is perfectly intact as it should be, and there are no scratches in front of any of the cameras, luckily. The last owner of this phone certainly didn't go out of their way to keep it clean or take care of it with a protective case or even a screen protector. Adding a screen protector does help with the scratches that are all over the screen, at least. You get what you pay for I guess, but I am mostly happy with the phone so far simply because it is surely an upgrade from the S6 that I had before this."
B01F48QLFA,Harris M.,2,"Product works as a phone. Headphone jack does not. I don't have time to return it because I actively need a cell phone for business. I'd appreciate changing wording from ""Refurbished"" to ""used"" or ""broken"". Just so consumers are clear on what's up. ""Like new"" should be pretty clear and apply to things that are, yknow, like new. Thanks."
B01F48QLFA,Nannys Stuff,5,"I have been a Blackberry person for over 20 years. One of my first cell phones was a Blackberry. My husband checked me for a temperature when I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S7. So, I LOVE IT!!!! I have had very little trouble getting use to the the new icons. The phone works so similar to my Samsung Tablet that I really did not have any trouble converting. Phone was in excellent, like new shape and ported right over to my Verizon plan. I had to do a couple hours of download on OS updates about a week after I began using it, but went to Verizon store and used their data, saving mine for my stuff. The size is excellent for me to carry. The features are clear and easy to use. The price was GREAT!! Delivery was as stated. Totally satisfied!"
B01F48QLFA,J & K Schmidt,1,"Item was defective, screen broken, huge pink lines flickering before 90 day warranty was up, contacted company 1 day after 90 day warranty period which apparently starts when it was ordered, not received and would not help me out at all.

I had not had the phone active for more than 60 days when this happened."
B01F48QLFA,Kathryn,4,"Really nice phone for the price! Everything on it is perfect, except when I try to play music through the aux cord in my car, it has a loud, annoying static sound that won't go away. I can bypass this though a bluetooth adapter, though, so it's not a huge issue, and it's the only issue I've had thus far. Everything else works amazing and it looks like new. Another minor issue was shipping. I ordered this phone last Thursday and paid extra for one day shipping, but the phone arrived the following Wednesday. The phone is nice enough that it wasn't a huge issue, but definitely don't pay extra for one day shipping or expect this phone to arrive in a hurry."
B01F48QLFA,Justen Hunt,3,"The battery life on this is terrible, it last about 2 hours. the Operating system is about as slow as Christmas and apps quit on me faster then battery does. Will probably return, not worth the hassle. Not to mention risking what feels like first degree burns from the thing overheating in my hand.
Pros:
-Cute ability to let Google rule over everything
-Android
-Can cook eggs and the Waterproof-ness prevents that yoke from entering the phone

Cons:
-Low security
-Heats up to the point where I thawed out two cavemen to show them this marvel of technology, they said it was dumb and used it to make fire
-slow
-battery dies faster then my last relationship(Star if you read this I miss you you)"
B01F48QLFA,Francis Piraino,2,"It looked like a good deal until I tried to get it to connect to Verizon, come to find out is wasn't a Verizon phone, had to send it back (I paid shipping), bought a brand new one on eBay cheaper, no tax, that one was defective, had to finally send it back, I am using my old S5, bought a new case, makes me think it is new, oh well i had a black cloud flying over me that week."
B01F48QLFA,Angela,2,"Whoever this phone belonged to before me (the seller) knew that this phone had an issue, that is why it was sold for such a cheap price. Yes it was a refurbished phone, BUT still with an ongoing issue. This phone requires a system update all day everyday, but once it is done, nothing reflects that update and then it asks for another update. It is a never ending request! I have to keep allowing the phone to update and reboot and I do not have another phone that I can use to send this one back. I can make and receive calls, text, etc. for the most part, but the last phone that I had was a decent phone, it just did not have enough storage space and a terrible camera, but it did not require updates every morning or every night! I need storage space and a great camera with great pictures. I am disappointed and I have NEVER done a bad review about anything that I received through Amazon! (I do understand that each seller is different, but this could cause issues in the future)"
B01F48QLFA,LAGoodluck,4,"I ordered two of these certified refurbished phones. One was great: in really good shape and worked perfectly, the othe one same shape but the microphone didn't work. We have sent it back for a replacement. It has not arrived yet so we don't know if there are any problems with it."
B01F48QLFA,London,5,"I love my S7. I cracked the screen on my old one and I was told I could trade it in for an S8 but instead I purchased another S7. I will be sad when I actually have to give up my S7 for something else.

The shipping was quick and the packaging was fine.

I will say that the battery life on my phone was so short that I was charging it 4 times a day. I purchased a replacement battery and replaced it myself. It was a little tricky but worth it because I love this phone.

The camera on this phone is great. I take tons of photos! I have yet to run out of room. I also use my phone to record videos and it's fine!"
B01F48QLFA,amber,5,I'm giving 5 stars. The product is exactly what it was described to be. It works awesome. I've had no issues this far with one exception. Phone kept prompting to have software update. I tried to update from phone several times with no success so instead I used my pc which as long as it works then that's all that matters. The phone came in 2 days early which was awesome! I have purchased several phones online and this is by far one of the better ones.
B01F48QLFA,Mandy30,5,So glad I decided to purchase Amazon certified refurbished.The phone I received was like new and fully functional. No problems activating it to my Verizon account. Battery life lasts all day with medium use. Came with a Samsung quick charger. I couldn't be happier with the performance and quality of this phone.
B01F48QLFA,John C. Mills,5,"A refurbished phone that looks new. I upgraded from an S4 and the speed of the S7 is much better along with 16 more GB. The colors are crisp and I love the ""push the home button twice"" feature that takes you directly to the camera. Great phone!"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,3,"I bought this after my s8 was stolen. Sure it's waterproof is a ""smartphone"" but that's where I draw the line. Somehow because it's been refurbished this just doesn't want to work properly. My snapchat app in particular just refuses to work- one app, whatever. But what's worse is that the LED had a strange tint across the entire screen almost like a blue light filter (not enabled) and seemed to have an icon fade from the previous owner's layout. It also doesn't work with other settings like trying to change the ringtone- it refuses to use anything but the system default. It's been 6 months so I've given up on that by now. The charger that the phone came with? A joke. Broke in 2 months. The home button seemed to ""scratch off"" so it looks like it's been chipped away. I have a very good case so unsure how this happened. I tried to contact customer service for a refund/replacement within 30 days but I guess the ONE woman who has to process that wasn't there that day? So after calling the next day a man tells me that he can only process a 10% refund because the LED problem was a ""minor problem"" but I didn't have my order number on me so I had to call back. When I called again, the next person I needed to talk to was not there. So I gave up. It still works, but disappointed in the ""refurbishment"" skills for the price. Would NOT buy again. Buy a new Motorola for the same price. I should have gone through with the return. Also the battery lasts less than 7 hrs with medium use so good luck bringing it to school/work without a charger. I think new this phone is good but refurbished is not. (Side note: I've been buying Samsungs my whole life)."
B01F48QLFA,Grandma,3,"I would not consider this a certified refurb. It came with generic charger that wasn't useable so I'm using a Galaxy S charger I had from another product. Phone charges to 100% but does not stay charged more than 12 hours even with very limited use, notifications and smart background off. Wish I had spend the extra on something more certain. ANY Certified Refurbished ELECTRONIC Item Ive purchased previously always came with a name brand charger and good battery life therefore I am disappointed."
B01F48QLFA,Matthew Majchrzak,5,I've ordered a number of used cell phones and had to send a few back. The ones from Prime Mobility have always held up and outlasted any others! This S7 was great. Amazing condition and everything synched up right away after putting my SIM in. Battery life has been good as well. Will always go to Prime Mobility storefront first!!
B01F48QLFA,Ryan Bertelli,5,"We decided to purchase an S7 for my wife (the year is 2018) because her iPhone 6 crapped out at the 1st sign of water. She saw how mine has been with us since our wedding day in reliability, functionality, so we decided to get a refurbished on Amazon since they don't make them anymore. She loves it, although there's a learning curve coming from iPhone, it works great and the battery life is like it was new. Were running these bases boys into the ground."
B01F48QLFA,Essenbe,5,I was a little concerned about buying a refurbished cell phone but decided to take a chance. It looked new out of the box and has been working like new as well. There seems to be a wide range of reviews on these phones. I think it depends on who you buy them from. The issue I have when reading reviews is that is the one thing nobody mentions in most cases. Mine was purchased from BuySPRY. It has been an excellent phone so far and I am glad I went with a refurbished phone now.
B01F48QLFA,Christina,5,"I ordered from Electronic deals. The first one received, wouldn't connect when I put in the SIM card. Contacted the seller, and they were great. Sent back the cell with the overnight postage covered by them. Recieved another soon after. Works great! Love it. Battery isn't as good as I hoped, but better than my old one and charges fast with the fast charger I have. Just bought wireless charger and can't wait to recieved it! Highly recommend the seller electronic deals!"
B01F48QLFA,ScottyTheBody,4,"I am mostly please with the purchase. The phone looks great cosmetically and works great. Only problem is with the battery. The battery is not good and I would have rated this only 3 stars. I get about 6 hours of light use before phone's completely dead, 2 hr's to 3 hr's max if I'm talking on it and have the blue tooth earpiece connected . We have another S7 we purchased new about 18 months ago, and when configured identically and placed side by side with the one we purchased from Kiss Electronics we can see an obvious difference on remaining battery power within 10-15 minutes. However, I called Amazon customer service and explained the problem. They quickly offered to credit me $20 so I could purchase a new replacement battery, which I have ordered and will swap out with the bad one soon. So, I've raised my rating to 4 stars because of the incredibly responsive customer service response and my belief that a new battery will resolve my only problem with the phone. Lastly, the S7 battery replacement process looks to be a little more than just a quick swap out. It involves special tools, heat gun, etc (I suggest watching a YouTube Video before attempting this battery swap). I will update this review after I replace the battery."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Love it. Had an S5 but was having battery and display issues. This was a nice upgrade. I don't need all the bells and whistles of the latest models and the price for this was certainly right. I have bought refurbished phones before with no issues and there certainly have been none with this one. The SIM card is a different size so I couldn't just swap in the one from my S5, but I got one for free from Verizon (took some convincing, however, Verizon store personnel didn't seem to know that they were allowed to give me one without the phone in hand)."
B01F48QLFA,Paul Taylor,4,Few scuffs and scratches but it was refurbished so no big surprise. Phone was completely dead so I put it on the charger. It started to charge for less than a minute and the charging box made a really weird noise then it popped and stopped working. The phone went off and came back on by itself. I guess it was a problem with the charger because I've had no problems with the phone since I started using my old charging box.
B01F48QLFA,kayla larry,4,"Great phone! Had it for a few days now! Everything is great, got it on time. Came with a lighting charger. Still waiting on a SIM card in the mail to know if the phone works when activated
UPDATE: had the phone for a while now and my data stopped working so I restarted the phone and I wonât turn back on it just vibrates/ had it on the charger for maybe an hour and still wonât come on. I looked it up and itâs common for this phone. It was great until I restarted it :("
B01F48QLFA,Frank James,5,"The S7 arrived in perfect condition.
Couldn't tell the difference, between Refurbished and New
Set up was a breeze. I would buy it again."
B01F48QLFA,quilt lady 2,4,"That I can use my waterproof fit bit with it. That it keeps updating every day, sometimes even twice in a day. This is my first smart phone and I am finding it hard to learn all it can do. Call me a tech dummy! I hope that by the time I really need to use it for something that I can do it."
B01F48QLFA,Momr0cks,5,"The phone was as described, refurbished in good condition. We transferred a SIM card and had no problem activating the phone on our Verizon account. The seller provided warranty and contact information In the box. My son is very pleased with his new phone."
B01F48QLFA,steelernation.51,5,I had a rewarding experience with this purchase. I would recommend it. My order came as describe and for the price .I had a great deal. The phone was in a great shipping package and shipment was really fast. Thank you so much and will recommend you to family and friends.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought this phone about a week ago and so far, I have been very impressed with it. It came rather fast and sooner than expected. When I took the phone out of the box, it looked brand new with no scratches or obvious imperfections. The phone started right up and the screen looked perfect. Overall, I'm very impressed with this phone and would greatly consider buying another phone from ths company in the future."
B01F48QLFA,Gwendolyn Johnson,5,"My refurbished samsung galaxy 7 came flawless, and, after inserting Consumer Cellular sim card, and 64 gig storage , and learning my new phone, it does some amazing things, and, takes cool photo's and videos on voice command."
B01F48QLFA,Irves,5,had a faulty charger but had it replaced with no problems
B01F48QLFA,WPA,5,"Arrived on time and in excellent condition. I installed a separately-purchased Verizon SIM, contacted Verizon for activation assistance and was up and running less than 20 minutes later. I should also add that the battery works as though it had been replaced and the case is free from any signs of wear. Excellent value."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"I'm honestly blown away at this phone. I ordered it expecting the worst, despite the great reviews. I have had zero issues with my phone in the 2 weeks that i got it. The only thing that i questioned was the fact that i had to do 4 system updates, but once it got caught up everything was great. The phone looks and performs as if it were a brand new phone."
B01F48QLFA,DF,4,"Screen is in near excellent condition (one miniscule scratch you have to look for). Back has expected wear from a cheap case. Only real concern is whoever had this phone before obviously hadn't heard of gently plugging something in (paint scratched off in several areas around charge port area). Overall though for a refurb and less than half what I paid for this model new last year, not too shabby!"
B01F48QLFA,Michael kirby,1,"I like the phone, however I have had the screen freeze on me 3 times now. The first time a Verizon rep help me reset the phone. I have reset the phone myself the other 2 times. It took me multiple times to get it to let me in. I am worried this will keep happening. What should I do?"
B01F48QLFA,-BB,2,"I've been a Samsung user since 2012, and over the course of 6 years I've had the galaxy S3, Galaxy, S4, Note 5, and this phone (S7). I'm not sure if it's the phone's status as certified refurbished, but this is the laggiest phone with the shortest battery life of any Samsung I've ever had. I probably charge this 4x a day, using it from about 10am to 10pm. The functionality is all right, as it hasn't fully frozen yet, but even texting causes a lag. Maybe it's just the device I received, though, bc this doesn't seem to be many people's experience?"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"I have had this phone since August and had excellent performance with no problems at all. I haven't gotten is wet so for it being waterproof I cannot say but my old non-waterproof phone never got close to water either.
It came in plain undamaged packaging with not a scratch on the phone anywhere, just like brand new."
B01F48QLFA,A. Wright,5,"This was an upgrade phone for me, and I really like the phone. It has been easy to use, the battery life is wonderful (my old phone wouldn't hold a charge throughout the day anymore). The price was great, considering I was looking at phones for three-to-five hundred dollars. Very similar to my old Samsung phone, so easy to figure out some newer features."
B01F48QLFA,Kathy M.,5,"First-time used phone buyer here. I read a lot of reviews before buying a refurbished Galaxy S7. Most were negative, but I took a chance anyway. I'm only one week in on this purchase but so far, I'm very pleased. The only indications that this isn't a brand new phone are there's a bit of dust/crud in the charging port, and the after-market charger vs. a Samsung-branded charger. Otherwise, it seems to be in perfect condition. I did have to do several software updates back to back, but I don't think that's unusual."
B01F48QLFA,Howard,5,"Out of this box this phone was almost like new. Just needed to get a sim card from Diamond Wireless and everything works like new. Functionality works as expected and the S7 is great phone overall. This is a great product and even though a couple models old, performs admirably in comparison with all of the newer phones."
B01F48QLFA,danielle,5,"Worth every penny, the screen wasn't scratched, looks like brand new, I like the new features of the S7. Upgraded from an S5, such a difference"
B01F48QLFA,Lorien Butler,2,"I managed to get my old phone switched to this phone with out a problem but I believe the touch screen is not right. It randomly shows as if I'm clicking all over, send random gibberish and opens crazy apps. I tried powering down and can't touch power button since the touch screen shows as if I'm touching randomly all over the screen. It's extremely slow and glitchy where apps just start flashing and close. I can't type a text with out having to hit some spots in multiple areas and tack out letters not really typed. Last night it was at 6% battery and after sitting on my night stand charging for 2 hours was only up to 12%"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Has worked very well ever since I got it - 2 months now. A good way to save money on your phone.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"This is a much more fiscally sound purchase than a Galaxy S8 from the carrier. I had some reservations about it being refurbished and worried the the carrier would give me trouble when I got it activated, but everything has been just fine. :-)"
B01F48QLFA,Patricia,5,"I was a little concerned ordering a phone online, but it was a great experience. Arrived Timely. Looks brand new. No wear and tear at all. The battery is so much better than my Note 4. I do miss the camera on my Note 4, but still good quality pictures. I actually like the smaller size. Fits in my pants pocket and it is much easier to deal with on a daily basis."
B01F48QLFA,MasterSivers,5,"Came on time. Came in prime condition. - The phone itself is absolutely excellent. I began using it every day, it even has made my life at work far easier. It counts my steps with Samsung Health, and is helping me to stay healthier. Great choice. Great smart phone!"
B01F48QLFA,Canedo,3,"Went to Verizon for some troubleshooting and was told this device belong to another account. Even after taking the box I got it with, was told they couldn't help me. Had to buy another phone."
B01F48QLFA,Steph,2,"We received this phone with a poorly placed screen protector that had dust stuck under it. Upon peeling it up we found the screen scuffed, and the home button worn completely down and scratched. Disappointing, especially considering shipping took a week."
B01F48QLFA,Jennifer B.,5,No problems. Always look at ratings for the refurbisher you order from. My refurbished s7 has performed like new for a fraction of the cost of a new phone.
B01F48QLFA,Ash Gundelach,3,"Constantly dropped signal. Never able to call, but sometimes texts would work.
Returned it
Bought from buySPRY
They were helpful, but couldn't get me another in time so I went with someone else.
Also the thumb button was scratched.

The phone itself was awesome though! Love the photos it takes!"
B01F48QLFA,Dottie,1,"Mobilespee said phone was a Verizon wireless phone which was not. Phone would not hold a charge, would not update. Verizon representative tried to install information but phone kept shutting off so they couldn't get anything through it. Guess you never know what junk you buy it sellers are dishonest!!"
B01F48QLFA,B. L.,5,Perfect condition. Shipped with charging cord only. No manual or headphones. Works great with our Verizon service. So far so good!
B01F48QLFA,Theresa Harmless Jenkins,5,"I was skeptical ordering. Was assured it would work on Verizon. Has Verizon logo on back. Hardest part was getting a SIM card cause it is an older phone and I had to drive over an hour to a Verizon corporate store on a busy weekend. Husband loves it. Itâs his first smart phone. No complaints so far. Questions were answered quickly. Fast shipping.
Def recommend this seller and this product."
B01F48QLFA,Michael Hoenie,1,"Purchased this because the description states: ""Samsung Galaxy S7 G930v 32GB Verizon Wireless"". Verizon could NOT activate this phone because it is not a Verizon phone. Phone came in a box with only the charger and phone. Outside on the box it states ""Samsung galaxy s7 g930 32g Verizon/unlocked black"". Returning for a full refund."
B01F48QLFA,Emi,1,"It's been just over 3 months since I bought the phone, and already the charger port is finnicky and a pain. I will add, I only charge when the battery is low and never overnight. If the phone isn't held at a specific angle, it will not charge. Should have just bought the s8 from Verizon directly."
B01F48QLFA,Nathan Huber,5,The only signs of wear are the witness marks from the previous owner's case and a scratch on the home button. The button and fingerprint reader work fine. The screen is perfect. Battery seems pretty good. Processor is pretty quick. I did have to go to the Verizon store to get a nano sim card as my existing sim card didn't fit (this was free & painless). Perfect buy for those that aren't cool with spending $600+ on the newest smartphone.
B01F48QLFA,east coast reader,5,"Could see only one tiny scratch. Otherwise, the phone looks brand new. Battery life is so-so, but that might just be from adding apps and playing with the phone. In typical Samsung fashion, the screen is very sensitive to touch. Annoying, but not a big deal. I added a screen protector that seemed to help. I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks, but hopefully I'll continue to be happy with my purchase."
B01F48QLFA,pat d hatten,1,"Advertised as a G930V (verizon) what was actually delivered was a 930U... no Wi-Fi calling, no voicemail notifications (have to dial *86 to find out if you have a voicemail)"
B01F48QLFA,Just a Buyer,2,"There is something wrong with the phone, it doesn't always charge, and it when it does it doesnt always go to fast charging mode, other than that its a nice phone but i wish to have it fixed. I am definitely willing to give it a higher rate if the company can reach to me and fix it."
B01F48QLFA,Damian Mohabir,4,"received 3 different phones before the one I have right now, they have great, easy, and fast customer service, everything went fine with a few replacements. convinced the phone doesn't have a oem battery, it discharges very quick."
B01F48QLFA,Drew G.,5,"I have not had a phone in about 4 years. I was a bit trepidicious about getting a refurb. However, this one has been just great. Battery seems to need a charge at least once every 24 hours. I don't know if that is normal, but it is way better than my old beaten S4."
B01F48QLFA,JW,2,"battery life was just like my samsung 3. froze a few times within the first week. product was returned. however, company worked well with us and we'd use them again."
B01F48QLFA,mymommawearscombatboots,5,My son's Galaxy S7 screen went dead the last time he dropped it. We bought the same phone from this company and we stuck in his SIM card and SD card and its worked like a dream. Its a certified refurbished but looks and acts like brand new. It was fast shipping too! Thanks!!
B01F48QLFA,McKenzie,5,"I ordered this, came in three days, took it up to Verizon, and within half and hour I was on my way with seemingly a brand new phone. I do not see any difference between my phone, and my sisters who we bought brand new from Verizon a few years ago. It was very easy, and affordable and worked like new at Verizon. The phone itself was blank, with generic Google apps. No earbuds, but that wasn't in the description. It did come with a charger, and plastic wrapping around it. I had a really great experience, would do again."
B01F48QLFA,Dan Ahler,5,"This phone does what I need. It isn't so large it can't be put in a pocket, which is important to me. I put a Zagg screen protector on it and have it in a case and with a bit of luck it will last a couple of years. The cost to replace with a refurbished was about the same as I anticipated spending on repairs. Unfortunately, modern phones with water resistance include glues that are difficult to remove to make a repair a self-service option unless one is truly determined."
B01F48QLFA,Erlian,4,"I received mine from DealFisher a few months ago. The battery seems to hold up well and everything has been in good working order. The home button is likely aftermarket and a little ""clickier"" than it would be from a new phone, and the fingerprint scanner isn't quite as consistent with it as I'd expect (less so than it was with my S6). Overall it was very much worth it to buy refurbished."
B01F48QLFA,Fred,3,"I have friends with the same phone, and even running just the factory installed apps my battery life was terrible compared to theirs. I ended up buying a replacement oversized battery and opening up the phone and replacing it. Kind of a pain, but that's life when you buy refurbished stuff I guess."
B01F48QLFA,Kim Boyce,1,"After reading the negative reviews mixed with some positive ones, I figured it would be a gamble purchasing this refurbished phone. Well, I lost that wager. Phone went from 100% battery to 34% in 2 hours, with very limited use. Tried removing unnecessary apps, dimming the screen, and turning off the ""always on"" screen setting, but nothing helped. Ended up just purchasing a new phone from Verizon."
B01F48QLFA,Family Man,1,Buyer beware! It says Verizon Wireless but these are not Verizon Branded phones. That means no voicemail and several other key apps that can only be pre-installed by Verizon. You cannot get these apps from play store or anywhere else.
B01F48QLFA,Brandon Helfer,4,"Fantastic Battery life, works exactly as needed. Definitely worth the price of not getting the newest galaxy for 3 times the price. Only issue is it appears to run slower then my last phone (Galaxy s5) but not by a frustrating amount

Be prepared for endless updates when first starting the phone"
B01F48QLFA,mcurtis,5,"For the price this phone is awesome. Replaced my S5 that had become a complete mess. This phone is fast, long battery life and no visible wear. Also came with a real fast charger and an adapter so I could easily connect phones and transfer all my info over. Love it so far!"
B01F48QLFA,Mark M.,5,The Galaxy S7 is STILL an amazing phone - even two years after it's initial release. I bought this phone solely for the purpose of capturing 1080p and 4K video with the Osmo Mobile 2 that allows me to walk while recording and get extremely stable footage.
B01F48QLFA,Linda K.,5,Arrived quickly and exactly as promised. Works well!
B01F48QLFA,Rhonda A.,3,Refurbished and battery had a overheating problem. I found out after that refurbished phones do have this issue a lot.
B01F48QLFA,bookish,3,"Says it is Verizon phone (originally)
I took it to a verizon store to activate it and transfer my # and they couldnt get it working. They ended up buying the phone from me and giving me a deal on a galaxy s8 plus."
B01F48QLFA,matt,2,"WeDeliverWireless - phone came damaged there are small cracks in the screen and the area where you plug it in to charge has most of the paint around it scratched off, when I purchased this phone before it was from SikkSound did a great job, the phone came in a flawless condition

EDIT: The phone no longer works due to ""moisture detected"" and is unable to charge"
B01F48QLFA,John,5,Works as good as the original we bought through the VZW retailer so far (4 months). Had to call verizon and have them re-add visual voicemail because the phone didn't automatically sync when we had it synced with the old phone number (from the phone it replaced.)
B01F48QLFA,Ziggy,5,"My wife needed to upgrade her S6, but did not want or need the latest and greatest. This was the perfect solution, and half the price that Verizon wanted charge. It was easy setup and transfer from her old phone. We are happy!"
B01F48QLFA,Kindle Customer,5,"I bought the S7 refurbished to replace an older cell phone of mine. Prior to this purchase, I had only purchased new cell phones directly from Verizon, so I was nervous. Well, the phone worked so well and was so easy to set up that I came back and purchased a second one for another family member. The first one shipped from BuySRRY and the second one from Kiss Electronics, but it did not make a difference as both were identical, quality products."
B01F48QLFA,BunnyGrrrl,4,It's holding up okay so far. Brought it to a Verizon shop and got it set up easily. Two complaints about the S7: the charge port still sucks (cords don't fit/ break and probs with moisture getting in) and no memory card.
B01F48QLFA,Joel J Gonzales,3,"The banner says I purchased this . However I returned it because the micro usb charging slot held the usb loosely so did not charge consistently in the car or any situation that moved. Wireless charging was ok but I did not want to rely soley on wireless charging. Otherwise, the phone itself worked fine."
B01F48QLFA,D Show,1,"Our second mistake. We purchased this phone after making things mistake once before. We purchased from another amazon seller hoping for a more successful experience. Again, the phone came with an AT&T symbol on the back. Uh oh. This phone was more dinged up and in worse condition than the first phone we purchased. We took the phone to a Verizon store to put on our plan. It didn't work. The phone will not work on a Verizon line. They tried to help us sincerely, but to no success."
B01F48QLFA,Chuck,5,"Like this phone! Looks brand new. All functions and battery life are great. Was initially concerned with buying a refurbished phone, I couldn't be happier. Mine came from Cell Surfers for a very reasonable price."
B01F48QLFA,Tristan R. Kovatis,5,Been using this for awhile and have no regrets getting the refurbished. LESS than half the cost of a Verizon replacement and has worked flawlessly for quite awhile.
B01F48QLFA,Miss Tish,5,I received this phone as an upgrade to my old Samsung S5. I am so pleased with the build and quality of this phone - it has all the features I need plus more that I don't. ;) I mainly use it for texting and checking my social media. Camera has some great features and pictures are great. I'm super happy I have this new phone! For being a re-conditioned phone there was not a mark on it - it looks brand new.
B01F48QLFA,Nathan,5,So fare so good! I'll report back after a year if I have any problems.
B01F48QLFA,Hikeaz,5,"Looks and functions like new, at a fraction of the cost from Verizon. And I don't see any issues with the battery life either. My colleagues who seem inclined to empty their wallets for the sheer joy of spending on gadgets have sheepishly started asking me for the Amazon link for this."
B01F48QLFA,Bob M,4,Big improvement over older Samsung phones. Refurbished or not it works and looks new.
B01F48QLFA,Terry N.,2,"Fully charged the phone prior to use. Less than 4 hours later phone was down to 15%. Eighth continued use seems to be losing 20% every hour on the optimized battery setting.

The phone took 4 updates in order to work properly. I'm not sure if that is common but I've not experienced it with other refurbished phones."
B01F48QLFA,Matthew Schweiger,5,"Product arrived in great condition. Some scuff marks around the micro USB port, but they were almost unnoticible. Other than that its looks like a brand new phone.
I upgraded from a note 3, so I did have to change my sim card to a smaller format, so if your replacing an older phone just something to be aware of. Verizon changed my sim card for free, so wasn't an issue.
At first felt tiny compared to the note 3, but I adjusted in few days. I am happy with my purchase."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,I took a chants and it paid off. My Phone was like bran new and worked like bran new. I read most of the reviews before I ordered.
B01F48QLFA,Waggamama,5,I could not be happier with this product. It was the perfect replacement for a phone that I really liked but accidently destroyed. It was delivered quickly and I had no problem quickly and easily transferring from my old phone to this one. It is continues to consistently perform very well.
B01F48QLFA,Chris Lynch,1,"Phone was in good condition, sim card wouldn't read the Verizon card so it was useless"
B01F48QLFA,MG,4,"Received a G930U instead of the G930v advertised. Was able to make it work, but not what I wanted."
B01F48QLFA,Janelle Evans,5,"The phone was exactly as described, maybe even better. There wasn't a scratch anywhere. The phone has been working with no issues not for more than 2 weeks."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,"the phone won't turn on straight out of the package, it goes to galaxy s7 when attached to a charger and at no other time, then cuts back off. don't know who to talk too, because I removed the back to check if any parts were missing and the back plate cracked during removal, not sure if I can still return it or not. Not even sure who I should direct my questions too."
B01F48QLFA,Aaron L waller,5,"This is one of the best Samsung phones to date. I have had multiple galaxy phones over the years and this was a jump from the S5 to the S7. Multiple screen ability, great battery life, wireless charging and ease of use make it my favorite phone so far."
B01F48QLFA,Carol B.,5,"Got this for my husband, after all the problems HE has with cell's, he likes this one!
Fast shipping, just as described and in minutes it was running on our Verizon!"
B01F48QLFA,Chris Jones,2,"The phone i bought had some issues with it, but once I got a new one sent to me it had all the issues fixed. May be best to go with a different phone rather than struggle with the issues I had too. (Battery drain quickly, late shipping, low quality screen - burned in images)

The new one works fine but the process was a struggle.

Something to keep in mind is that the phone likely won't have a warranty on it from Samsung so good luck!"
B01F48QLFA,Lovebug2720,5,exactly what we were after works perfectly
B01F48QLFA,Alyssa Kloostra,5,Been using this phone for over a year now and it works great. When i first got it there was some deep scratches on the home button but other than that one cosmetic flaw everything works great and ive had no issues!!!
B01F48QLFA,Tasteefreeze,1,Tried to activate my phone with Verizon but it turns out that the device was on a list of lost or stolen phones and therefore was not eligible to be activated. In the few minutes that I did have the phone on and running the battery become increasingly hot.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Arived faster than expected, in pristine condition. There was no sim caddy ejection tool, but a paper clip works just as well. This phone cam with factory released firmare and had to go through a dozen update cycles one after the other to get up to oreo with the december security release, so be patient and keep applying the updates, it is NOT in an infinite loop."
B01F48QLFA,From the couch.,3,Had to return at my cost for $12.50. Phone rebooted constantly. No trouble shooting would correct problem. Research suggest its operating system hardware problem. Maybe cannot be detected on standard precertified protocol checks. Vendor accepted return but I had to pay postage. Got replacement phone from same vendor but used Prime this time. Very satisfied with new phone. .
B01F48QLFA,Sean Higgins,5,I was a bit aprehensive ordering a refurbished phone sight unseen but I have to say it was everything described and a bit more.
B01F48QLFA,Lindley,4,Very happy with the phone at this point for what i payed for it. The battery life does suck but not a bad phone over all.
B01F48QLFA,Rob,5,"Appears almost new! Battery duration isn't as long as my old phone, but still loving this phone."
B01F48QLFA,chris gaturu,1,I loved the phone but it didn't make it a year before I had too spend to fix it. I've been having issues since including overheating to the point it burns. avoid the seller.
B01F48QLFA,Jacque S.,5,"Bought 2 for my wife and I. We're with MetroPCS and I switched the sim card into this phone and followed the instructions that came on a card with the phones. It didn't work at first, so I went to the MetroPCS store and they sold me 2 new sim cards and they both started working just fine. Called to activate and they both work great. These were Verizon branded phones, so we had to disable some built in software, but no big deal."
B01F48QLFA,rapunzal,3,Rec'd samsung s7 ...refurbished. .everything so far seems fine with the exception of speaker phone. Big disappointment. ..have had it less than 30 days so can't speak to the longevity yet. 3 stars only b\cuz of speakerphone.
B01F48QLFA,John,2,"Everything else considered, this was a good buy. However, one fatal flaw right from the beginning when I first turned it on, I immediately noticed there was screen burn in. It was faint, but it is definitely noticeable"
B01F48QLFA,Kyle Arsenault,3,Phone seems to be in near perfect condition but I received a 4gb phone instead of 32 gb
B01F48QLFA,Kenny,3,Was not clear that you wont get all tools needed to install sim card and mirco card. Also not loaded up like phone you get from verizon. Phone itself works great but need to load up some features that come with the one that you buy from Verizon
B01F48QLFA,PjosO,5,"For me I love this size phone, Goldy Locks...just right. Best Sam phone in the last 5 years, bar none. Battery life could be better but it meets my needs."
B01F48QLFA,Wendy Carlson,5,I'm always leery buying something used that's electronic. I was not disappointed. The phone looks like new and works great.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,Received a bad battery. The top of screen was cracked. Very disappointed that these are the standards allowed on amazon.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,I will literally spend 7 hours of my day trying to get my phone to 100%. I then use my phone for 30 minutes and I'm already back down to 40%. Total crap.
B01F48QLFA,Sara Livingston,4,"So far so good. Phone seems to work well.
Battery seems to be very warm after little usage. Disappointed there were stickers on the back and the SIM card key was not included but that is the risk with refurbished. Phone appearance is perfect otherwise so far."
B01F48QLFA,MESLER16,3,"The phone showed up in good condition very slight signs of wear, I think the whole refurbished thing might be a bit of a joke but it does carry a good guarantee and is an easy return to Amazon if you are not satisfied. The battery on mine was a little week unfortunately but it will do"
B01F48QLFA,hoss13,3,"I like the phone, good battery, quick to charge, my only issue is that the screen that was put into this refurbished device has screen burn in."
B01F48QLFA,alexander crosby,1,Battery life on this phone isn't even close to 80% of original. Constantly having to charge it with light use.
B01F48QLFA,Jessie,5,I received the phone on time and it was as advertised. I'm usually skeptical of refurbished phone batteries but I have had no problems.
B01F48QLFA,Tom,1,Had to return as phone was not working. Tech support started out helpful then I was bounced around between several different people and became a mess. Phone would not register letters properly when typed so couldn't access the phone.
B01F48QLFA,Phils Stuff,5,Worked fine on the Verizon network after I installed my Sim card. Also it appeared to be in perfect condition with no scratches or blemishes.
B01F48QLFA,Njoroge,5,"I havenât had to use tech support yet, but the phone has been great! No signs of damage. A tiny bit of wear around the charging port but that it all. The battery has a great amount of life left in it. I can easily go a whole day with vigorous use and still have power left."
B01F48QLFA,ERNESTO GARDUNO,5,I bought this phone as a gift for someone in Mexico and the phone works very well. It has a small cosmetic damage in the corner (nothing to worry). The phone came in a generic box without headphones but still I am satisfied with the purchase.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,The phone's as expected but the experience was surprisingly pleasant. No complaints here.
B01F48QLFA,Nathaniel,4,"(This is my second S7 I have owned) Phone looks good, battery charges, stays cool, but doesn't seem to have the longevity as my other s7 phone. The charge cable appeared to be a Samsung OEM, charger was Not OEM, but quick charge capable. Got a chuckle with my ""return information card"" was for How to return my refurb Apple device and the steps to remove personal information."
B01F48QLFA,Dan Espich,5,"Very impressed for a refurbished phone, basically impossible to tell it was not a brand new phone. Works fine."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,3,"Charging area is scratched up, Facebook app image is burnt into the screen, It looks like they tried to pull the back of the phone off. It works, and that's what I needed, but I'm going to toss it and buy a new phone the moment I'm able to since this one is in such poor condition."
B01F48QLFA,Bobby Banks,5,"I was extremely sceptical about buying a refurbished phone. After buying 2 refurbished Samsunge GalexyS7 for my husband and I, we will never buy brand new phones again. They works just as good as a new phone and we have had no issues. I have had this phone for 2 months and have dropped it multiple times and it still works perfect. Definately glad I took a chance on buying these phone. I love it!"
B01F48QLFA,Happy customer,5,Just like all the other reviews say. Great battery life and very fast. Has a lot of other conveniences my s5 didnt
B01F48QLFA,James,4,"Looks good and works, didn't get the ear buds other people got but also didn't expect them. Came with a fast charger branded by Samsung. Would give 5 stars but they actually called me and asked to leave a review while I was at work."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Perfect working order. Minus a small blemish on the back of the phone, which doesn't effect its operation in any way, this product is flawless."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,"I bought this phone for my 11 year old son after buying a reburbished Google pixel from another website that we ended up returning because we couldn't get wifi to work on it. I am very pleased with this phone. It's a great phone for a middle school boy. The price was right, it shipped fast and the battery stays charged for a long time as well."
B01F48QLFA,Mark S. Wittenberg,5,I received my Samsung Galaxy S7 in a timely manner. It was spotless except for a few minor scratches on the bottom button which shouldn't be anything that effects functionality. Installed my SIM card and I'm up and running smoothly.
B01F48QLFA,Robert P Frantz,1,"Verizon tech could not get the phone to activate, tried 2 new sims. In the return-exchange process now."
B01F48QLFA,SimplySpirited,3,Scratched to pieces on screen and the back as well as the charger port and I think something is wrong with the port....
B01F48QLFA,Jennifer,1,"My phone started giving me problems right before the warranty ran out. I sent it in and they fixed it. However, once I got the phone back, there was a brand new problem which they refused to fix because by that time my warranty had run out. I sent several emails and finally requested to be contacted by a supervisor, which never happened. Would not buy from them again."
B01F48QLFA,Joseph,4,"Most of the phone was in new condition, however the metal bezel around the rear camera, the glass in front of the flash, and the home button were all scratched. So far works well."
B01F48QLFA,WhineLover,5,Both phones showed up on time and have been excellent. The extra shatter proof glass they provided for free was a nice bonus
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,Useless without the pin tool to open the sim card port. Seriously people. How do you forget that!
B01F48QLFA,Enoch Foster,2,"I like this phone very much. However the refurbished model I bought has a short battery life, does not get me through a day. Also, the phone was sitting in my car no one touching it and I look down and suddenly it had a crack across the front screen. :/ :("
B01F48QLFA,Darrel Durbin,5,"Good deal, solid refurb"
B01F48QLFA,Mr. Smith,5,Exactly as described. Working perfectly.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,"Received the phone, looks good, but when went to activate it, i was informed by verizon that the phone wasn't paid off by the previous owner, is on a nonpay list, and can't be activated it.
I have contacted the seller, and will update when I hear back from them."
B01F48QLFA,David Fraser,1,"Piece of junk phone. Many issues, keeps randomly shutting down...buy from somewhere else.."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,The phone has terrible burn-in pixels on every screen. Without a replacement I would never recommend this to anyone.
B01F48QLFA,cjblassneck,1,"I bought a ""certified"" Samsung S& from Sikksound for $327.00. After 3 months, the battery swelled and rendered the phone unuseable. Sikksound did not offer a replacement or a refund even though the device was defective. The were completely unhelpful."
B01F48QLFA,John,2,"The phone is absolutely stupendous. I had no complaints with it. However, after the 3 month warranty from DealFisher was up, not even a week afterwards, the phone turned off while I was asleep, the phone on the charger, and never turned on again. It only heats up when plugged into the charger. Right after the warranty was up... Meh. Very disappointed in this."
B01F48QLFA,Ola Beavz,5,Totally as expected. No complaints. Good job Samsung.
B01F48QLFA,Logan,5,Great condistikn
B01F48QLFA,justin w. holmes,5,"We have only had our new phone for a few weeks, but up until this point we are happy with the purchase. Super fast shipping was appreciated."
B01F48QLFA,Kyle Fellows,3,"Should have been able tip use with my carrier, but it only works with Verizon. Slightly disappointed as I don't like Verizon!"
B01F48QLFA,Brigido,5,"Great phone, not an S9 but great. You can get the Oreo update for it now too."
B01F48QLFA,Jacob Pike,4,This my only phone now and it has been working perfectly.
B01F48QLFA,chris,5,Been using it for about 4 months first month it wanted to update 10+ times a day I guess it caught up with where it needed to be. Overall it's a working phone
B01F48QLFA,Ryan,4,"I've had this phone for ~5 months now and the battery is definitely showing its age (day 1, default setting- overnight- ie not using it all: 13% drain over 12 hours. As of this writing, 27% drain over 12 hours). But other than that, everything was in perfect condition."
B01F48QLFA,Amber Katya Anderson,2,"The camera, the whole reason I bought this phone, stopped working right after the return period ended. I've had this phone just a few months and already need to replace it. Not stoked."
B01F48QLFA,Keeping a look out,2,Want to be able to switch carriers att T-Mobile etc. this is no a good phone for that. The CDMA setting does not work on other networks. Good mostly on Verizon. Donât buy to switch to anyone else. Unlocked does not matter
B01F48QLFA,sstall,5,Arrive in great shape and works great!
B01F48QLFA,Eidly Moreira,4,Phone came in good condition. Has a crack on the bottom part of the back camera. But that doesn't affect the phone at all and it doesn't affect the water resistancy on the camera. So far I'm pretty happy with it. But I'll need time to adjust to the size and button placement differences. (Previously had a moto g6)
B01F48QLFA,Kerry Martin,5,"Phone is working great, and I have it activated with Verizon."
B01F48QLFA,Dave,5,Was a gift and looks and works excellent
B01F48QLFA,idamouse,1,Phone wouldn't connect with network so sent back.
B01F48QLFA,Oliver G.,2,"Overall, the phone is nice and has some good features. However, when it arrived, The screen was scratched and the back had some marks on it too. The battery life is good (lasts about a full day)."
B01F48QLFA,Donna,5,My daughter ordered this. Typical cell phone.
B01F48QLFA,David B,5,"Sleek, relatively cheap. Came like new. Can't even tell its a used phone."
B01F48QLFA,NDA123953,2,"Bought certified refurbished S7. Battery life out of the box is terrible. Standby battery life was 8 hours in normal mode. Power Saving mode was a little better, but still not good enough to be any way equivalent to a new phone. Phone is supposed to have 12 days of standby time and 27 hours of usage time."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Works great, thus far, downside is the good ole Verizon bloatware is almost astounding, but getting it set up on Ting was a piece of cake and performance is perfect once I disabled all the bloat."
B01F48QLFA,Veronica Printup,5,"Very happy, battery life would be better."
B01F48QLFA,Rob D,5,It looks and works like a new phone. Much better than spending $1000.00 for a new phone.
B01F48QLFA,Sandy,5,Works perfectly and exactly as it was advertised. Great phone. Great site to deal with!
B01F48QLFA,jkeen,1,"I bought 2 of these, both had horrible battery life. Didn't realize just how bad it was until I replaced the first one with a new one. Just by new!"
B01F48QLFA,Bob,5,Great phone.
B01F48QLFA,MatteBlack&Chrome,3,"Pros: Phone came well packaged and in perfect condition. Works great in terms of functionality, not disappointed in the Samsung S series yet.
Cons: Battery life very bad. Gets hot when downloading, loses 10-15% of battery in an hour under normal use...e.g. calling, whatsapp, some browsing. Thinking of returning."
B01F48QLFA,Jeffery Holland,5,This Samsung galaxy s7 is great. Everything works fine.I had a s5 before I bought this so I am familiar with the workings. This is a nice upgrade to my s5. I'm happy with it.
B01F48QLFA,Sean MacMillan,2,"Despite receiving the phone with cracks in the top left corner, the phone was operational. Would have returned if her other phone had not stopped working. Feel like I paid too much for a cracked phone."
B01F48QLFA,A. Meehan,3,NOT compatible with Verizon as advertised!!!!! Disappointed. Be warned it may not work.
B01F48QLFA,jonathan cairns,3,I am revising an earlier 1 star review to 3. I thought there was glue residue near the charging port but it's just all scratched up by the previous owner putting charging cable in carelessly. I'm a little disappointed but ok due to the good price on the phone and really fast shipment.
B01F48QLFA,Kristi Kuick,1,"the description says it's a Verizon phone, but the one I received was AT&T and would not work at Verizon. They told me that after I went to get it set up at my closest Verizon store, so I had to pay return shipping, and am now waiting for a refund, and need to begin the search for an actual Verizon compatible phone all over again!"
B01F48QLFA,LB,1,Battery was bad so much for a refurbished unit......would only last 2- 21/2 hrs....luv the phone.....but the supplier is not so good. I received the phone today....3 hrs charging and the setup with verizon.....I am trying another unit from a different supplier......we shall see
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"This refurbished phone is like new! Also, I really like the phone! I've had for a few months and it hasn't failed yet. :)"
B01F48QLFA,L Goot,5,I purchased this phone for my daughter. It came in great condition with no blemishes or scratches and it started right up. We took it to Verizon and in a matter of moments had a new sim card and she was up and running. So far so good.
B01F48QLFA,Jim Chavez,5,"Easy to setup, packaged great looked great exactly what I expected"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Great deal. Phone looked like new and a really nice phone. Don't think I could beat the price and quality. Appreciate they stated the phone is for Verizon and after Verizon added the sim, worked great. Got the Spigen case for it. Just love the phone and case."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,"Phone was bought to replace my galaxy s5. So far, so good. The only concern is the embedded battery, which is fine for now."
B01F48QLFA,Bill Toomey,5,"Appears new, came with genuine Samsung Fast Charger. Arrived when expected. Beautiful and fast. Really like Nougat. Saved a ton of money."
B01F48QLFA,Tom,4,Small dent in upper right corner. Samsung S7
B01F48QLFA,david watson,1,"The worst phone ive ever had, keyboard is almost impossible to use. Most text require sending twice..crashes when i take pictures, takes hours to charge."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Bought for my 11 y.o. son. He was able to operate it straight out of the box and has had no issues since.
B01F48QLFA,Rkreykes1,5,Great phone for the money.
B01F48QLFA,Ed Campbell,5,"Mine works years later, SIX STARS"
B01F48QLFA,LukeinTennessee,5,Works like new!
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Great item
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Phone looks brand new and works like new,
Great value"
B01F48QLFA,Steve D.,5,no damage to the phone work well for 3 day and the screen went black hear sound have blue led light but no screen display i call the 1800 number grate customer serves sending me a return box
B01F48QLFA,martin reyna,5,great phone
B01F48QLFA,Reader One,5,Like new and I love it. Such a good price vs new.
B01F48QLFA,Jessi havens,1,"I am so disappointed. Well just mad. Amazon should be ashamed to sale this garbage.
I purchased this phone to replace my phone. I took it into version and it will not read the SIM card. He told me it definitely is not a Verizon phone. I was so mad I just trained it in for a new phone."
B01F48QLFA,David R. Labarre,5,Looks and works like new. Love it. 2 generations behind saves big bucks!!
B01F48QLFA,vortigar,1,"I can only say that I felt robbed on this purchase when I took this phone in to get a SIM card from Verizon I was informed that the IMEI number was flagged, it was either stolen or the account was being held for non-payment. Subsequently the following IMEI number cannot be connected."
B01F48QLFA,sher,1,"This phone was rooted. It worked for a few days, but It got hot to the touch, the OS update kept failing. Finally it locked up and would not boot. I had to return it. Thanks for Amazon."
B01F48QLFA,Only One,3,The only thing I am very disappointed in is that for some reason the HD Video and Voice calling was disabled on the back end of the phone and I cannot access the internet while I am on a phone call. VERY FRUSTRATING!!
B01F48QLFA,Davidboatnerjr,1,"My Samsung 7 arrived defective. The speaker is busted, nothing but static noise. Very disappointed"
B01F48QLFA,Mario,5,"So Far So Good, the wife loves it!"
B01F48QLFA,pukkamaru,5,Everything work perfect ....... very happy with phone !
B01F48QLFA,Gabriel P Hobson,1,"Per Verizon rep: ""phone is coming up on a suspended status for a contract account. In this case it is possible that the vendor received this phone from a person that did not fulfilled their contract."" Nope! Avoid it."
B01F48QLFA,N. MacDonald,4,The unit battery for not hold up all day.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,Nice updates to the 6. Battery life still a nuisance.
B01F48QLFA,d c,4,"Battery life could be better, removable battery would be best"
B01F48QLFA,Jack,5,Decided to try reconditioned phone. Turn out to be excellent choice. Very hard to tell it isn't new. Highly recommend.
B01F48QLFA,David C,5,Best bang for your buck rn.... especially after the S9 just hit the market!
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,"This phone has no problem with connectivity inside metal structures where my co-workers have difficulty with reception and dropped calls. Also, I'm experiencing improved Wifi reception over my previous phone!"
B01F48QLFA,judy higgins,1,Lasted 4 months

B01F48QLFA,bill redick,3,returned didn't need
B01F48QLFA,411011,5,Thanks. Looks basically new.
B01F48QLFA,MH,5,The product arrived quickly and was exactly as the seller described. It's a great upgrade from an S5.
B01F48QLFA,Ryan Saunders,5,"The phone I received worked almost perfectly and was in very good shape. There was an issue with the fingerprint scanner which I've yet to fix (if it can even be fixed), but that's the only issue I've come upon. Otherwise, it's fully functional and more than worth the price."
B01F48QLFA,-,5,"Really happy with this phone. I was a bit nervous about buying refurbished, but the phone is in pristine condition and working perfectly. I would definitely buy from this company again. Thanks a lot!"
B01F48QLFA,Reece,1,Was not as described!!! Phone is not unlocked!!! I have called the company over 3 times and they never answer or return my call after leaving several voicemails!!!
B01F48QLFA,Gabriel,1,"The battery life is terrible on this phone, i only got 3 hours per charge. Terrible waste of money."
B01F48QLFA,brandon nyquist,1,Very disappointed with this phone. Battery life is very poor. I doubt this phone will make in more than a month.
B01F48QLFA,Gaia,1,Save your money. Camera jacked up and can't play back recording. Reduced to overpriced paper weight.
B01F48QLFA,Phyllis DeGioia,5,"The S6 I had was bad all around, but I love the S7."
B01F48QLFA,Ritesh Kanjee,5,Feels like a brand new Galaxy S7 even though it is refurbished.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Great exactly what I expected, works awesome!"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Better than the s7 Edge. At least you can find a protective case that works on this one. With the edge...the edge is unprotected and it broke when I dropped it on the edge
B01F48QLFA,killabug,5,Love the phone. Recieved on time
B01F48QLFA,Zeno W St Cyr II,5,Very nice phone!

B01F48QLFA,melvmck,5,Looks and perform brand new so far!
B01F48QLFA,Breanna Lockett,1,I give this phone no stars. My boyfriend couldnât connect his phone to Verizon because it was on Verizonâs blacklist as a stolen phone. Now his line is disconnected and we have to get a hold of amazon to get a refund and he doesnât have a phone! Ugh.
B01F48QLFA,Jacky L.,1,Couldn't use the phone at all because it can't recognize a sim card
B01F48QLFA,Becky Thomas,5,"Works great, liking it so far."
B01F48QLFA,melissa,1,"It came before the actual due date, which that was great! Unfortunately when I activated the phone, it would constantly restart itself. Tried rebooting it. Still was restarting, the firm ware is damaged."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,It took a lot of time but we got it to work with cricket. Great phone!
B01F48QLFA,BACbKA nynKuH,5,It works.
B01F48QLFA,Rachael Barlow,5,"Love this phone. I switched from apple and I'm a Samsung person now. The phone works great- no problems at all. I bought my husband one shortly after I got mine, and they are excellent phones. Very happy!!"

B01F48QLFA,Stanford,5,"Great phone, but the charger was fake, won t charge my phone..."
B01F48QLFA,Jenetta Doe,1,"Microphone doesn't work. When I researched, I found that is a common problem."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Arrived as promised, was in excellent condition; came with charger. This phone works great and was easy to activate with a Verizon Sim Card"
B01F48QLFA,Lynsie,1,"I received the phone. It would not charge, and ran really slow. Very disappointed."

B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Love my new Galaxy S7 but most of all I love the camera in the quality of pictures it takes and that's the reason I bought it the shipping was fast got it in 2 days with no problems easy to set up with no problems
B01F48QLFA,Miguel A. Garcia Miranda,5,I love the phone I think the battery life is short but I think is for some of my configuration but in conclusion excellent phone and in the time expected ^_^
B01F48QLFA,David Yoder,4,"Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone! Not the latest galaxy by any means, but much better than the s4 I replaced it with."
B01F48QLFA,Cricket,5,easy to use love it
B01F48QLFA,Rhingoshop,1,"Bought this phone MAY 18...it is now August 1st...the Phone no longer works, you can open the screen but cannot get to the homepage. They do not offer warranty so there goes $200+ right in the trash."
B01F48QLFA,Steve E. Curd,5,"Looks and works as a brand new phone, at half the price. Activated immediately on Verizon, and works exactly as it should."
B01F48QLFA,SPC Harvey,1,This phone is not unlocked! It is only allowing Verizon sim cards not any other carrier.
B01F48QLFA,Joseph Bailey,5,"After I let it sit and charge for a little while, the phone has worked PERFECT after. After a close ans detailed inspection, there is absolutely no damage anywhere. The phone is fast, sleek, and is just like a brand new phone."
B01F48QLFA,AmyLea,5,Got this phone to replace my son's Samsung S5 and it's perfect!!!! Would never know it's a refurbished phone. Thanks!
B01F48QLFA,Eowyn Cassavaugh,5,"Great Phone ordered from Dealfish, would only order from them best on reviews. I was glad I did. Looked brand new!!"

B01F48QLFA,Melissa Calhoon,4,Nice phone. Has cool features and a nice display. Perfect screen no scratches.
B01F48QLFA,Jeff Roberts,5,Meow
B01F48QLFA,Cesar h.,4,Phone is a technical marvel. So far the only issue with it is the battery life. Literally see the battery drain by the minute. Maybe since it's refurbished the battery is older than expected. Don't Know.
B01F48QLFA,Gonzalo H.,3,Battery life is kinda bad. Has some scratches on the corners and a big scratch on the fingerprint sensor. But overall works good and the camera too.
B01F48QLFA,jason meyer,1,Did not download Verizon voice mail app
B01F48QLFA,Jose,5,Cool
B01F48QLFA,Dan T.,5,"I received the phone in like new condition, no problems with it whatsoever. I upgraded from an S5, so far very happy with the decision!"
B01F48QLFA,Angie Taylor,5,This was a replacement for a previous Samsung and appears to be just fine. So far so good!
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,Arrived in time. Activated without issue. Audio sounds tinny compared with working unit not refurbished. Good price.
B01F48QLFA,Bob Millie,1,Screen stopped working after 45 days
B01F48QLFA,Logan D.,5,Perfect
B01F48QLFA,christina b. johnson,5,Purchased for my mom and she LOVES this phone. Great buy for the money and no defects.
B01F48QLFA,Islandgirl,1,This phone is not unlock!!
B01F48QLFA,Tyler Sandmeyer,5,This phone although not being up to date is a great phone. The battery life is long and the phone functions impeccably.
B01F48QLFA,Kevin,5,It is like brand new !
B01F48QLFA,Ofek Harary,5,"Excellent phone, couldn't tell it was refurbished. International shipping was a great bonus, already bought another one :)"
B01F48QLFA,Frank,5,The phone arrived in perfect condition. I am so glad I bought it. My very first smartphone. I knew that the battery would need to be replaced.
B01F48QLFA,brandon,5,Works
B01F48QLFA,Charles Norton,5,Very happy with my purchase. Speedy delivery. No hitches with start up. Everything worked as expected. Friendly personnel at Kiss Electronics and easy to deal with.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,3,The phone seems to have a problem with the speaker phone and the charger is not compatible with the phone.
B01F48QLFA,alexander lee schmidt,2,"Message and email notifications don't work. The phone keeps downloading an update, but won't complete the install, bad buy."
B01F48QLFA,Andrew Henderson,4,"The phone arrived on time, works really well so far, and looks like new. I am very happy with it. The only problem is that it came with an iPhone charger instead of the correct charger."
B01F48QLFA,Dylan Gunning,5,Everything is working well and my transfer of data and sim card was easy from my Galaxy S6.
B01F48QLFA,Matthew,5,This is the most worth it phone out right now.
B01F48QLFA,Emily Moon,5,Great phone and in nice shape!
B01F48QLFA,Jacob B.,5,"Phone arrived in its packaged, covered in bubble wrap, with its charger and cable. Other than the most superficial, invisible scratch on this screen, the phone is virtually in perfect condition. Refurbished items are just getting better and better these days."
B01F48QLFA,corey holton,1,Do not buy this phone from tech venture they are not Verizon phones and canât be activated.... such a waste of time
B01F48QLFA,Kenny,2,Bought this phone in the description that says it was an unlocked phone turned it on starter to use it would not let me use it because it says it is Verizon Wireless only
B01F48QLFA,Tom Bynum,4,Great service. Fast Delivery! Phone works great. Highly recommended.
B01F48QLFA,John,5,"I bought this phone since I broke my ipad badly. The phone looks like brand new works very well but the battery life is not that good. However, overall, i really satisfied with this."
B01F48QLFA,ZahnZahn,4,"Shipping took 8 days, not sure if that is normal but definitely a first world problem. I have used this for two days and so far a 5 star. The first day it had to do updates 7 times before I could use it much. Not sure what version it started with but is now up to 7.0. When I took it into Verizon to get a SIM card they said the serial number says this phone is gold, which it is not, it is black. And when I registered the device with Samsung it also shows a gold phone.
Finger print reader is very quick and effective. Samsung pay is great and quick to checkout with.
Phone is fast and battery life seems good.
I'll update the review in a few days and weeks and let you all know how it is holding up.
-------
I have now used the S7 for almost 2 months. The only item I will complain about is the speaker phone when on a phone call. I can hear the other party great, but they have very bad feed back and tell me to turn off speaker phone. I attempted some troubleshooting myself and then ended up calling Samsung. An hour on the phone with them and doing all sorts of weird phone restarts, cache clearing and safe mode tests, there is still no answer as to why the speaker phone does not work. Is it a physical issue or software issue? Not a clue and Samsung wants me to factory reset the phone as the next step but I am not sure I want to do that yet.
The camera is great. Phone is quick with all applications and the battery lasts all day long. If you use the always on screen setting to show the time that kills the battery by at least 4 hours quicker so I don't use that anymore.
Because of the speakerphone issue I will knock this review down to a 4 star from a 5 star."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,Terrible should've never bought this piece of junk. It's done nothing but glitch since I got it. Never buying a refurbished phone again.
B01F48QLFA,Randy,1,Screen quit on last day of eligible return. Close call but got full refund.
B01F48QLFA,Pablo Cesar Gonzalez,3,Normal
B01F48QLFA,Review Name,2,I have the international version of the S7 for a non-Verizon line and it works fine. I tried this Verizon version of the phone for a Verizon line and it had a problem unlocking from the home screen. Three times it just wouldn't unlock and I had to do a complete system wipe and reboot. I picked up a second Verizon version of the phone from a big box store and after a few days of use it too became stuck in an endless loop when I tried to unlock it. I am starting to think the Verizon version of this phone has some issue with unlocking.
B01F48QLFA,Prince Habiboo,4,"Overall, this phone does what it needs to!

Performs better than average across the spectrum. Not the end all be all phone, but good enough to last a couple years!"
B01F48QLFA,Jon porciello,3,My phone worked great for about 6 months until 2 days ago it turned off and never turned back on again. So i then had to purchase a new phone due to it breaking out of nowhere
B01F48QLFA,Robert Hicks,4,Grate
B01F48QLFA,Suepetersonjessipeterson,4,The performance was as if brand new. The screen had a small dead spot when the brightness was low. I sent it in and got another one from buyspry instead. This one is perfect.
B01F48QLFA,DME,5,"Product and quality was exactly as advertised. Phone is like new and works perfectly. This is a great option for someone who wants a quality phone but for whom the latest generation ""new"" phone is not a must - have."
B01F48QLFA,Sandy Kohfeldt,1,"Ended up taking phone into Verzion to set up and we were told that even with a verizon sim card, we were not able to use the phone on verizon network."
B01F48QLFA,Bruce C,5,"Like new, love it!"
B01F48QLFA,Antonio E Rocha,5,"We have one of these so we knew what to expect. This is a replacement for a Galaxy S5 that was lost. Now our phones can use the same charger, etc."
B01F48QLFA,TOM TUCK,5,was everything advertised.
B01F48QLFA,Austin is awesome,3,I ordered a black phone for my son and received a rose gold phone. The phone is working good but my son definitely wasn't happy with the color.
B01F48QLFA,David Hernandez,4,Bought as a present for my sister she no longer annoys me
B01F48QLFA,NinjaPotato,4,"Arrived early, thank you. Back plastic has crack in it. Still works. Son doesn't want to give it up to wait for return/exchange hassles."
B01F48QLFA,Carl Sheldon wants Help,3,The ONLY thing that I didn't like about the phone was that it was NOT COMPATIBLE with my Boost network and it have to be sent back.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,Cell phone worked and looked like new devise. I am happy with my purchase!
B01F48QLFA,Cathy Artist,4,"I am new to this phone, but have found it very easy to navigate."
B01F48QLFA,Evan hughes,5,"This phone works fantastically, battery life is decent, and the phone is quite fast. The speaker on the Galaxy S7 is not as loud as the S6 but still works okay."
B01F48QLFA,anna s,1,this phone does not work with the Verizon network
B01F48QLFA,Ian Hanschke,4,"Great device, it only seems to run short on the baterie duration. For the rest, its a great device."
B01F48QLFA,Michelle Tackitt,5,The phone seems to be great so far! This seller has contacted me to make sure everything is going well with the phone. I am a happy customer so far!
B01F48QLFA,Jack C Nieborsky,5,"A+, would buy again. Only had small indications of previous use."
B01F48QLFA,renee holloway,5,great phone! no problems ! works just like new!
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,"Despite clearly stating that this was for use on Verizon, the phone arrived set up for Tmobile. Useless and waste of my time."
B01F48QLFA,Matt,4,"Works well, battery could've been swapped tho"
B01F48QLFA,hotelec,5,Good used phone
B01F48QLFA,Jenn,5,Perfect
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,Just missing the tool to access sim card.
B01F48QLFA,Andres Berrios del Solar,1,"El telÃ©fono no viene desbloqueado....lo considero in engaÃ±o.
Solo permite SIM de Verizone"
B01F48QLFA,Laura T.,5,Received quickly and it works like new
B01F48QLFA,jake,3,Phone has a small crack on the back glass. And a small chip on the edge of the front screen. Other than that it functions properly
B01F48QLFA,Dr Jay,5,"Was leery of buying given the horror stories of vendors with Amazon. Happy to report, no problems (yet) after several weeks. Verizon mailed me a free SIM card (no need to buy one) and I installed a 64 GB ram card along side it for a few more bucks. Why buy a highly fragile S8 for twice the price when you can get this one? It came new in the box. Did not have original charger, other than that just fine. Might buy another one."
B01F48QLFA,Steven Johnston,5,Arrived in a timely fashion. Phone looks great!
B01F48QLFA,Fallon M Vieira,3,"Phone is fine, but the charger sent with the phone did not work for this phone since the charger was for an iphone."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,thanks
B01F48QLFA,Stacey fuller,1,"It is NOT unlocked for Verizon, as stated, but for TMobile, making it useless to me."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,The home button on the Samsung Galaxy 7 was chipped and the finish was half gone.
B01F48QLFA,JOSE F MIRANDA,5,great phone and the price is awesome â¦.the phone is just like new every thing works great ..
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,The phone was super nice and feels practically new. I didn't notice any scratches and it runs great
B01F48QLFA,Kindle Customer,5,It's a good phone if you aren't looking for something fancy. Was a great buy!
B01F48QLFA,Sarah,3,Everything on tht phone was good just the speaker is crappy cuz it was built on tht bottom
B01F48QLFA,Maria,1,After 4 months the phone screen has a purple tint under which has made the phone useless.
B01F48QLFA,nichole hawley,3,Product came with it defalted to Chinese. Hard to reset to english
B01F48QLFA,Rebecca Wilhelm,4,"The phone came in great shape with no blemishes. However, the charger plug or cord did not work. I would buy this again."

B01F48QLFA,Coach,1,The phone came with a screen that was burned. Worked fine but this isn't what I paid for.
B01F48QLFA,will brown,5,Great product. Good customer service.
B01F48QLFA,libby,3,"Product is NOT a factory unlocked phone. Product received is a Verizon phone, with all of the associated bloatware.

I was able to get it to work for Cricket (My service provider) after fiddling with settings and a lot of time digging through the internet."
B01F48QLFA,jadaneclarke,4,It just that the home button is too far from it's position from that it is good
B01F48QLFA,Carlita,5,"This is a really nice product, especially for the price."
B01F48QLFA,Nigel Denzel Hodge,1,"While all functions of the phone work as advertised, the battery life of the phone is so poor that it absolutely eclipses every other possible positive quality of this. Im currently getting only 6 hours of battery life worth only one hour of Screen On Time nested within the same time. This means that if i leave my house for drinks at 8pm, my phone will be basically dead by the time bars close and i wont be able to call an uber or even use google maps /maps to walk back to an apt or my house. Every time the screen is on the phone loses more than one percent per minute, even as the battery manager says it has hours left. I heard great things about the phone and battery life in particular and I know that it may be due to the fact that its refurbished or but its so distracting and such an inconvenience that I dont think it can be honestly used in a day-to-day environment. I have just contacted the company responsible and will amend my review if the issue can be quickly and adequately resolved."
B01F48QLFA,Wendy Steele,1,"Just got ""new"" phone and the battery is already dead after 4 hours the next day!"
B01F48QLFA,Zachary S.,5,i use it every day

It is just as good if not better than a brand new S7..... thank you guys for the speedy delivery as always"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,It works good.
B01F48QLFA,Nathan Rompel,5,Good product fast service
B01F48QLFA,Bryan H.,5,Works great
B01F48QLFA,Keith Foster,5,"I wanted to give it a little time before reviewing this to make sure everything worked properly. I'm about 3 weeks in and everything is great. It came with a charger, in a discreet brown box. The phone itself runs like brand new. At first I was concerned about the quality of a refurbished phone, but those anxieties have been laid to rest and I will certainly buy refurbished in the future to avoid increasing my monthly bill."
B01F48QLFA,Matthew Scott,1,Dislike
B01F48QLFA,Harder_Harmonies_,5,"Phone arrived on time with no defects and was easy to hook up to my already existing Verizon account.

Only issue was that there is a little tool needed to open the Sim Card tray that normally comes with the phone but was not included here. However, I was able to open the tray myself with a safety pin after a bit of fidgeting so this won't be too much of an issue."
B01F48QLFA,Dudeman,5,"Had the phone for over a month now. Works perfect! Was hesitant as it was refurbished, but was in great cosmetic condition and works flawlessay with verizon. Completely satisfied!"
B01F48QLFA,Oscar E.,5,"The phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. And acts like it's in absolute brand new condition. My phone came with the Samsung fast charger. Bottom line Iâm excited whit it.Samsung Galaxy S7 G930V , 32GB, Black Onyx, Verizon + GSM (Certified Refurbished)"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,3,"phone was in excellent condition but was verizon branded even though it was unlocked some applications would not function properly with my carrier, I had to return phone."
B01F48QLFA,Dustin Bowls 4XX,2,"Yeah it looks great...but the battery is completely shot, doesn't even last 2 hours! NOW I have to either return it or have the battery replaced which in a Galaxy S7 isn't exactly easy...I knew this was too good to be true."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,3,"Received the phone on time. The charger that came with the phone was slightly bent and also the battery on this phone sucks, it wont even last me during my entire 10 hour work shift which is very unacceptable because my phone is important for my job. Haven't tried contacting the seller because i know they won't help with the battery in a refurbished phone. Once i get paid again i may contact the seller or just go to a phone repair service to have a new battery put in. I will update review then"
B01F48QLFA,Peggy De Lorenzo,5,"Very happy with this phone. Bought it refurbished. Upgrading from the S4. 32 GB is very nice. Phone is faster. Everything worked. Had to get a new Sim card from my local Verizon dealer, which was easy enough. Could have cut down the card from the S4, but was easier just to get the new one. This phone still has headphone jacks, etc., so I am happy with it. Like this size, like the speed, like the price."
B01F48QLFA,Robert H,5,Very happy with my purchase. Was sceptical like everyone when deciding on a refurbished phone but so glad I did. When I opened the box the phone was flawless and OEM accessories. I am with Straight talk so I also purchased the Verizon nano sim from Amazon since my old S4 was micro then I was ready to go. I am a very satisfied customer. Thanks
B01F48QLFA,Luis PÃ©rez,5,All ok! Great!
B01F48QLFA,kelli burr,1,"Received package today.. Opened box to find the charger, the USB and NO PHONE... Extremely disappointed"
B01F48QLFA,Douglas Muir,5,Terrific phone. Battery life is low side.
B01F48QLFA,Saul,4,"Four stars since the first one was very defective out of the box. It would reboot every few minutes. They obviously do not check these phones very thoroughly. They were both in perfect cosmetic shape. The phone its self is a great phone. Good feel, weight etc. the screen is amazing and the camera is far better than my 5S was in low light. The only negative for me was the removal of the IR emitter. I used that a lot on my 5S."
B01F48QLFA,Comet Cowboy 46,5,"A phone is just a phone, made for calling and talking. NOT anymore. A cell phone is for Talking, Picture Taking, Note taking, my Calendar, My Appointment Book, for Games, News, Entertainment and on and on...OH did I mention you can even make phone calls, TEXT, send pictures and all that good stuff. A phone like the Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great 21st Century TOOL. Thanks Samsung. CC46"
B01F48QLFA,Bryan,5,"I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but I am presently surprised on how great the condition of the phone is. It looks brand new, came with all factory accessories it should, headphones charges and transfer adapter. I obviously can't evaluate the battery but, I haven't had any issue with the battery and seem to be new if not in great condition. I would definitely purchase again"
B01F48QLFA,DPR,4,"It's great phone with more features and possibilities than I need. In great shape, looked pretty much new excepting a couple minor scratches on the back.
Biggest beefs are that the battery life is less than expected and it gets crazy hot when using the GPS with the screen on."
B01F48QLFA,Connor Hines,3,"Great UI, design, and camera. Unfortunately the top speaker crackles if the volume is turned up too high. I suppose it's part of the risk of buying refurbished electronics."
B01F48QLFA,N,5,"This phone only had one light scratch on the back, activation at Verizon was simple. Battery seems fine, exceeds the duration of my former handset.
I'd buy another refurb from this vendor (Prime Mobility)"
B01F48QLFA,runningandrunning,1,"I had the phone less than 2 weeks when the screen died. I put it in a case and put a screen protector on it within a hour of it arriving, and never dropped it. But somehow the screen was broken."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"Phone came in near perfect condition, no scratches on the glass or dents on the metal. Came with fast charger, headphones, micro usb to usb adapter, and sim card tool. It's an amazing product and it works great. The battery lasts me all day for normal use or 6-8 hours of streaming video. I purchased my phone from Edge Cellular."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Works like a charm. No problems. Looked like it was brand new. Had to go to Verizon store to get the free sim and activation and no issues there either.
B01F48QLFA,L. Saldana,4,No problems with the phone. It comes with the charger cord and ear buds. It DOES NOT come with the cord to transfer your data from old phone to new (included when purchasing a new phone). It also does not come with the little key to pop open the little compartment for internal cards--you have to use a paperclip.
B01F48QLFA,CPTSIG,5,"Works perfectly. 9.9/10 condition. No complaints at all. Only works on Verizon so I had to change carriers, but my fault for not reading the description carefully."
B01F48QLFA,Elizabeth Robb,5,"It's taking a little getting used to since I upgraded from an S3, but I definitely like it. No issues so far other than operator lack of knowledge."
B01F48QLFA,Dan,3,"Overall, the phone is pretty good. Samsung did a good job. The handset I received is a close facsimile but its obvious that when it was refurbished some lower quality parts/methods were used. The screen is plagued with under-sensitivity. It can be downright frustrating to text or try to play games on it and have to deliberately press harder to get it to respond. The under-sensitivity also causes it to be unusable even with thin gloves. The charge port is also recessed on my particular handset. This hasn't caused any issues with charging yet, but it does make using a gear VR very frustrating. For the cost vs. a new one I can live with these faults, but I'll end up trading it in for a new phone much sooner than I would have if it worked as well as it should."
B01F48QLFA,RASSMU,5,"The refurbished Galaxy S7 phone I purchased from BuySPRY looked and performed like new with no cosmetic defects at all. I received the phone 4 days after ordering and the seller sent a follow up email the day after delivery to make sure I was happy. Took it to Verizon the same afternoon I received it and Verizon activated it with no problems. Battery life is great. It took 22 minutes to download my contacts, pictures, and apps from an older model Galaxy phone. I used quite a lot of Google searches to help me customize the phone the way I wanted. I love this phone. I looked at an S8, but for my needs, the few extra, and much more expensive, bells and whistles weren't worth it."
B01F48QLFA,Elsie,5,"Great phone! Works great did show some wear on the phone but not enough to be an issue. Other reviewers stated they got extras with their phones which you can't expect, nor was there a fast charger with it there was just a basic charger."
B01F48QLFA,Sophia,1,"Same quality at lower price? I thought it is case by case, but I got a bad one. My phone signal getting weaker and weaker and now I cannot receive any call inside of building."
B01F48QLFA,sebastian,5,"just great. the phone was in perfect shape. no scratches or ds all ings.. anything. ive been using it for a couple months now and works perfectly. the only thing is that it comes with a asus charger. it DOES NOT FAST CHARGE and after the first month and some software updates, the phone did not recognize the charger anymore. but. for that price? it does not matter i got the samsung fast charger for 40 at best buy. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS!"
B01F48QLFA,Danielle,5,"Shipped quickly, phone is fully functional"
B01F48QLFA,Roundman72,4,the phone came fast. looked really good. had no issues getting it on verizon plan.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,I bought this cell phone and it completely broke at the first mild touch. Send a mail to the guys and told me it was not in the warranty. I have reasons to believe these cells are not as resistant as they should be.
B01F48QLFA,Richard G,5,Nothing to say but my wife loves it enough said
B01F48QLFA,Sharon Clapper,5,Love the phone. The charger that came with it does not work. Not sure what to do about that.
B01F48QLFA,Mac,5,Just what i needed for a job. Thanks
B01F48QLFA,Nicholas Smith,1,"Very disappointed in the customer service. Phone battery started failing, and they say the only thing they can do for me is have me ship the phone back to them for a repair. So now if I want the phone fixed I have to go buy another phone otherwise I am a couple weeks without a phone."
B01F48QLFA,sinead dobbin,3,Awesome phone but the Q&A section is little misleading this phone does not work with Verizon
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Great upgrade
B01F48QLFA,Flyer77,4,I would have given this product a 5 star rating but... the seller failed to include the USB adapter needed to perform the built in Smart Switch function for rolling over the contents of your old phone to this one. I solved this problem by ordering one here on Amazon. It should be included with the phone as it is a required piece of hardware.
B01F48QLFA,Manda S,5,"I've had the phone for 6 weeks now with absolutely no issues, it came looking beautiful in a Samsung box with brand new charger and headphones. Super happy with this purchase!!!"
B01F48QLFA,Tanya Gray,1,Did not work for me. It kept crashing.
B01F48QLFA,The Busy Bee,5,Very happy with this purchases. We updated from our S5's to these S7's and was very impressed with the quality and new lool including the packaging. Much faster than the S5's and takes very nice photos. Picked up the SIM chips directly from Verizon for only $20.
B01F48QLFA,S. Levy,5,"Acceptable, given the exorbitant price of smartphones."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,delivered as expected a few blemishes to be expected as it was used but I love it!
B01F48QLFA,Kindle Customer,4,item works perfect as described....
B01F48QLFA,Steve Klamm,5,"Great phone! Being a refurbished phone, had a very small ding on it, otherwise perfect. I would buy again!"
B01F48QLFA,Hugh Green,5,GREAT PHONE
B01F48QLFA,James L. Bacon,5,New condition and works without flaw
B01F48QLFA,charles bailey,4,this phone works great. have gotten refurbished phones that did not work and had signs of water damage inside. saw it when checking the battery.
B01F48QLFA,Dean H,5,Works great!!
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Love it!
B01F48QLFA,Eric Angel,5,Great phone. Works on AT&T. Quality refurbish.
B01F48QLFA,BDCOOK,2,Needed a charging port replaced. Intermittent wired charging. Too bad..... nice phone otherwise.
B01F48QLFA,Sherry,5,How refreshing to get just what I ordered!
B01F48QLFA,Chris Whisonant,5,"This is a great upgrade from my Galaxy S5 - it is SO MUCH faster even with little things like connecting to my bluetooth headset. I was a little hesitant to purchase the Verizon model (G930V) since I am an AT&T customer. I was told in the AT&T store when I had to activate the new sim card that since it's a CDMA device that it would be stuck on the ""H"" (Hospitality) speed network which would not be LTE but would be on 3G speeds. The mobile network will sometimes switch over to H or 3G, but it does stay on 4GLTE most of the time - I'm just using the normal AT&T APN settings. I just tested and got 43Mbps down and 9Mbps up on the mobile network - this is definitely not 3G speed. :) I still need to work through a voicemail issue, though.

Also, the device came to me in what appears to be like new condition. There was a small scuff on the top of the phone, but the screen seems pretty much flawless."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,4,Worked flawlessly. Great buy. Great price.
B01F48QLFA,greg,1,"Biggest pile of junk. Does not like to read sun cards for Verizon, when it does it only works for 5 minutes. Constantly turns off and resets itself."
B01F48QLFA,Donna39,5,"Not even a scratch to show it was a refurbished model. It works very well, and is much better than my older phone."
B01F48QLFA,benjamin t. murdock,5,"Phone arrived in 3 days, everything was great. More than satisfied!"
B01F48QLFA,Kevin Catalano,1,I received a US Cellular phone instead of verizon. Really disappointing.
B01F48QLFA,SwimmerDude,1,Charging function stopped working within a week of purchase. Only could charge wireless. Would not recommend
B01F48QLFA,retired75,5,so much better than my S4; the reduced power consumption feature is a real plus.
B01F48QLFA,Pundarella,4,"The only two drawbacks are (1) speaker sound quality is noticeably lower than a ""new"" phone, and (2) this is with respect to the model in general -- the glass on S7's is apparently pretty delicate, and after dropping it 3 feet onto concrete (with no case), I've learned that glass cracks/repairs are EXPENSIVE. (Apparently the glue and other tech aspects on the S7 mean that you'll almost certainly have to replace the glass *and* LCD/Digitzer. $200 at our local shop, ouch.)"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,Just what I wanted
B01F48QLFA,J. Ledvina,4,"The phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. I'm really happy about taking this chance so far.

I'm knocking off one star because the ""relevant accessory"" wall plug charger it came with does not support Samsung's Fast Charge - it's labeled as supporting 2v at 5A only. The original Samsung charger supports variable voltage/amperage combinations up to 15 watts. It's not a huge deal compared with the savings over buying the phone new or even getting refurbs from Verizon. I ordered a Quickcharge-compatible wall plug by Aukey on Amazon for 15 bucks. It's also possible that other sellers may include a fast charger."
B01F48QLFA,Joshua R,5,"For those who struggled with the horrible battery life of previous galaxy phones, finally this one is tolerable. I highly recommend the upgrade. I finally can feel safe without charging my phone multiple times a day..."
B01F48QLFA,Mom of Player,5,Came as stated.
B01F48QLFA,maryb,3,Phone was in good condition and shipping was good. I broke the screen and when I had it repaired it was discovered to have been repaired previously with a non ome screen. Very disappointing considering the comment for the phone said it was new.
B01F48QLFA,brian,1,Supposed to be in brand new condition and I received a phone with a big chip in the home button. Returned.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,I had to send the phone back because every time i was making a phone call it would lose internet connection i use my phone to travel so i cant have problems like that.
B01F48QLFA,Kaitlyn,1,"This phone is NOT unlocked and will NOT work on the sprint, boost, or virgin mobile networks. Very dispointed with that. Overall, the phone works great, came in great condition, but the not unlocked this is a bummer."
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought two of these refurbished Galaxy S7's. I've only had them less than a week. My wife's appears to be working well, but mine hangs up and needs a system reset several times a day. This happens when it is idle for a length of time - several hours. Seems OK if it is on a charger, but if left overnight off the charger it is unresponsive in the morning and needs the system reset. When it comes on it still had battery life two nights, but the battery was at 0% another night. Sometimes it hangs up during the day after being idle a few hours, even with a nearly fully charged battery. Looks like I'll have to send mine back.

Also, I have a hard time typing on that touchscreen keyboard - seems I have to backspace once for every 2-3 characters I try to type. But in fairness, my grandkids seem to have far less difficulty. Maybe I'll get accustom to it.

UPDATE: The day I wrote that review, I arranged to return the bad phone and buy a new one. But I did not send it back right away. That was about a week ago and I haven't experienced the problem since. The S7 had required a couple system updates - perhaps they fixed the problem. I've decided to retain the phone since then. I'll leave the score as is."
B01F48QLFA,Jhoana melgarejo,1,"in fact it looks well it has all the same but it does not serve the calls never who comes in the internet never wants to grab it, if you think it better buy one that if it is original because it is in only one copy and for that reason it does not work"
B01F48QLFA,Gavin,3,DOESNT COME WITH A SIM CARD!!! AND OBVIOUSLY DOESNT GO THROUGH STRAIGHTALK.
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,Do not buy this product. Battery exploded.
B01F48QLFA,Daniel,1,"The battery in this phone is incredibly weak.
Shouldn't a refurbished phone come with a new battery?
Don't waste your money!"
B01F48QLFA,Amazon Customer,1,I bought this phone and after getting it activated three days later took it off the charger and set it down and looked at it two hours later and the screen messed up and I can't even use it it looks like black ink Under my screen
B01F48QLFA,Redfour5,5,"I actually bought an unlocked S9 from this group and it works great. Got a 20% off Amazon like one day thing, so it was very cheap and that was why I did it but in thrall of all the hype. BUT, I had to give up my S7 I had gotten from Verizon for about six months to my wife as her old S5 finally bought the dust.

I gotta tell you I really loved the S7 having come from an S5 back in August of 2018. Essentially, an S7 is an S5 on steroids with a better OS updated to Oreo in like October 2018 so recent. The S7 is all about substance over form. The S7 in some ways is the last of the purely functional phones with a hard button. Samsung reached a peak with this phone. They essentially fixed all the ""issues"" they had with the S5 (plastic) and S6 (glitchy not polished ideas) and created a nice looking decent phone with a good camera, water resistance and a fast chip inside. Ever since, for the S8 and S9 all they did was make em prettier and faster with bells and whistles. The glass backs on the S8's and 9's are just another thing waiting to break. You better get a good case. They are slick in your hand too. But that screen is nice I must admit, but it is obvious that the new phones are all about form first substance second. It must be prettier and more flashy and oh by the way, it is very fast.

But we are talking about the S7 and it is a very good phone for the average user who isn't going to play shooter games and doesn't need the latest, greatest and flashy. The S7 is not slow. It s a highly functional phone that is water resistant (IP68), pretty darn fast built like a tank (metal), with unconnected fast charging and with a very decent camera. I loved it. I love its size in a hand. It fits perfectly in pockets whereas the S9 is long. Not a biggie..until you bend over in jeans. And I am not too sure I am totally sold on these curved front glass on the S8's and S9's. I have already cracked one tempered glass screen protector because of the little pretty curved glass front. I never had a problem on my S5 or the S7. Apparently, this is common. The S7 is a little solid brick (still pretty) has a nice solid protective metal bezel and back and with a screen protector is good to go always. I have lately picked the old S7 up off the charger and noticed right away how comfortable it was in my hand remembering it fondly. The S9 is a great phone, but I miss the S7's pure functionality as a practical necessary device that ""fit"" in so many ways. I may try to see if the significant other will trade me. She does like that Lilac back on the S9...

So, I promise you if you are an Android person over 50 and just want a nice functional fast reliable phone that still looks good without a case, go with one of these and save yourself around 500 bucks. You won't regret it."
B01F48QLFA,Stickman,2,"I hate this thing. Maybe I'm spoiled by the LG, but the functionality of this Samsung sucks.

Three things that drive me nuts the most:

#1. To unlock the phone from a sleep state first you have to hit the function button. Then you have swipe the screen. Then you have to swipe your pattern. Compare this to the LG, double tap on the screen puts it to sleep, double tap wakes it up, swipe a pattern if you have one. FAST and easy.

#2. Battery non-life. My LG I could go for a week. Even when using it heavily it would last 3 days. 5-7 days if I didn't use it much. The Samsung eats the battery in 2 days if not used and 1 day if it's used. Yes, you can turn on the battery saver, but then most anytime you need to do anything other than answer a call you have to turn it off. Very much a PITA.

#3. Alarm. You have to press and hold, the ""button"" (on the screen not the actual button) and then wait, and wait, and wait, and then swipe to turn it off. LD, tap once and it's done.

There are more reasons I dislike this phone. Most of it has to do with the fact that I've used LG most of my life and they function better and faster. If you don't know any better you might like the Samsung, but I'm selling it and going back to the an LG. Yes the camera is better in the S7, but the S7 is much heavier then the LG I previously had. It's also bigger. Not by a lot in terms of inches, but when I put the LG in my shirt pocket I barely knew it was there. The S7 is like a paperweight more than a phone."
B01F48QLFA,Jesse Hall,4,"First off, let me say that I don't like Apple phones. I prefer Android much more than iOS, so all problems I have with this phone have purely to do with the phone itself, not the operating system it runs.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy s7 is great. It's a fast phone, has a great camera, quick fingerprint scanner, super high quality screen, and just looks really, really good. But, on the contrary, there are some things I just don't like about this. So, I've made up a pros and cons list:

Pros
* High quality screen
* Looks good
* Great camera
* Fast fingerprint scanner
* Feels comfortable in my hands
* Runs smooth and quick
* Expandable storage
* Durable
* Water proof

Cons
* Glass back
* Can become slow over time
* Occasionally gets hot
* Not the best battery life when compared to other popular phones

My main problem with the Galaxy S7 is the glass back. I absolutely hate it. In fact, it's the reason I don't give this phone 5 stars. Let me explain why.

First, the fingerprints. I absolutely hate it when my phone gets fingerprints all over it, as I'm sure many of you do too. An aluminum backing, like the iPhone and Google Pixel use, is much better. Not only does it not get those finger prints, but it also doesn't crack.

I've had the glass backing on mine crack twice now. The first time I tossed my phone and the back hit a hard piece of plastic and cracked. I got it replaced with OEM glass within a week of that happening.

One day, I was in class lighting leaning against a desk talking with my friends with my phone in my pocket. All of the sudden I heard a cracking noise only to pull out my phone and find the back cracked. Again.

So, with that said, know this phone is super good and I absolutely love it, but my issues with the glass back has been enough to make me want to switch away from Samsung. I'm likely going to get a Google Pixel next."
B01F48QLFA,Adam,2,"Had an S5 and an S7, and I have not gone back to a Galaxy since breaking my S7 and do not plan on ever going back.

The S7 was great in the beginning,but after about half a year or maybe less my Galaxy S7 became very buggy (not uncommonly to the point where the phone would have to be restarted), a battery drainer (I am not a heavy phone user, and I keep my screen at 50% brightness at most times), and just frequently frustrating in general.

Also the camera is atrocious. It quickly developed a bug where I could not focus on objects within a foot of the lens FOR THE LIFE OF ME.

Bottom line, I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone! There are MUCH MUCH MUCH better phones in this price bracket from companies like Motorola, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Essential to name a few."
B01F48QLFA,timsdd,1,"This phone locks up (unresponsive) far more than my Galaxy S5 ever did. It seems to do it at the most inconvenient times too like when I am trying to use the camera....the camera is great and I love the features but I could NEVER use the phone as my go to camera for the lag reasons.

Or take today, I missed 2 incoming calls (it never even showed incoming) and then when I tried to call VM the phone basically locked up. I was finally able to respond to a text but this thing lags even when typing!

Even after I rebooted...which sometimes takes 90 seconds for me to initiate when it gets into lag more, it was slow after the reboot!

It's unreal. I think this is my last Galaxy."
B01F48QLFA,LE,1,"This refurb was not the quality I expected.
1. The screen had obviously never had a screen protector and was scuffed and micropitted.
2. It took a long time for the battery to fully charge - 2-1/2 hours from 61%.
3. When I turned it on, it was in Chinese!
Immediately returned."
B01F48QLFA,KnowItAll,4,"It's a solid phone in very excellent condition, and the price was great.

It's still pretty tied to Verizon - you have to do quite a bit of manual setup to get it to work properly with other carriers (I had to call T-Mobile to have them reset some settings). I also get some annoying notifications about the SIM card not being from Verizon when I restart the phone."
B01F48QLFA,Richard J. Windisch,2,"I've had several Samsung Galaxy phones. The gorilla glass is nice. However, I dropped it once, with a protective case on it and it cracked all the way down the back. It appears that the back glass is not as strong as the front. I'm done with Samsung phones. I'm going to have to carry a cracked phone for at least a couple of years."
B01F48QLFA,A,1,"The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have a common defect where the rear camera glass cover will spontaneously shatter. There are quite a few reported cases of this online, and Samsung is as of yet not acknowledging it as a manufacturing defect. Because of the design of the Galaxy S7, it is virtually impossible to repair this yourself, and in order to have it fixed you have to go without a phone for over a week after shipping the phone to Samsung, paying them to repair it, and waiting for them to ship it back. In my case the rear camera glass cover shattered while sitting on my desk, and there are numerous other reports of similar events (as crazy as that sounds). Samsung Support is unhelpful and denies that this issue has been previously reported, despite evidence to the contrary."
B01F48QLFA,Chrissi Burrell,3,Not my favorite phone. Texting is terrible. I've typed things over and over and they are still wrong. You can be watching a video and sit the phone down and it disappears. I do not recommend.

B01DRV2BBY,(Â¬â¿Â¬),3,"Some things you should know:

1) You have to use the GreatCall service. You cannot choose your own carrier.

2) You can port your number, but that requires waiting on the phone for 1 hour while listening to canned music to activate the phone. No, you can't do that online or any other way. Now that I've waited the whole hour, I have to call them back tomorrow to have them port the number. They couldn't do it all in one shot. I have to prepare to wait again for 1 hour. I know this because I've called them numerous times in the past for another device and the minimum wait time is about 30 minutes. On weekends, it's murder.

3) We all know there are fees, but there is an activation fee of $35 in addition to everything else. If you set it up online, it's $25, so even if you have to call to port your number, get everything else filled in online (don't press the final submit button before calling). They can see that you've filled out the form and will activate for $25 (which is still a crock, IMO).

The phone is easy to use. The buttons are big and the sound is loud and clear. I would have bought any other dumb phone for my mom (don't like that extra-long wait time with customer service or technical support when there are problems) except I need the GPS capability for when she gets lost or when she loses her phone. For that service, I have to pay $25/month. I had to buy 1000 minutes per month to make sure she doesn't go over (she likes hour-long phone calls) because it's $0.35/min if she exceeds the limit. That's $15/month for the minutes (the minutes are cheaper because I pay for the GPS service).

I haven't tried the GreatCall emergency service with Jitterbug, but I did with another device in the recent past and they've always picked up promptly. If you need this service, the monthly bill is worth it. I'm not sure if my mom will even remember to push the well-placed red button in an emergency. Oh well. They do have reminder services for her medications and and check-in service to make sure things are okay. Those come with her $25/month service plan, but she won't be using them.

___________________

UPDATE 1/26/18: I was mistaken. Mom finds the GreatCall button just fine -- too fine. She pushes the button because she can't remember which button to push to call (it's supposed to be YES). Anyway, she calls and then hangs up and doesn't pick up the call when they call back to check on her, so then they call everyone on the emergency list until they find someone who can tell them Mom's okay. I'm thinking I need to tape that GreatCall button so she stops pushing it. She does manage to make some calls to me, so it's still better than her iPhone.

I'm not using the medication reminder and check-in services because they are automated calls. I don't think she will understand that it's a computer talking to her. For her to have to answer an automated voice (I think she would have to push buttons), that's not going to work. Besides, each call eats up the minutes on her plan. Every GreatCall call eats up minutes from her plan.

The only good thing about the minutes is they roll over. I happened to enroll near the date when it rolls over so right away, I got 1000 minutes rolled and the total number of minutes we started with was 2000 minutes, even though our plan is 1000 minutes per month. That's the secret. FWIW, the invoice was billed until the 16th. I activated the phone a few days before that."
B01DRV2BBY,S. Lionel,5,"We've all seen the ads for Jitterbug phones, and maybe some scoffed at them. While I am a ""senior"", I'm not the target market for Jitterbug as I am technical and know my way around smartphones. I recognize, however, that not everyone is and I've seen first-hand how utterly unusable many modern phones are for people with limited vision, hearing or who have trouble with tiny buttons and complex menus. The Jitterbug phones are brilliantly designed for these users and it was fascinating to explore the new Jitterbug Flip to see what Greatcall had done to make this phone so usable. This is going to be a long review, as some of mine are, but the length is necessary.

Let's start with the phone itself. It's larger and heavier than most current flip phones, but it is easy to pick up and open. On one side of the closed phone is a small black-and-white LCD screen that, when illuminated, gives the current time, date, and whether the ""5Star"" emergency service is enabled. The text of this is large and clear. If the display is off (it goes dim after 5 seconds and off after 10), it can be turned on by pushing any of the three side buttons. This side of the phone also has a camera lens, LED flash and a smaller notification LED. The other side of the closed phone has a speaker grille, with a small raised dot in the middle that lifts it up just enough for sound to not be muffled if the phone is set down on the table.

The right side of the phone has large up and down volume buttons plus a smaller button whose only function is to turn on the camera's LED as a flashlight when the phone is open. (But this button, as I noted above, will turn on the outside display.) The left side has a MicroUSB jack that can be used for charging or data transfer, and a headset jack.

The phone is supplied with a charging cradle which takes its power from a MicroUSB cable (supplied) and power adapter (also supplied). You don't have to use their cable or charger. Just drop the closed phone into the cradle and it charges via contacts on the bottom - very easy to use. When charging the display indicates either Charging or Charge Completed (and the notification LED turns on). It also makes a small sound when you start charging and when you remove the phone from charging. The phone will also charge from the side MicroUSB jack.

Now let's open the phone. The top half has the color LCD display and when you open it (assuming it's powered on - press and hold On/Off for that), it always goes right to the Phone Book main menu entry and you hear a dial tone (!) from the speaker. Yes, I did say a dial tone. This lets the user know that the phone is working and that there is a signal.

The bottom half has large buttons with large-type labels. These buttons have a reassuring click-feel and the legends are raised. They're also backlit when the display is on. In addition to the number pad, there are buttons for Speakerphone, On/Off, Yes, No and up and down arrows. The only other button is at the bottom, the red ""5*"" button for emergency calls. If you have purchased one of the packages that include ""5Star"", then pushing this connects you to trained operators who have quite a bit of information about you (entered on the Greatcall web site in advance) plus GPS coordinates. If you don't have the 5Star service, this button calls 911. It announces in a voice it is doing this and you can press the No button to cancel.

The main menu has a single list of options which you select from using the up and down buttons, then press Yes to activate that function. As I wrote earlier, Phone Book is the default. Press Yes on that and you're shown your first phone book entry. The up and down buttons scroll through the entries, and two preset entries are for ""Urgent Care"" and ""Health and Wellness Alert"". While you can manage the phone book on the phone, it's much easier to do it on the web site where you can also reorder entries. Each entry has the name and number displayed in large, clear text, with a ""CALL?"" action at the bottom. Pressing Yes will call that number. Pressing No backs out to the main entry. Most screens have a colored bar at top and bottom with information such as which menu entry you're in (or your phone number if at the main menu), and the action you can take by pressing Yes or No.

I will note here that you can dial numbers from almost any screen using the keypad. As you enter the numbers they are displayed in VERY large text. There is also a ""Voice Dial"" feature - this is free but you have to call to have it activated. It was not enabled on my test phone so I could not try it. If enabled, Voice Dial will be an option on the main menu - select it and then speak the name from the phone book to dial. I was told that you could request that this be the default when you open the phone - great for visually impaired users.

The sound quality of phone calls was excellent on both ends. The speaker volume is adjustable to Low/Medium/High. Pressing the ""Spkr"" button turns on the speakerphone which is also loud and clear.

When a call is received, the ringtone plays, the phone vibrates, and the caller's number (and name if in your phonebook) is displayed. If the phone is closed you answer by just opening the phone. (There is a choice of seven preset ringtones - you can't add your own, but you can specify a particular ringtone for callers in your phone book.) You can stop the ringing by pressing one of the volume buttons when closed. If open, press Yes to accept or No to decline - a large message on the screen tells you this. The ringer volume is adjustable in three steps as well as off using the volume buttons when not on a call. If you miss a call, the outer display shows ""Missed Call"", the LED flashes, and an alert sound is given every five minutes for 30 minutes. If you then open the phone it tells you the missed call(s) and lets you review them (or press No to go back to the main menu).

The phone supports Bluetooth headsets and cars - the instructions for pairing are easy to understand and the phone leads you through the process nicely.

Voicemail (an optional service) also gets the ""easy to use"" touch. It's the entry in the main menu just above Phone Book. The first time you select that, it connects you to the voicemail service and gives a detailed introduction to how to use it. You control voicemail with either the Yes/No buttons when it asks a question, or you can say the words. You can also say Skip, Delete or Exit at any time. You're first given new messages with an option to save each one. Then you can review saved messages, and lastly you can review or record your personal greeting. This can be a full greeting of your choice or just your name - in the latter case callers hear ""This is the Jitterbug voicemail system for ..."". When voicemails are played you get the date/time but not the number - for that you have to go to the Missed Calls list (and as you see each one, press Yes to call back.)

Text messaging is also available (various plans include different numbers of messages). You can select among a ""library"" of preselected messages (""How are you"", ""Call me"", ""I'm busy"", ""I miss you"", ""Where are you?"", and many more), or enter your own using the standard keypad method. An assist is that it can automatically capitalize the first letter of each sentence or word, or do all caps. When you receive a text, again a message shows on the outside display, it makes a sound and the LED flashes.

The phone has a camera and can take reasonably decent pictures (1200x1600 or 2MP) with flash used if the phone thinks it is necessary. Photos can be sent as MMS messages (not emailed) or, and this will strike terror into the hearts of grandchildren everywhere, posted to Facebook. In order to use Facebook you have to first connect your accounts at the Greatcall web site, where you can specify who will be able to see the posts (Friends, etc.). There is no ability to add text to the post. I tried this and it worked well. Your location is NOT saved with the photo or included in a FB post. (When I tried this indoors, it told me ""No Service"" even though I could make a call. When I took it outside it worked.) Photos can be reviewed on the phone, of course.

The camera is also used for a magnifier feature, great for reading menus in dimly-lit restaurants. The flashlight can be used in this mode and you can adjust magnification with the up/down buttons.

Other phone features... There are two ""brain games"" built in that can be fun, at least at first. Settings are limited - you can turn the power on/off jingle on or off, enable or disable the 5* button, select a default ringtone, and change the color scheme used. The ""Phone Info"" screen has minimal information such as battery level and signal strength. There is no alarm feature nor a music player.

The phone appears to run a heavily customized version of Android, and operates on the Verizon network. Battery life is maybe 2-3 days on standby, less if actively used or Bluetooth is on. There is no user-visible data connection, though it is evident to me that it relies on one behind the scenes to synch with the web site settings.

I'm not going to discuss all the various plans and services Greatcall offers, but I was impressed with the breadth of services ranging from minutes-only calling to full-blown ""we'll call you on a schedule to make sure you're ok"" features. Everything has a price, of course, but I thought the prices were reasonable for what you got.

Customer service is not only US-based but is available in multiple languages. The support agent I spoke with was clearly a native English speaker with an ""American"" accent and was easy to understand. I did have to wait about 15 minutes when I called the regular support line on a Friday afternoon - the recorded message suggested times to call that had shorter waits and also directed users to the web where, it is true, a lot of typical questions are answered. The web site is also easy to use with large text, easy to recognize navigation and lots of whitespace. A large printed manual is included that is also easy to read without a microscope.

After I did the initial setup, everything worked very well and I never saw anything that would be frustrating. It is clear that Greatcall has done a lot of research plus built on their experience to date with Jitterbug phones to produce a phone and service that is ideally tailored to a group left out by traditional phone manufacturers. One doesn't have to be a ""senior"" to love the Jitterbug Flip - if you have hearing, visual or motor impairments you'll find the phone and service easy to use. There is also a Jitterbug smartphone if you want, and even simpler phones, but I think the Flip hits its target square-on and I can recommend it highly. Yes, it deserves ""5 Stars""."
B01DRV2BBY,Angel Higuera,1,"I bought the flip phone on 12-27-17 for my elderly mom. The phone's design is great HOWEVER, the phone would refuse to ring (audible) after a few hours. I'm very sophisticated with tech devices and I tripple checked all the settings and the phone would still refuse to ring. Did everything I could think of to get the phone to ring and nothing. Called GreatCall's cust service, they did a software update that didn't fix it. They sent out a refurbed phone. Same problem. They sent out a new phone in the box, same problem. It's now 2-8-18, three phones later, my Amazon return window expired and GreatCall refuses to offer me my money back because I bought it on Amazon. The phones are now useless paperwieghts. Wasted months of me and my mom's time and my money."
B01DRV2BBY,Mz Blonde,5,"I like this little phone much more than anticipated, here's a run down of why you might, too:

Pros:
No frills
A dial-tone, a real dial-tone!
Large, really large keys
Cool Jazz ringtone available
Compact
Inexpensive plans through GreatCall, with paperless and paper billing out of Texas and a customer service center available
You get that satisfying flip- close to end a call
Yes and No keys guide you through every function
Camera
No internet
Texting

Cons:
Occasionally miss having a ""smart phone"" but the emotion passes instantly
No internet but this is not really a con if you don't miss the distraction"
B01DRV2BBY,Lothar,1,"Appears to be a good phone. My parent died shortly after getting the phone. I went to discontinue service, had to call. I was on hold 40 minutes first time and no one ever answered. 25 minutes second time and no answer. Will keep trying as I have time. Kinda shady if you ask me."
B01DRV2BBY,Gae Stimpson,1,"Features are perfect for my mother. We have replaced this phone 3 times. The first phone just stop working for no reason. Phone was fully charged. I called Amazon. They were nice enough to replace it without charging me since it was past 90 days. Received the next phone 2 days later. That phone worked for 3 days. She could call out but couldn't receive calls. The phone would just go to voicemail. Called Amazon again and spoke with someone about those issues. The phone was replaced in 1 day. Now this is the 3rd phone. My mother says it never rings so I'm not really sure what the issue is with this one or if there is one. Almost too scared to ask or check. I think her next move will be a landline. Very disappointed with the phone. Too many of the same issues, not very reliable, money wasted, would not recommend. This phone would not help a senior in dire need."
B01DRV2BBY,Pinkcat,5,"I had bought the previous model of the Jitterbug Flip phone for my Father in Law and he used it for a couple of years before it bit the dust. He keeps his phone on a lanyard around his neck all day with his house key. I bought this one to replace his phone and I was able to transfer him into the new phone from the old phone fairly easily by calling the Mygreat call Jitterbug customer service. I was concerned that the phone didn't have a lanyard loop hole, but it does on the corner. It's a little challenging getting the lanyard loop through but I was able to do it. I was able to change the ringer to an old fashion ""ring ring"", that's nice and loud. He has no problem using this as a basic phone. It has a magnifier that really doesn't work very well so don't even bother with that. It has tracking for an extra 5 dollars a month. So, if the phone gets lost, or if he is lost, I can see where the phone is in the Mygreat call account online or by the GreatCall app on my phone. My Father in Law has pushed the 5* by mistake a few times and they have always been there to help and have been very patient. To use the phone, all he has to do is open the phone and scroll to who he wants to call and click ""yes"" to call. I was able to enter his contacts list from the Greatcall website account, and they appear on his phone. To answer a call, he just opens the phone, nothing else. This is a fine phone for anyone that just wants a basic no frills phone, or for someone that needs some assistance with a phone. It's extra loud and the buttons are big and easy to see. If you're getting this phone for yourself or getting the phone for someone that needs assistance with the phone, I strongly suggest that you open an account on the GreatCall web site for your phone and you can enter information and see the phone stats there. If you're a caretaker, you can also get the phone tracking and download the GreatCall Link app on your smart phone."
B01DRV2BBY,supertvwacer,1,Worst phone ever the phone itself is not bad impossible to activate worst customer service ever ever was transferred six times after 2 hours of being on the phone and they did nothing could not activate the phone going to be returning it soon as possible
B01DRV2BBY,Gina Vastola,1,"I bought this phone for my uncle with some trepidation because of the negative reviews. They were right. At it's highest setting the ringer volume is too low. Also, signal strength is poor. That's not the worst part. The only service available for the phone is from GreatCall, the company that makes Jitterbug so we subscribed to a plan with GreatCall. He received the first bill about a week after activating the phone and deciding he did not want it. It was for service for June 4-July 4. He did not activate the phone until June 30. When he canceled he was not told to disregard the bill that included a $35 activation fee. I called to get the bill waived. The person I spoke with said the activation fee applies because the phone was activated. Since is there no way to know the quality of the phone or the service until it is activated it is absurd to make that statement. I asked for a supervisor; that didn't help any. I'm not on the account so the supervisor would not discuss the issue with me. I will never buy a Jitterbug again."
B01DRV2BBY,Anna DeBough,1,"Starts out you think you will be paying just under 14$ a month but it ends up, after taxes and everything, to be 44$."
B01DRV2BBY,Customer,1,This phone is not worth the money... It worked correctly for about 3 weeks. Nothing but problems since. Jitterbug phone service is fine and affordable but the phone itself was a waste.
B01DRV2BBY,LHB,1,"The WORST phone out there. I bought this for my mother, who is 89 years old. It worked great for about 3 months...right past the warranty. Now the volume doesn't work right, the battery won't charge like it should and the ringer doesn't ring 80% of the time. We also signed her up with Great Calls who offers a wonderful $19 a month, with very limited minutes. What they don't tell you is that your minutes are used whenever anyone calls you. So, if you get a solicitation call or your kids want to call you, they hold it against your minutes. My mom got a bill for $175.....for overage. She is on a fixed income. These people are crooks...who charges minutes to the user whenever they are called..its a rip off. They are obviously taking advantage of old folks. There should be a law!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jan Enjada,1,"Wouldn't activate. After hours of receiving ""FAILURE"" TO ACTIVATE, messages I tried calling Jitterbug. They have no customer support accept Monday through Friday 9:00am to 5:00PM. That resulted in contacting super AMAZON, to return poorly made, undependable cell phone."
B01DRV2BBY,L. Bergstresser,1,"I cannot entirely give a full review on how the phone works and its ease of use because my father never had the coverage I was advised he would have so he assumed the damn thing wasn't working. I called Great Call specifically prior to buying a Jitterbug phone to ensure that my father would be covered in the service area. They asked for his specific address. I gave it and was advised there was ample coverage. There wasn't. My father thought he was losing it (I think the point of this phone/service is to assist older people, not to add to their confusion). When my father called to request assistance he was advised that his area ""was a spotty area they get complaints about a lot"". Oh really? Interesting. When I called to verify before purchasing the phone/service the coverage was confirmed. Now, I am stuck with a phone that I paid for that I cannot return and must now buy a new phone and plan for my father and, worse than all of it, he has to learn how to use yet another phone which is not easy for older people. I am disgusted and really annoyed that Greatl Call would not be honest with me before I went down this road. I will not recommend the phone or hte service to anyone and, in fact, will warn people against using this service."
B01DRV2BBY,P. Mortensen,1,"I owned the older version of this newer device. I had a couple of problems with it, called customer service and the rep said I simply needed a new battery which was sent to me and I made the switch to the new battery. I thought I needed a new phone but replacing the battery seemed to resolve the problem....for about ten months or so. Leaving charging overnight sometimes resulted in a zero percent charge or sometimes sixty per cent.
I called and spoke to a young man who said I probably needed a new phone. Ok, so I ordered the new one for 79 dollars plus I paid the 20 dollars charge for an expedited shipping of two days. I believe it was longer than that time but I still had my old one that was functioning. I get the phone, call the customer service for activation help because I was unable to do what was supposed to be a simple task. A rep then turned off or I guess more correctly de-activated the old phone. Then we proceeded to activate the new one. This very nice lady located in Reno said repeatedly, ok. I'll get you where we need you to be. Three times she couldn't get the phone activated, even after I went fro one end of my house to the other, then outside on the patio, then sitting in my car and finally at the end of the driveway.
So, finally she says she's going to move me up to a tech person and she transferred me and I sat Andy waited and waited and waited with the usual we're so sorry but this a particularly busy day, etc. ad nauseum. So now I get the next person and he clearly had no clue who I was and I have to answer all the question all over again, e.g. Name address, account number and password and then I had to explain the problem and repeat the promise that moving he to this tech person would solve the problem...yeah, I'm right. Same business again...tried at least three times with no luck...he tells me that he's going to transfer me to someone else, presumably more expert than he.
Same story again..on hold, apologizes, music and finally I am connected to a man who surely must have the technical knowledge to do get this done. Wrong! Multiple attempts at activation failed and I'm now up more than 35 minutes to get this fixed.nthis fellow tells me that this issue has been a problem with some phones coming from the manufacturer defective in this regard. His solution is to send me another phone that will have been activated by whomever at Great Call. I agreed but I told him I NEEDED a phone right away and to please do an overnight shipment but he says that can't be done. And so I agreed to the two to three day expedited charge of twenty dollars. Now this was on a Friday afternoon so he said I would have the phone by Tuesday or Wednesday and I knew there was no chance to get it on Tuesday. I hung up the phone and realized I had let myself get suckered into paying the expedited charge twice,..and WHY should I have to to have a defective phone shipped to me and then repeat the charge !
Tuesday comes and goes. Wednesday same thing. So meanwhile I've had no phone and I don't even have access to my phone book. I had been pleasant up to this point and completely accepting of the run around I had with three problem solvers who could not solve and then waiting for a phone that was PROMISED to arrive by no later than Wednesday.
Back on the phone to customer service and finally, after the first person who was totally clueless about the situation and thus transferred me AGAIN to another rep, was allegedly speaking to someone who had the solution. Guess what, he had to make a phone call to someone in shipping and returned after ANOTHER long wait to tell me that not only had the phone not been sent, but that no one had even activated the phone. And now I'm pretty ripped! He said another two to three business days and I'd have it once they programmed the phone and then did the two to three day delivery. I said WRONG ANSWER and that I wanted him to get either his supervisor or the CEO of the company to get this fixed or I would two things. First I said that I would cancel the phone account and eat the cost of unfair expenses and I also would cancel the account I have with them for their Splash device, the medical alert system. Number two was that I promised that I would give a negative review; a detailed report of how horrible the device was and recommend that people go elsewhere for a phone. So here I am writing. And now come this Monday afternoon (this is Friday), if I don't have the phone, on Tuesday morning I am closing both my accounts with the company and demanding the 79 dollars I was charged for the defective phone they sent me AND I wanted the twenty dollar was do edited fee I had to pay.
If you're looking for reliability..go elsewhere. Also I thought that because no one who was ""above"" the four people with whom I spoke emailed me or called me on my home phone to tell me that he or she was personally going to march down ou up to wherever they had to go to find a solution.
A lousy way to run a business in my opinion!"
B01DRV2BBY,Smartshopper,5,"After 8 months of use I am very pleased. You won't find a phone more easy to navigate. Activation was simple. Can adjust speaker and rings to loud. Dials are easy to see.Charges quickly. Customer service good.Sturdy construction ( I have dropped it twice on concrete.) I appreciate it is easy to find my own phone number and today's date and time with one step. Negative reviews may be attributable to varying cognitive impairment of us senior citizens. Children should be prepared to activate phone for their parent and walk them through how to use it, altho I had no trouble.
Cons include : Extra $5.00 for voice mail. Can't connect to internet , scan coupons, listen to music, read e-mail, and no alarm. I am 75 and my life is much less stressful after giving up my smartphone. It was a tradeoff that worked for me. I got tired of broken screens, bad customer service and not being able to hear. I threw my Samsung smart phone in the canal and haven't looked back yet."
B01DRV2BBY,KK,1,"I bought this phone for Dad because it had xlarge buttons and other nice features. When I called to activate, I got the unmistakable impression that this guy was going to be pushy and was indeed trained to do so. You know, like when you've just been told that you won the vacation of a lifetime and all you have to do is sign over your savings, checking, and all annuities. And when you say that you will most likely pass, there argue with you and make you feel like a loser for letting such a deal slip through your fingers?? That was this guy, well maybe he wasn't ""quite"" that bad. But, pretty bad. Anyway, he pushed hard for me getting all the bells and whistles with as much persuasive langue as he could muster, and was fairly disappointed that after all that, I still just wanted the $19.99 a month plan. Then, he informed me that there would be a $35 activation fee, to this I wanted to say ""What!!!"", who charges a fee for activating their cell phone??? Oh, right, I guess the companies that have cell phones that can only be used exclusively with their company. That makes sense because you can't just take the phone to another more reasonable company who doesn't charge activation fees. Right. Anyway, I continued on, ignoring my irritability thus far because I knew dad would love the phone. But then, the ""Kicker"", my $19.99 a month plan turned into $28.99 just before I gave my credit card number, when I asked ""how did that happen?"", he told me ""Taxes"". What kind of a tax is $9 on $20??? That was it, the camel's back broke and I decided that dad would have to do without there ""super senior"" phone. Way to go Great Call for raking the seniors over the coals. I will find a phone elsewhere and I advise others to do the same."
B01DRV2BBY,Pamela Greenwood,1,"I would not recommend this phone or this service to anyone. I purchased for my 87 year old mother who simply wanted an easy phone with big buttons to use. So many things wrong here, starting with their customer service department, who I called to ask some questions before I activated the phone. I spoke with âPrincessâ (no lie) who told me my mother could have a BRAND NEW NUMBER and therefore avoid annoying calls searchig for the person who last had the phone # she would receive - 100% WRONG. Next - everything is extra - canât transfer contacts over from previous phone, have to be entered manually on phone or online or, for a few, their operators will enter for you. Next - donât believe the $14.99 or $19.99 for minutes - thatâs just the start of their monthly charges. Princess told me she had to have a data plan so her phone would update - 100% WRONG. She told me that was a problem they continue to have was that customers saw those prices and mistakenly thought that was the entire monthly fee - apparently they are well aware of their deceitful advertising. Next - voice mail is an extra charge. EVerything is an extra charge - I got the picture very fast. Had to go through 2 folks before I got a manager. Needless to say, we are returning this phone - what a sham!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"Bought this phone for my mom who has vision problems back in November. It has been nothing but a problem from practically the beginning. Biggest issue is it just goes dead. Taking the battery out and reinserting it fixes the problem. Though this happens with other cellphones once in a while - they may lock up or turn off - this one has this issue way too much. Really a disappointment.

Will be looking for another phone soon."
B01DRV2BBY,Susan Chini,1,"The phone is fine. I bought this for my Mother because of the large numbers. That is all she wanted. However when trying to activate the phone, it was a very hard sell. They are very pushy and condescending because she did not want any extra service. They say at the beginning of the call it will take a half an hour. And it does. 25 of those minutes are bullying you into the extra service."
B01DRV2BBY,KIM L,1,"I bought this phone for my father thinking this would be the ultimate easy phone and a medical device at the same time. Well the battery doesn't last more for a day for some reason and it just doesn't give you what a regular phone would as a flip nevermind of smartphone, the biggest problem is the service half the time the phone saying not in service not in service and the service is on. I am totally disappointed I really thought this would be the phone to have with the app so I can make sure he's okay when I'm not home to me this was a total letdown and will be canceling my service"
B01DRV2BBY,Wesley Wildermuth,1,"To the seller posting above. ""Liar liar, pants on fire."" This phone is locked into the Great Calls phone network. You CANNOT just open it out of the box and use on a Verizon network. Great Calls uses the Verizon backbone, but you have to subscribe with Great Calls, so it really is NOT compatible with Verizon, or any other phone network, according to Great Calls support."
B01DRV2BBY,Henry,1,The calling plans are useless for people that like to talk on the phone and the coverage is spotty.
B01DRV2BBY,short dork,2,"I wore the IT customer support person down at Great Call. (The ""it"" phone for seniors that is supposed to be dummy proof.) She's sending a new phone replacement. But I suspect the same issue will unfortunately exist.

Inbound photo texts worked 50% during our testing. Outbound text messages (without photos) worked most of the time. Otherwise a ""no service"" message would display. We were encouraged to sit by the window or outside.

Text messages with photos did not work for Dad unless the phone was physically outside. Uh, not so convenient. But that's what 60 (!) minutes of troubleshooting resolved.

I can't say I'd recommend this.
The menu options are somewhat cryptic to understand. For example, once a photo text has been viewed it is *automatically* removed from the in-box. This is to cut down on hogging memory. To find it a user should know to look in photos.

If you're interested in replying to the text there's only one opportunity. Otherwise drill down to photo details, WRITE the phone number of the sender down and navigate to the main menu. Then tap Text > Yes > Send > Select Customize > draft message > Yes > scroll your entire phone book > click Yes when ""enter number"" appears > tap in the number.

Wait. You wanted to send a photo? Only possible from the main menu. Not from the text menu.

Know that calls to customer service always have a lengthy wait time. I personally found it a challenge to follow the trouble shooting steps. I'm glad my 85 year old father was not on the phone.

GreatCall.com never highlights how important using a phone outside is. Actual phone performance for our family was noted as ""poor"". Even though the phone was pressed to a window."
B01DRV2BBY,Professor Bill Gholson,1,"I purchased this phone for my father who had just been placed in a nursing home. I purchased it based on its ease of use for seniors and for the fact that the phone advertised that it works on the Verizon Network. I spent 6 1/2 hours of my time trying to get the phone connected on to my existing account and it was impossible. They advertise this phone incorrectly and deceitfully so that people will by it. Don't be fooled if you want to use this phone with Verizon. I ended up purchasing a LGRevere 3 from Verizon for the same cost as the Jitterbug. It also has all of the senior features. Do not buy this phone, even if it is just so that you don't support false advertising. I recommend the LGRvevere 3 if you are looking for a good, simple cell phone for seniors."
B01DRV2BBY,John Pair,5,"I said I would never have a cellular phone. Fed up with my land line carrier, I researced the Jitterbug and purchased mine from Amazon. Easy to set up, simple to use, loaded with useful features. Cut the land line and love my Jitterbug."
B01DRV2BBY,Isabella,1,"The keyboard on the jitterbug stopped working and would not hold voice mail. The keys to the phone was hard to press in and calls
often didnt' go through nor incoming calls. I liked the medical alerk key and the color red was nice. Great Calls could not help so I
closed the account back in 11-22-2017 with them. I would like to send this phone back to Amazon> How could I go about on doing this."
B01DRV2BBY,Stay@CF's,5,"What a great phone an absolute slamdunk upgrade from my moms previous phone which was not suitable for her considering hearing loss and other age related difficulties. Jitterbug truly put thought and care into designing this phone for old people. From the dialtone that is heard when opening the phone to initiate the call, to the large user-friendly buttons, to the choice buttons which are marked amazingly commonsensically ""Yes"" and ""No."" compared to the LG phone the AT&T store clerk sold my parents this phone is in another stratosphere entirely. The LG had a very light cheap plastic feel, small and difficult to press buttons, and of course the wonderful plan that he sold them at $50 per line/month included data which they simply don't use and texting which they don't do either so thank goodness they had rollover for those! As to the great call jitterbug service plans you can specify talk minutes only and the elder assist programs, have a range of options and price points starting at $20 a month going to 25 and then the Cadillac which gives you full replacement a concierge type service along with the five star red button, remote person tracking-finding ability from a link app on the Apple App Store or Google Play, all for about the same 50 bucks a month they were paying AT&T for a pretty lousy phone, too many minutes and data services they didn't need and never would use."
B01DRV2BBY,Cyclone Jane,1,"You will waste hours trying to activate this relatively expensive flip phone. The explanatory materials that come with it explain nothing, and there are hidden charges, such as an activation fee of unspecified amount. You cannot use PayPal.

Two phone numbers are offered to assist the buyer, but they play a tape claiming an exceptional call volume and keep the customer waiting. (Expect a half-hour wait.) These numbers operate only during certain hours. The ""helper"" will encourage the caller to activate online to save on the activation fee, but will not tell you the amount of the fee.

The Web site is dysfunctional. It is difficult to determine whether a toggle is on or off, and on one page the question series will not advance to the next page because it demands a ""ContactID"" field be completed, but there is no field to fill in. At this point, their system has your credit card number, but you cannot activate the phone. BYW, there is no PayPal option.

Progress through the activation process is also halted unless the phone number for phone's primary user is supplied, but the purchaser does not have the number for the phone at that point."
B01DRV2BBY,durin,4,"Iâm not part of the target demographic, being only 23 but I wanted a simple phone so I would not be so tempted to spend all day staring at a screen instead of interacting with my friends and family. This thing delivers pretty dang well! I havenât had any issues with the coverage or poor signal. The only real complaint is that the camera is pretty abysmal so itâs probably best to save it for an emergency situation and let someone else take the pictures. Itâs also hard getting used to using the slower texting system again after being able to type so fast before. I give it a 4/5 -1 for camera. Really worth getting if you want to disconnect like me but still need a phone for work or something."
B01DRV2BBY,Kevin Tyson,2,"Purchased for my elderly mom who was in need of a basic phone. My dad has the older Samsung ""clam shell"" Jitterbug phone which he's been very happy with. Figured we'd give this one a try for mom. Having now owned and used for 6 months, here are some observations:

PROS:
1) Flip-Phone Design (easy ""open"" answer / ""close"" hang-up).
2) Big bright screen, big back-lit buttons.
3) Simple menu layout, yes/no up/down operation.
4) Loud in-call volume.

CONS:
1) Few ringer options and they are NOT very loud.
2) No vibrate option.
3) Ringer volume buttons are tiny and on the side of the phone, where your hand holds it. Easy to press and change settings if not paying attention. Bad design.
4) Just recently, the phone has been FREEZING up when using the Bluetooth option. Been having to pull the battery to reset. Finally had to give up on using the Bluetooth completely to prevent problem from re-occurring.

Overall, I would NOT recommend this phone. Jitterbug should have stuck with the Samsung ""clam shell"" phone, which is a GREAT phone and very well built. This Alcatel just feels plastic and too cheaply made. Software issues causes buggy operation when using Bluetooth."
B01DRV2BBY,Frank E,3,"Nice larger than all other flip phones, easy operation, very basic...that is what I wanted.
BUT worked for two days, then crashed, incoming calls didn't make it. GreatCalls Customer Service
tried to find the issue, they got it to work, they don't know why it happened, they are saying possible
software issue. New software will be downloaded to the phone 1 to 3 days. 3 days??? Grrr, am a bit frustrated
currently. I was kind giving it 3 stars. Will update here in a few days."
B01DRV2BBY,TheToucan,1,"This phone may have been refurbished. It did not work for my mother; I would have to hardboot it (at least it had a removable battery) to snap it out of its torpor. It locked up like this several times. Also, the menu is not as intuitive as advertised. Had to replace this after only a few months."
B01DRV2BBY,L. A. Coleman,1,"Was hoping this would work for my 85 year old mom. Unfortunately, we sent the first phone back after it stopped working. It would turn itself off and wouldn't work for awhile. Once it woke up again, it would not ring. She never knew when she would get calls!! We purchased another one hoping it was just a bad phone, but the second one did the same thing...of course this one didn't start going bad until our 30 days were up so we cannot get our money back!! The features are exactly what we were looking for, unfortunately, I think it's a software issue. It's not a reliable phone for Elderly!! Going back to Verizon"
B01DRV2BBY,Pam,1,"For the elderly you need the big numbers and letters and push buttons that respond immediately. This phone looks great, when a call is made is sounds good, but after only a month of use the circuit board does not respond to pushing the buttons. You have to push the same button repeatedly to get it connected. I thought the base rate of $14.99 per month was too good to be true. I'm going to get my mom another type of cell phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,The ring and the speaker was not loud enough... (my IPhone Is louder)! My Mom could not hear it at all. We sent it back. It seems like it's not for people with hearing and/or seeing difficulties... It's more for people who need something simple.
B01DRV2BBY,Victor J. Banis,4,"The phone is great but the buyer is required to use Great Call as a carrier, and they have lots of hidden fees. which they don't mention until you get a bill. Your personal operator (necessary for some operations like alphabetizing your phone contacts) is one charge and minutes used beyond your allowance cost .35 per minute, pretty steep. Unfortunately one goes with the other. If you are going to spring for the phone, best keep your calls to a minimum and forgo the personal operator even if it takes you longer to find a contact to call. Otherwise, I recommend t he phone highly."
B01DRV2BBY,Charlotte C.,1,"I bought this phone for my husband who wanted something very simple when his old flip phone died. This phone looks like a great idea but is almost useless. Some of the problems:
1. It's very, very slow
2. Sometimes you have to hit a button 2 or 3 times for it to register. And when it finally registers, often you see that you have 2 of that number, so you have to try to delete. It averages over a minute to get a phone number entered and to start the call.
3. Due to number 2, I suspect that even though the buttons are large, you have to hit an exact spot on the button for it to register.
As soon as I can find a phone my husband can use, this will be in the trash."
B01DRV2BBY,Janice C.,1,Person phone intended for is almost deaf and the phone did nothing to help her hearing caller.
B01DRV2BBY,Alan Crowley,5,"The PERFECT cell phone for my aging mother. The big buttons and simple operation has been easy for her to grasp. I can update her phone book remotely through the website. She quickly learned how to make and receive calls, even check her voicemail. Where working on the phone now, very easy to use. The GreatCall Link is fantastic, I have it set to alert me whenever she's moving about and I can tell exactly where she is with the GPS map feature. The phone stays almost fully charged all day, she puts in on the charging dock at night and good to go all day long. The emergency Star is a nice feature too, like a person 911 operator for her in case she gets in trouble when away from the Independent Living facility."
B01DRV2BBY,CMM,5,I got one for both of my over 70 parents. Easy to use and good customer service.
B01DRV2BBY,truthplz,3,"Got this for my 82yo father in law in early Dec 2017.

Pros: Large, easy to read numbers/text, good volume.

Cons: Build quality questionable - sometimes dial tone comes on when he opens phone up to make call, sometimes it doesnât. Sometimes when he opens up phone display doesnât light up for several seconds. Sometimes phone shows he has voicemail message and when I help him retrieve it, apparently this is no voicemail message. Many times he gets a call and it doesnât ring although he has ringer on max volume."
B01DRV2BBY,Terra,3,"Bought this phone for my senior dad who can't handle the smart phone I previously got for him. I knew it would require I sign up with GreatCall for service and was ok with that. Their plans seem reasonably priced and use Verizon network which is what works best around his home. They fail to mention on the Amazon sale page that there is a $25 activation fee for the phone with GreatCall network if you buy it from Amazon. You have to pay it to use the phone, so prepare for that when buying. The plans that seem reasonably priced are extremely basic. You have to pay extra per month for things everyone else provides free, like voice mail.

I can't attest to how well the service is or how well the phone works, because there's a lengthy setup process the phone must go through that fails for me every attempt. I called their 800 number and was told I need technical support, which isn't working right now. Will update if it ever becomes usable."
B01DRV2BBY,Robert L. Mann,2,"First let me say that GreatCall is a class A company in all respects. I have been with them for over two years with a Samsung Jitterbug flip phone. I recently up-graded ? to the new model Jitterbug, which is an annoying device. Every button you push emits a tone which is an embarrassment in public, and just plain annoying otherwise. The only way to turn the volume down also turns down the ring tone. This is not good for a senior like myself. Here is something to think about. Your house is being broken into, and you hide in a closet to call the police. BEEP, BEEP, BEEP,
(911)..........and the intruder just found you! Game over."
B01DRV2BBY,Raindrops71,1,"Bought this as a replacement phone for my father-in-law. Signal quality is extremely poor unless you're in a huge City, the volume is awful. The volume of must be on speaker in order to be heard properly and then you still have to strain. This is very poor design especially since it is for the elderly. I would not recommend this phone at all.
I wish I had kept the box so that I could return it it is a piece of crap."
B01DRV2BBY,scott,1,I bought this phone for my elderly mother. I thought it would be great especially because it had such a great rating. The phone continually had issues and just completely died! Save yourself the worry and spend a little more and get a better phone. Even a refurbished one would be better than having a loved one in a situation where they couldn't contact you.
B01DRV2BBY,Mark,2,"If your senior has hearing issues, this phone isnt for them. My dad simply cant hear it ringing, and can only (barely) hear a conversation when the speaker is on."
B01DRV2BBY,Jenny,1,"I bought this phone for my 80 year old mother for Christmas. It worked fine and was very simple to use. My complaints are that there was no way to block text messages and she would get about ten a month, which would just upset her to no end because she was charged .10 each... even tho I pay her bill for her. But now 5 months later and her phone is completely dead and will not charge. I tried her docking by station with another micro usb cord and with the cord that came with it and it will not turn on or charge. Guess Iâm out of luck and $50 since it only comes with a 30 day warranty??? Not real sure what to do now... Great Call, the phone service company refers me to where I bought the phone was was Amazon."
B01DRV2BBY,SWA_superdisp,4,"I bought this phone for my elderly Mom. It is easy enough for her to use. The cost is reasonable. The on line help and activation was fairly straightforward. I bought in New Mexico and was able to secure a Nebraska local phone number. That was my big concern.

The canned text messages are great. My Mom is sending text msg to everyone everyday and she enjoys getting a message back.

I looked at both Jitterbug and Consumer Cellular. I would have gone with consumer cellular except for the dock to charge the phone. My Mom would not be able to work the USB plug and having the dock is the one and only reason I chose Jitterbug. And I am glad. She has trouble with her fingers and she can charge the phone by setting in the dock.

My only suggestion and the only reason I dropped one star. There needs to be a way to add personalized canned texts. We wanted to set up a couple of text that my Mom and family would understand. For instance: FYI, Call when you have a chance vs Call me now."
B01DRV2BBY,Lester Ritzman,1,We got this for my husband with early dementia. The buttons didn't work and the phone was not as easy as advertised. We went back to our Trac phone and he is much more satisfied. This was a TOTAL waste of money. We HATE it.
B01DRV2BBY,curmudgeon,2,"Good: large screen, large fonts, large buttons.

Bad: LOOOUUUDDD JARRING fake dial tone sound whenever the phone is opened! Louder than anything I have ever heard from a cell phone. Mom is hard of hearing but she JUMPS in her seat every time she opens this phone! How is it possible to open this phone in a public place?
Equally LOUD, JARRING fake touch-tone sounds when number keys are pressed. These touch-tone sounds are also inconsistent: sometimes they correspond with the duration of a keypress. Sometimes they persist long after the finger is lifted. Sometimes they are delayed. They act NOTHING like an old touch-tone phone. This is so disruptive and so confusing that I can barely get through 'dialing' a number myself. I can not imagine how my mother ever does.
I guess I understand why these 'features' are there. But they are HORRIBLY implemented. IF ONLY they could be turned OFF. Or at least DOWN. But customer support says this is not possible.

Meh: yes-no menu system. Still confuses my technophobe mother. Not sure what would be better though. The ability to remove menu items she is never going to use might help. But alas, customer support says this is not possible either."
B01DRV2BBY,A. Young,2,"Just consider it a BURNER and you'll like it fine. The one I got for my 86yo mother conked out after three months, and it's not like she had been, yanno, wearing it out, dropping it in puddles, throwing it around. Verrrry gentle usage, hmm. The warranty is supposed to be a year, but is NOT TRANSFERABLE. So :::::: I gave it my mother for a gift, she got an account, she is not the original buyer, so she has no warranty. The phone is CHEAP and you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR...that is, NOT MUCH. Nevertheless, she learned how to use it JUST FINE so that part went real well, and I have just Ponied Up Again for another one. *frowns* PRODUCT UPDATE: If your phone goes BRICK, turn it over and take out the BATTERY and then put it back in. And it reboots, with all your Stuff (photos, phone directory, etc) intact. Would be, like, Real Helpful for them to put this on the danged ol' instructions. But I guesssss they'd rather have you buy a NEW one. *frowns very deeply*"
B01DRV2BBY,Lynn Heater,5,"Love it! Simple users friendly. Nice not having to talk to foreign customer service
representatives who have accents which are hard to understand. Great micorphone
and never have a problem hearing callers and callers can hear me clearly."
B01DRV2BBY,mikayla g,3,"This phone is great. BUT GreatCall, the servicer, is not my favorite. The representatives were kind and helpful, but they were a little pushy about up selling. I got this phone for my grandma and she really JUST wants it to call people in case of emergency when she is out and about. I was on the phone with them for over 30 minutes activating the phone while they tried to upsell us when we knew what we wanted. Other than that, the jitterbug is fantastic. BUT you HAVE to use GreatCall. And there are tons of fees and taxes (activation fees, taxes, etc) the $14.99/month bill turned into $24.95/ month. Just be aware!"
B01DRV2BBY,musgrovejb,3,"Excellent phone especially for an older non-technical person. Gave three stars because of the poor Jitterbug, (Greatcall), customer support. When transferring service from one Jitterbug to the replacement new phone would not work. After some basic trouble shooting was told it may take 12 hours for the new phone to activate which seemed odd.

Next day had same issue and was told by ""rude"" customer support rep that activation may take up to 3-days. With nearly 20 years in I.T. knew this was ""BS."" So insisted on being transferred to tech support. Tech support found customer support had typed in wrong phone code which caused the activation to fail. Had it active in just 5 minutes."
B01DRV2BBY,Debbie,5,Love this phone has big buttons very easy to operate. I bought this for my husband who is very happy he can use this phone without any problems. We purchased for emergency in case he was driving and his car broke down and we are happy we did would highly recommend.
B01DRV2BBY,APs,2,"Bought this simple easy to use phone for my mother. Set up was simple. Using the phone is simple. Just what she wanted. 7 days after purchase, the phone did not turn on. I tried another charger, i tried different cable, nothing worked. I went on the web for support only to find a phone number to call. I called the number and was told there was an unusually high number of calls and to call back later. 3 days in a row, 4 to 5 times a day I called and only got as far as the message. Lifeline and LifeAlert support lines get answered by a real person right away. This is what I expect. I had to look up the issue and find that removing the battery would help the phone reboot. Ultimately, customer support for a service provided to elderly should be easy to access and informative, in this case it was non existent. Trying to teach an 85 year old how to take out a battery to reboot a phone is more than anyone should expect. If the service ever improves, I will certainly update my review."
B01DRV2BBY,P. Roberts,5,"Purchased this for an older relative. She loves this phone. Couldn't work the other supposedly elder-friendly models from the telecoms, and was always calling (me) for assistance. Now she can call Great Calls customer assistance with any questions and receive fast, friendly, knowledgeable help. I've called on her behalf a couple times and was truly amazed at the high-quality customer service. The call quality is excellent, the costs are reasonable, and the billing is straightforward. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone needing a simple easy-to-use flip phone."
B01DRV2BBY,The Analyst,4,"Nice phone
Wish it had more customization options
Text size is decent but should be customizable
The first nine contacts can be automatically dialed by entering the number corresponding to their position and then pressing the YES key"
B01DRV2BBY,Rick,3,"We bought the flip phone for my sister, who has Alzheimer's. What is attractive about the phone is the fact that you don't need to use the keypad. Everything can be done with voice commands. You see, my sister can't read or write anymore because of the Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, when we got the phone the voice commands weren't turned on. We had to call to have them do that. That wasn't really a big deal. Our biggest, and constant, problem is that you really MUST turn the power off and back on at least once a week - at least. Sometimes more often. Why? Well, any computer controlled device (including smart phones) needs to have the power turned off from time to time to clear things out of it's brain. This particular phone needs to have it done more often than any device I've ever seen and the way you know it needs to be done is that when you call someone you can't hear them or they can't hear you or you can't hear each other. This puts my sister out of touch with everyone she knows and since she can't read and has Alzheimer's, she doesn't know to push the ON/OFF button and is always concerned that staff at the place where she lives just won't know how to do it, either. I live in the same town as she, but she can't call me. I try to remember to recycle power on the phone during my visits, but sometimes I forget so she'll eventually have the problem again. Great Call sent us a new phone, but it does it too. Just frustrating."
B01DRV2BBY,me,5,"Great phone to use if you are trying to keep someone off the internet but want them to have communication. And, it has the emergency button which we have not needed yet, but nice to know it is there. Also, big numbers. Even some of my son's friends have remarked how nice with the big numbers."
B01DRV2BBY,Utah Zaj,5,"We got this phone for my 85-year old mother who has dementia, hearing loss, and a host of other ailments. It works as promised: she can call me (I believe she has help as she's not able to dial a phone anymore due to her stroke a couple years ago). I love that the numbers are large and easy to read as well as the display. She can read the names in the phone book and scan through them. It's also great because it ""hangs up"" when closed so makes more sense for an elderly user. I no longer experience ""pocket-dialing"" from mom moments after a call due to this hang up feature. The last thing is that it might not ring loud enough for a severely hearing person, and with dementia, they might not remember to charge the phone, but again those are user issues, not the fault of the phone. Finally, I was impressed that the 5-star service called me pretty quickly when Mom pressed the ""emergency""number by mistake then failed to answer their call once she was silent for a minute. She's in a memory care home so was safe, but the service called me right away to ensure that mom was OK. All in all this phone does as is promised."
B01DRV2BBY,coreyh,4,"Purchased for my elderly mother who just couldn't navigate the change from her old flip phone to an iPhone. This is very easy to read and use. I have two complaints. First, it isn't compatible with her hearing aids and requires her to use an extra device. Since this product is marketed to the elderly I would expect better compatibility with hearing aids. Also, the phone book is really wonky and forces you to scroll through the contents until you get to the number you want. Seems like there should be an index which would allow you to go directly to the first letter of the name you want."
B01DRV2BBY,Mooky B.,1,"Great phone for vision impaired when it works

I purchased the first Jitterbug on January 5, 2017, when it first came out from Amazon for my mother-in-law, about three months to the service the phone started acting out (you can hear the person talk but they canât hear you), called Greatcall tech support they were baffled by the situation, the instruction was to remove the buttery and reinstall, that helped but for the next few weeks we had to remove and reinstall the buttery, after which the phone stopped working well.

We called Greatcall tech support again they decided to replace the phone with a new one, we have gone through 3 of this phone and each time the same problem.

So I decided to purchase the second Jitterbug on May 10, 2017, it worked somewhat with every so often we have to resort to removing the battery and reinstalling it, until yesterday when the phone stopped working.

So come the third phone on May 13, 2018, after mentioning my problems with the phone to the activating agent, he casually said that it is a known technology problem and that they are working on the issue. Let see it is now over a year and they have not resolved this issue.

SHEM ON YOU GREATCALL

A question asked why to buy all these phones unfortunately for elderly vision impaired person there is no other choice as of yet.

ONE NOTE: Greatcall phone service is very good and their tech-support is impeccable on the phone, unfortunately, their products are not."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"I purchased this for my 90 year old mother because it is advertised that it is made for the elderly and is easy to operate. Yes, it has large keys so they can be more easily seen, however, the ""ease"" ends there. This is an inexpensive phone so I should have known it would not be well made. I activated it last week and loaded phone numbers on it for my mother but the ""up and down"" arrows only work intermittently. It will only occasionally allow you to scroll through the phone options to get to the ""Phone Book"" or any of the other options. I have worked with it numerous times and so has my sister, thinking Mom was just having trouble getting used to it. But, none of us could get it to work on a consistent basis - sometimes it works most often it does not. My mother had a health emergency this week and the phone would not allow her to scroll to the ""Phone Book"" to get to my number and place a call to me. Luckily, she lives in an assisted living facility and they were able to contact me. I purchased this phone from Amazon and will try to return it."
B01DRV2BBY,Hanon Ondricek,1,"I bought this for my mom who is slow-learning with any kind of electronics - she doesn't use a phone much and needs to occasionally communicate with me and a few other relatives. The phone is available for emergencies and if I need to check in on her. The form factor is great, there are nice senior-friendly touches and the menus are simple and understandable. The price for just basic service is right. The MAJOR problem is that the phone tends to lock up if not used every day. Mom needs to be able to open the phone and dial on rare occasions when she needs it, but sometimes it takes up to TWO FULL MINUTES for any of the buttons to respond after the phone is opened - like it's shut down the actual phone interface to save battery life and has to reboot again. Mom doesn't understand why the buttons don't work as she expects and gives up before the phone is responsive. Since she doesn't use it unless I'm there to walk her through it after encouraging her to sit through the bootup process, she doesn't remember how anything works between uses. A phone needs to be a phone within seconds of picking it up to be useful in any respect, especially for one advertised as a ""senior phone"" with all sorts of extra subscription features for their safety."
B01DRV2BBY,Larry L.,1,The first phone that was sent would not activate no matter how many days they tried. After multiple calls to Greatcall support they send a new phone. The new phone has the wrong number so they attempt to port a number in from the old phone but apparently they can not do that because of an account number issue. Each time you have them try and do anything it takes between 24 hours and three days. Yesterday I call to have them cancel the number port and just give me a new number. They say sure it will take another 24 hours and it will be done. Today I call back to get a status and they say the person you just talked to screwed the account up and you will have to call back in 24 hours to get it fixed. I asked to speak to the manager after a little bit on hold they come back and tell me they will call me back in 24 hours. I have also been charged for service and activation on a device that cannot be used. I am trying to get this working for an elderly parent. I am so glad that I didn't send the phone directly to them.
B01DRV2BBY,Kevin Hansen,5,very awesome phone love the big screen and big buttons bigger than any other cell phone you can actually see the number that you are dialing the phone who you're calling and your texting and I really love the big red button at the bottom of the phone it is called five-star for emergencies only love the idea the price of the phone is not too bad either the price of the phone plans the amount of talk time and price is not bad either and they take the money right out of your checking or savings account if you wish but the best thing I like about it the best is no contracts so you can pay for it as long as you want one month two months whatever
B01DRV2BBY,matt,1,"I would not recommend this phone or service to anyone. The phone is cheaply made looking. The service is horrible even in a buys city. Working with customer service was a joke. They kept telling me to raise the phone in the air to see if that would help with service. What's the point in that, then you can't use the phone. I personally would not recommend this service to anyone who wants to give it to their elderly family member."
B01DRV2BBY,Deargeorgia,5,"Bought for my 97âyrâold dad who loves it. It has the loudest ring of any other phoneâand I have searched them all! Very simple to use, including the texting feature which he can manage very well. I recommend to anyone with less than agile fingers and poor hearing."
B01DRV2BBY,lewis bobb,5,"Any senior reading this review should have this phone, it is a phone, no data, no texting no computer, just a phone that is very, very easy to use and set up. You won't bump into any body, fall into a hole, or take your eyes off the road while driving. It's a phone, just talk into it. Best of all the total cost per month for 200 minutes is $20.00 with all the taxes. That's over 3 1/2 hours of talk per month."
B01DRV2BBY,upintheair,1,"While this seems like a good idea( might be if it worked) this phone is just a lump lying on a table. After 3 weeks of trying to get the phone to work consistently, I finally got a customer service rep who finally told me that the company is aware of the problem and are working on it . In the mean time they still happily collect your money.
The problem is it dosen't ring every time and even if it does both sides of the call can't hear the other side. Occasionally the phone works as advertised- maybe 1 out of 25.
Also when you activate your phone they're rude if you just want the phone, no medical. My mother is in assisted living and doesn't have need for it but it is her only phone. After the initial activation customer service good and based all in the US."
B01DRV2BBY,Bradley S. Craig,4,"I purchased this phone for my mother who suffers from macular degeneration. The phone would have worked well for her, had it been comparable with Verizon. The Jitterbug is a 3G phone and Verizon is a 4G-5G service."
B01DRV2BBY,J. Bohnen,5,"i purchased this phone for my disabled mother in law. Sheâs never used a cell phone or ever been on the internet. I read the negative comments about activation regardless I ordered the phone from amazon. The call to GreatCall was about 20 minutes long and not difficult or frustrating at all. There was an activation fee that i wasnât aware of until I called GreatCall. They recommended that I charge the phone for 12 hours prior to activation. Activation took minutes and was easy step by step process. Screen is clear and bright, colors can be changed, volumes increased. 2 great features that I wasnât aware of until i read the manual, 1. set up contacts on the MyGreatCall.com website was easy and quick. the best feature for the disabled is call the operator and tell them to call contact in phone book. amazing! For my Mother in law this phone is perfect. Also, the 5 star button gives us a sense of safety and security when she has to be alone. I shouldâve ordered this product for her years ago but I wasnât aware of it."
B01DRV2BBY,K. Debost,1,"Bought this for my husband. It's a very bad phone. You can't text with it, unless you are very patient. Sent it back."
B01DRV2BBY,MyPOV,5,"It's a little premature to write a review, but so far it seems like a great phone. I bought this for my father and he loves it. He had an iPhone before this and it was a waste of money. He is actually very savvy on the computer, but using a smart device was not his thing. It was a bit hard for him to touch the screen and navigate through menus. This Flip phone gave him all the basics he needed and the speaker is very loud. It's easy to use and very light weight. Service is easy to setup and customer service is friendly. If you need to port-in an existing number, you'll have to call in."
B01DRV2BBY,Jarod K. Boldt,1,"It's meant for seniors and as someone in their 40s, I found it hard to hear. Often had to smash the phone to my ear and plug my other ear to try and hear the person talking. Audio quality is very poor. Often people on the other side of the phone call have a hard time hearing me. Using earbuds with a microphone is usually the best choice. The phone is also very delayed when you enter commands. Pressing certain buttons, you have to wait for the phone to catch up (adjusting volume, scrolling through phone book, etc). Often it takes multiple attempts to adjust the volume. It is very delayed in notifying of texts and missed calls. I've had it where my wife texts that she is on her way home, she gets home, we talk and 10 minutes later I get her text. It will also notify me of a missed call that occurred 15+ minutes prior and the phone never rang. I had voicemail at one point, don't seem to now, but that's more of an issue with Great Call and not necessarily the Jitterbug. One nice thing is the flashlight/torch. It's very bright and very accessible. The two games on the phone are entertaining...for about 5 minutes. When texting, there is no cursor and by that I mean, if you notice you misspelled something, you have to delete everything back to that point...you can't move the cursors back to the error, fix it, and move back to where you were typing. So text slow and carefully or live with the errors. Was looking for a flip phone with no internet which is getting hard to find nowadays and this is what we ended up with. Not impressed."
B01DRV2BBY,JimmieJo,5,"Purchased for my older sister. Its simple to use and the layout is great. You can add to the phonebook online which is handy if your person is computer challenged. The service network is ""greatcall.com"" which operates on the Verizon network. I highly recommend for those who will not or can not use a smart phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Gene Blackard,5,I bought this phone for my mom over a month ago and she LOVES it. Its very easy for her to use which is a big plus because she cant operate a smart phone to save her a**. So I found this phone for her and its working perfect. Also the emergency call button is a blessing just in case something should happen when I'm working at night.
B01DRV2BBY,Darla Dyer,5,"My husband has Parkinson's Disease with Parkinson's Dementia and the phone is so good because of it's simplicity. I tried a smart phone for him and he just didn't understand how to use it as well as calling or hitting buttons and not knowing what he was doing. I also tried a flip phone from Verizon and it was more complicated than the smart phone. I looked up the Jitterbug, read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Well, my husband can actually use this phone. He gets confused at times, but it is so much simpler to use and he can't make a mistake and call someone when he didn't mean to. I highly recommend this phone for a person who is not into or does not understand today's technology."
B01DRV2BBY,billwest,5,"Absolutely no problems. I've just given up on the California Lifeline free phone. A smartphone with data. But only 5 Mb of data a month. The darn thing stuffs move updates and spam onto it than that. Storage always full and not operating. I've spent hours on the phone to India support trying to get it back running again. In comparison the Jitterbug is such a pleasure and incredible good support for a lot of thing withit. Simply gets messages and calls, loud speaker, big numbers on it's screens. That works for messages and calls. Plus a ton more elderly services if wanted."
B01DRV2BBY,farmer,4,"This is a straight forward operation phone, which I especially need since the tech scene is simply not my thing. I miss my rotary phone, okay? I like its large numbers so that I don't have to find my glasses before using it. I like the louder, clearer sound than I have experienced with other modern phones, cell or otherwise. The speaker phone gives a very clear sound so that my husband and I can have conversations with our kids together. On the other hand, our reception is constantly rated by the phone as poor, even though according to their reception map we shouldn't have trouble. We find we often are restricted while talking to sitting by a certain window. The phone does seem to need much more charging than my husband's cell phone, even when we are not using it. I find the small volume control on the side frustrating since it can easily be bumped while at the same time difficult to maneuver after being bumped. Finally, although I don't need their elaborate alert system (which costs extra) and I'm not interested in access to the internet (their smart phone), as an elderly person it sure would be nice if on this simpler phone I could nonetheless schedule a bell or beep to remind me of the time (meds, check the oven or the sprinkler, make a call, etc.) As for durability, I may have an opinion in a year or two."
B01DRV2BBY,Rodman D Cart,1,"The phone looks wonderful. But looks aren't everything..tho in this case they were since it would not function inspite of our best efforts and the efforts of two operators. one who spoke incredibly fast apparently not realizing if she had slowed to half speed everything would gone much smoother and faster
The other operator was as rapid a speaker but also had a thick accent.. Oh yes.one more thing. you go through this hassle to save 30%, sure you do, but then the phone needs activating and the activation cost brings the bill to full price again. so I was a sucker.don't be one too!"
B01DRV2BBY,nicmc,2,"the customer service sucks! I called to activate (as per instructions), and they were TERRIBLE. The girl was ditzy, and then rude. I have a typical Scottish name, and I've NEVER had to say it 3x for someone, THEN spell my 1st AND last name both, 3 times EACH (we hadn't even gotten to any of the registration details yet)! She had a nerve to get impatient, then she couldn't remotely activate my phone. After several attempts, she switched me to another dept. The guy informed me that after multiple attempts, I would now have to wait 24 hrs to call back and try activation again, as the system would need time to reboot or something. 45 minutes of time...wasted! This phone was for my 86 yr old mother, and I could only imagine the tears and frustration if it had been her. NO THANKS! I had to upgrade my own phone anyway, so I did more research and got her a similar phone on my new plan with another T-carrier. The phone is ALMOST as good as the Jitterbug, but at least a cheaper deal and much better service. The Jitterbug phone itself is REALLY great--perfect for the elderly and everything I wanted for Mom. However, you can only turn it on with their service, and for me it wasn't worth it for her (financially or emotionally)."
B01DRV2BBY,ElizabethB,5,The phone is clearly designed to be simple to use for seniors. There are a number of little details that show the thought went into the product. You need a phone contract with Great Call to use this - make sure you read the small print to see what it is included in the fees and how much extra for taxes etc will get added on to the final bill.
B01DRV2BBY,neqchis,1,"The Jitterbug Flip is intended to be a phone for seniors to use in emergencies, but it is so buggy that it ends up being less usable than any ordinary phone. Immediately after purchasing this phone, it disappointed and certainly doesn't perform like a phone should from this century.

From day one, the phone behaved like it was possessed. It froze up, spontaneously rebooted, couldn't make outgoing calls, and the ring function worked only sporadically. I've never seen a phone with so many major problems.

The phone takes a minute, maybe more to boot up to a point where a call can be made. The user interface is designed to be easy to use but my elderly parent found it more confusing than a typical tablet-like smart phone. Similar to a Ouija board, it only has YES , NO or arrow buttons to navigate through menus, but it should have a dedicated home button and X button like old 90's era flip phones that are familiar to seniors.

The battery life on the phone is abysmal, lasting only one day on standby. Even though only test calls were made on the phone, the battery died within a few months and had to be replaced. Even with he new battery, the phone randomly dies and the battery has to be removed to revive it regardless of the state of charge. One bright spot is the battery is easy to replace, but the Jitterbug manual warns owners not to replace it, as if this is a cardinal sin.

The phone has terrible reception, and shows POOR on the info screen in areas where smartphones show all bars. We haven't tested the emergency call button, but it isn't much good with all of this phones other failures. This is not a phone I would recommend to anyone, and certainly not anyone whose life depends on it."
B01DRV2BBY,Don't over think life,1,"Bought this phone for my elderly mom because they said it would work on the Verizon network and she needed a replacement phone that would be easy for her to see and use. Phone has a great design but it will not hook up to Verizon. I wanted to keep her phone number and her on my family plan and it could not be done. I spent about 4 hours over three days talking with Verizon on the phone and making multiple trips to the Verizon store because they thought it should work, but to no avail.Verizon went the extra mile to try and get it to work. Had to return the phone. Thank you Amazon for your great return policy."
B01DRV2BBY,CPearl,2,"As a senior lady who didn't need all the tricks of which my previous phone was capable I read lots of reviews and chose this. I like the large number keys, the loud speaker, and the red key to call for emergency help and I think I would be very happy if it just worked. Intermittently the light inside will not come on when I flip it open. When it does come on, the screen keeps flickering or it keeps turning completely off and on. I removed the battery to force a hard reset but nothing changed. Now I have the hassle of returning it. I'm not a happy camper. I guess I'm a grouchy granny."
B01DRV2BBY,CAMPFIRESKY,5,"I purchased this phone for my brother, who is ""technology challenged"". He has no car, no TV, no Computer and no Cell phone.... He has a land line that he can only receive calls. I took a chance that he would be able to use this (and not be afraid of it). After a lot of grumbling... he is now very comfortable with the JITTERBUG. Now he can call his friends instead of waiting to be called by someone. Customer Service at GREATCALL takes a while to get through.. but once you get a person... they have been so very helpful, patient and polite. I HIGHLY recommend this phone for Seniors. Buttons are big and well lit and the display screen is BIG so even my brother, who is blind in one eye, can easily read it. The phone itself is made with quality materials... feels good in the hand. You have an awesome product here !"
B01DRV2BBY,Grace,1,"I don't actually have an opinion about this phone because I was never able to activate it. The product information and the original Amazon representative I called said that Jitterbug would work with my existing Verizon plan. When I went to my local Verizon store, the rep tried to set it up but could not. He then replace the Jitterbug SIM card with one from Verizon but that the Verizon SIM card would not sync with the Jitterbug phone. So basically I had to return the Jitterbug and start from ground one. So, as far as I can tell, the Jitterbug does not work with an existing Verizon plan..."
B01DRV2BBY,Dennis M. Osborne,1,"Basically it's junk. Voice calling wouldn't work even after several calls to tech support. Contacts are only listed as they were entered, NOT alphabetically. You need to step through them till you find the one you want. Phone discharges quickly. Left unused all day it would be dead by the next morning."
B01DRV2BBY,never again shop retail,4,got this for my mother in her 80s. biggest dial i can find out there in the market. it comes with many options but i only needed for her to dial out. bit confusing about the plans they offer once you call to activate the line. the box says 14.99 per month but it turns out it was around 30 per month plus activation fee of $30. they told me i can down grade the plan after a month so she can only have voice call. the lower price on the box doesn't come with long distance or vm option according to the rep. no choice but to upgrade service. quality of the phone was OK. not as solid as LG or other brand name phones. sound was OK even with speaker option. for me it was all about the big dial so have to compromise on some items. i just got it so let see how it works out in few months. they also separate plans by per min so expect to pay for that as well.
B01DRV2BBY,Carla J,1,"Never turned on. Actually, bought two for my parents in their 80s. Went on line to activate, and fee after fee kept popping up. Stopped trying, and called Verizon where she had her account, she got a new flip phone. Added $6.00 to pay for phone. Has unlimited everything. Thought the Jitterbug would be a good deal. Not even close! Just remember; Even if John Walsh is on the TV telling you how great this is..... do not believe it."
B01DRV2BBY,James Comfort,4,"Got this phone for my 96 year old mother-in-law and she loves it. It has looked up a couple of times though, requiring a call to the very friendly support staff and resetting by removing the back and battery, reinstalling them and rebooting. She is very hard of hearing, but does quite well with this phone. She's learned to take pictures and receive pictures, on her own."
B01DRV2BBY,Glenn Myers,5,Large keys and screen. East to use makes the Jitterbug the best option for seniors' cell phone use.
B01DRV2BBY,Kat S,3,"I purchased this for my 90 year old mom with mid-stage dementia. It was pretty easy to use and the buttons and screen easy to read. The ring tone is way too soft, however, even at highest setting. Another design flaw is how difficult it is to seat the phone properly into charger and the connector is also very tiny. I was most unhappy with the quality of the phone (or? possibly the software). The buttons became harder to push and some of the functions quit working properly (example: it would say no voice mail message when there were messages) after 6 months of light use. I would say it's easy to use but may not last long."
B01DRV2BBY,Eleanoraxd,1,"This is without a doubt the worst cell phone I have ever had. It worked intermittently for six months, went dead and was replaced. Now it's six months later and same problem. Works intermittently and dead. It's worthless and I am now looking for a more reliable phone. What a waste of money.

I feel really bad because I convinced my older sister to purchase the Jitterbug as her first cell phone. Her phone rings frequently during the day for no reason."
B01DRV2BBY,Firene,5,"Everything about this phone is.great. It's simple to operate . My mother wears hearing aides and has no problems hearing with this phone. On the old phone she had tremendous issues with being able to hear. None of her 6 children nor her personally could enjoy a phone conversation with any of the prevoius phones she had and she tried several different phones. The Jitter Bug phone has solved those issues. Not real thrilled that she has to purchase monthly service. She uses very little of her monthly minutes and they roll over every month-old so even though she.is accumulating quite a few minutes, if you dont.pay the.monthly plan fee you won't have phone service. She could save a lot of $ if she.was able.to pay as you go. Meaning you have phone service as long as you have minutes. I would still recommend this phone to anyone especially seniors that are.not.into all the high tech features of today."
B01DRV2BBY,Kristina Phillips,2,"I purchased this phone for my 77 year old mother with the beginning signs of dementia. She loved the phones simplicity. I noticed that the signal strength is always poor, at times she can hear her own voice echo, and I have had a hard time hearing her couple of times. Talking on the phone to customer service can be a huge pain for me so I use Email. I sent an Email last week telling them about the issues and thought maybe It had a bad SIM card but I got absolutely no response from the company. Maybe they will see this message and answer my problems but the next bill is coming due and I'm not sure I want to keep this phone. I would love to update this review with a more positive one but, who knows."
B01DRV2BBY,kent,3,"Of course, this phone has many good features. Unfortunately, there is no way to block calls. In this day of robo-calling that is no longer acceptable. The phone number received from GreatCall was previously attributed to someone who had very persistent callers who didn't want to believe that the number was no longer that of their friend or creditor. The inability to block these callers was a great disappointment. We have now requested a new number and so far, so good."
B01DRV2BBY,Deanna,5,"Purchased for my 81 year old Mom. Love it - super easy to use and exactly what she needed. Large fonts, clear buttons and not complicated at all."
B01DRV2BBY,Randy B.,3,"Disappointed in the styling of the keys, especially for elderly people. I bought this for my father who suffers from Alzheimers, and because he reject most technology, giving him an iPhone was out of the question. I needed to upgrade his existing phone to one that I could GPS track, and GreatCall is the only remaining service provider that offers the GPS in a flip phone. But my issue is the usual keypad that would display a red phone for hang-up and a green phone for answer is replaced with YES and NO buttons and arrow buttons that are not as easily used to navigate as one would hope for. For the amount of monthly charges $45+ for this phone, it's leading me to research some alternative way to be able to track my dad than watch him struggle with this phone.

And for the record - my dad is in great health otherwise and takes many walks throughout the day in his neighborhood, but every now and then he'll be out longer than expected or forgets where he is. So being able to track him is extremely important. GreatCalls tracking app features are awesome and worthy of 5 stars, but the phone itself sucks."
B01DRV2BBY,Roobee,2,"The phone is okay as far as numbers, and screen is concerned. The ringtone however, is not nearly good enough for an elderly person that is hard of hearing. Even the vibration is pretty weak. For the price, I should've gotten my grandma a smartphone instead since theyr'e louder. Also there are no pay as you go plans. Only month to month, even if you don't use all 200 minutes from the cheapest phone plan."
B01DRV2BBY,GG,2,"Beware. a software problem can cause this phone to freeze and not respond to any key. this was not disclosed prior to purchase. However 6 weeks after phone was activated, it froze and wouldn't work at all. Customer service talked me through a process to reboot ( pull out battery, reinstall and then hold on button for 30 seconds.) this did work, but was advised that phone will need to be turned completely off 1 or 2 times per week to prevent it from freezing again. apparently ""they"" are working on the glitch and may come out with a fix. the big numbers on the keys and screen are as advertised. would think Great Calls should have disclosed this known problem before sale. What other surprises lurk?"
B01DRV2BBY,Heidi C,5,"Got this phone for my Mom, easy to use no very reasonably priced. Phone plan is perfect for her, she is 91 yrs young!!!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jennifer G.,5,"I bought the Jitterbug Flip Cell Phone for my 92-year old mother, and she has learned to use it! Initially we were concerned that she might just outright reject using a cell phone, but I showed her how it works and set up her phone book. She now calls me, other family members and friends!! Even when she forgets how to use a specific feature, the phone is simple enough that she can figure it out again. Really a great phone for seniors!"
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,1,"Terrible connections. AFTER buying you find out Verizon, the carrier only uses the secondary towers fr this phone. Nothing you can do to change it. So now it's a throw away and out the money!!!!!!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jean Ann Jacobs,1,"If you are a Senior it is a hassle, hard to understand....you can NOT put this phone on your current plan with ATT---TMobile etc - so don't even try.....If you want to give ALL of your personal informaton to GreatCall BEFORE you can understand their plan options....go for it.....Basically if you want to reinvent the wheel, buy this phone...."
B01DRV2BBY,Rick Wall & Janet Wall,5,"My mom - age 91 - is doing okay with Jitterbug, when she remembers where she put the damn thing."
B01DRV2BBY,TW,1,"I would give it a zero if I could. I have had all the problems others have said. I suspect this phone works well if you don't get a lemon but there are so many lemons out there it is a crap shoot.

I will be returning the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,CrankyOne,5,This is a great phone for those that don't want the fancy do everything device. Great Call is so much better than Cellular One in every way. I also get the 5 Star button that connects me to the emergency services if I need help and the first 200 minutes are included. This gives me the same as Cellular One at about the same price but works.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,"I don't know if it's the phone or the cell service but we only receive about 50% of the calls that are made to us on this phone. What I mean by that is, in only 50% of the cases, the phone rings. The other 50% of the time, the calls go straight to call history or voicemail. We've worked with Great Call customer service and, of course, they can't replicate the problem. Our other cell phone is an iPhone and we don't have this problem. Texting is also a pain - no popup keyboard. Suggestions welcome!"
B01DRV2BBY,Issac Myers,3,We have had a few problems but for an emergency phone it is not recommended. The calls sometimes fall off and there are times when the person you are talking too cannot hear you. I have had to call the help line twice and we have only had the phone a short while.
B01DRV2BBY,Chumford,4,"I bought this phone for my husband who uses a cell phone just a couple of times a year. I was trying to find one that was easy to use but also save us money. The ease of the phone is fine, but the cost advertised is increased by regulatory fees and taxes by an additional $4.03. I was replacing a Cricket phone he was using, the cost quoted was what we paid. Although there likely were these fees included, we were quoted the total correctly. I expected this phone to save us $15 a month. It saves us $10 instead. I cannot comment further on the quality of the phone as he rarely uses it."
B01DRV2BBY,Maureen Landress,5,"If you want a simple phone, not one of those do everything smart phones, than this is the phone for you. My husband hates tech stuff of any kind but he loves his new flip phone. It fits easily in a pocket, gets service dang near everywhere (he is out in the woods or on the water a lot), has nice big numbers that are easy to see, and it is soooo easy to use. Love it!"
B01DRV2BBY,readsalotofbooks,5,"Got one for my mom who is having visions problems and who has little need for a fancy iPhone. She loves it and can easily see the numbers, even with her macular degeneration."
B01DRV2BBY,HC,5,"This phone is perfect for my 80+ year old great aunt. Buttons and screen are large, high contrast, and easy to read. A plus: the phone is always asking a question (i.e. display reads ""select?"") and the buttons are ""Yes"" and ""No"" instead of the common phone buttons (select and back). GreatCall is also a really great service that is perfect for my great aunt who is still very independent and travels often. GreatCall using cell phone towers for access has been very useful multiple times. Customer service is awesome."
B01DRV2BBY,Madd 1951,2,"We bought this phone for my 96 year old mother for a Christmas gift for 2016. Great Call activated the phone the beginning of February 2017. We have had nothing but trouble with the phone itself. It keeps shutting itself off. Great call has sent us 3 new phones since February and as of today, April 20th, the 3rd phone has shut off 3 times and my mother has had it for only 1 week. Great Calls answer is pull the battery out and reboot it. Does Great Call expect a 96 year old to pull the battery out everytime, not to mention unless you look at the phone you wouldn't even know it is off. I am calling Great Call for the last time tomorrow and am ready to cancel this service. I only hope Amazon will give me a return credit on this very inferior product. If you have an elderly parent do not buy this Flip Phone."
B01DRV2BBY,jujamsamsu,5,"I like the jitter bug flip phone alot. I was able to get the plan that I wanted without all the other things included with a phone packag, such as texting, using internet storage and the five star button.If I choose to use the other ootions I can easily add them when I need them. The camera takes nice pictures an the magnifer works great for small print."
B01DRV2BBY,SPC,4,"I bought two of these for my parents, they just needed a simple phone, or so I thought. As soon as I got them activated my 88 year old dad said ""How do I put a picture on the screen like your phone?"" So far so good, I think they have actually used them once - called each other to see how they sound - otherwise they just charge all day forgotten when my parents leave the house."
B01DRV2BBY,knitter,4,My mom is finding this phone much easier to use than her other phone. The yes and no controls are easy to understand. Nice big letters
B01DRV2BBY,tposch,2,"Bought this phone for grandma in assisted living. It proved too difficult for her to use due to her mild dementia. It is probably only suitable for younger seniors with no or very little cognitive impairment. We found the Xlink product which allows you to connect an old fashioned standard dial up landline phone to a cellular network through any cell phone. Thought we could use the Jitterbug with this, but it turns out the Jitterbug phone is the only cell phone available that does not work with the Xlink, as it does not have proper bluetooth connectivity. From Xlink support -

""The jitterbug flip phone by Great Call does not dial out with the XLink.

In the last 15 years, this cell phone is the only cell phone we have come across that does not support Bluetooth HFP. This means that devices like the XLink or many CarKits cannot use it properly. It lacks the ability to dial phone numbers when the XLink wants to make a phone call with it.

We have no solution and there is no work around. We advise getting a different cell phone. We have not come across a single other cell phone that lacks this ability and it is a shocking ommision.

We strongly suggest contacting the manufacturing and registering a complaint about this.""

We cancelled the service with Great Call, and were able to use the Xlink successfully with an old Moto X phone."
B01DRV2BBY,G. Reynolds,2,"The display is bright and the phone book function works well. However, there are issues with the ringer. It only has 3 volume settings and the loudest setting isnât that loud. The ringer also seems to cut out and basically has a poor sound quality. Also, the buttons on the side that control the volume are too easily pressed when you use the phone and there is no way to lock the sound level in. This is a fatal flaw as far Iâm concerned and I would not recommend this phone because of these issues."
B01DRV2BBY,Donald Rezendes,4,Good service for an older guy like me. Some are cheaper but $30 a month for 600 minutes and 200 texts aint bad. Ya get the emergency button for that too. I broke my ankle this last Christmas sure wish I had this.
B01DRV2BBY,jarles alberg,1,"Don't be fooled into thinking your carrier will support this phone. I gave my mom my old Samsung phone, and she had trouble learning how to use it, so I decided to get the famous ""Jitterbug."" I bought it through Amazon and after reading the information I was led to believe that I could add this phone to my current Verizon phone plan. After several hours of phone chat, changing SIM cards, etc. I was finally directed to go to the Verizon store, which I did. This phone will not work with Verizon. Do not be fooled into thinking you can use Verizon as a carrier for this phone. This is part of one of the answers I looked at to decide to get this phone... All Jitterbug cell phones and smartphones are unlocked per nationwide standards, but we cannot control which carriers choose to accept or activate our phones. In this day of Amazon giving consumer ratings, I am amazed that they do not tell you that you can't use a company as huge as Verizon. If you have any existing phone plan, don't assume your carrier will support the Jitterbug. While I was at the Verizon store, I bought a flip phone from Verizon for a trade in on my Samsung, and spent a little more money. The worst part for me is the wasted 10 hours of ordering, dealing with and eventually sending this unit back. Hopefully I won't waste more time."
B01DRV2BBY,Daniel Tamura,1,"Overall, a bad phone for elderly folks. First of all, if you're going to make a device for seniors, make it loud. The ringer, the speakerphone, everything should be audible to old ears. Next, there's the dock. Horrible design. The phone never feels like it's securely docked. We ended up just plugging the cord straight into the phone itself. Then there's the UI. Complicated, non-intuitive. It takes multiple keystrokes just to see how much charge is left on the battery. The big buttons are a great start, but Jitterbug really should have put more thought into the design of this device."
B01DRV2BBY,Clark,5,"I bought it as a Christmas gift for my mom and she really enjoys it. If you are looking for a phone to mainly make calls or send texts, have issues with smart phones; or just want a simple, easy-to-use phone, this is a great solution. Takes decent quality photos as well. Simple to set up and use."
B01DRV2BBY,Gerald Burgie,1,Worked for only 3 months. Dead and buried waiting for return service request.
B01DRV2BBY,Cherl Christensen,1,"Not tracpone. Great call may be good, too expensive for my buget. Wish Amazon could create a red star for do not purchase"
B01DRV2BBY,Ann Fico,1,"it died after a month. it was impossible to contact them by phone. I could reach no one..not even to cancel plan.
i cannot believe john walsh is connected here. the people were actually rude. there should be a NO STAR NOT ONE STAR."
B01DRV2BBY,Jay,1,"This phone is either defective, or just a piece of junk. It will not consistently work, and the buttons occasionally stick. I'd buy a better phone that can be relied on."
B01DRV2BBY,"oklahoma, for me!!",1,"I disliked the tone of voice and the manner in which I was treated by the call center young man. He was sharp, impatient and severe...not someone you would expect to help an elderly person....which is why I bought the phone. I am very upset by my treatment and have called Amazon to let them know how I feel."
B01DRV2BBY,Sir Nigel,1,"Very poorly made. Worked OK the first 50 days or so, then the keypad stopped working correctly, the ringer stopped working, so all calls to me went to Voicemail. They don't allow returns after 30 days and No Customer assistance after 60 days. Bought directly from Amazon. The charger died less than 2 weeks after I got it and the phone wasn't far behind. GreatCall is your ONLY carrier option with the jitterbug phone, which is also a problem."
B01DRV2BBY,dave,5,"Very good simplicity for tech challenged seniors. Mom's vision is not what it used to be and the large font size is very helpful. Good device and good ""Great Call"" service plans. I was most impressed by the Great Call operators who actually spoke english with an American accent and were very friendly and helpful."
B01DRV2BBY,PAUL ALDRED,5,"GOING ""BACK TO THE FUTURE"" FROM MY ""SMART"" PHONE, I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE ""JITTERBUG""!!! IT DOES EVERYTHONG I NEED, USING A VERY USER-FRIENDLY FORMAT!!! ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES SIMPLICITY!"
B01DRV2BBY,PAUL G.,5,"I purchased the Jitterbug Cell Phone for a 85 year old partially blind friend of my wife and I. It is everything that she wanted and is quite pleased with it. She has had it for several months now, no functional problems, large keys, easy to see and illuminated to help. Best of all, it's affordable for someone on limited finances. She has easily mastered listing contacts and enjoying the user friendly operational system. I know she would recommend it here but does not have computer access and so I am doing it for her."
B01DRV2BBY,Kaleb,3,"I bought this phone for my Mom--I had to return it because after a couple of weeks, the phone would no turn on. Amazon was fantastic in sending me a second phone however, the phone has issues at times where there is trouble in hearing the person. To be fair, it could be the GreatCall service which is the service that is required to be used with phone. The functionality of the phone is great and it is very user-friendly! Works great for seniors!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"Everything was great until I tried to activate. Setup auto pay and I noticed a $25.00 activation fee!
This fee is not disclosed in any of their marketing information. Called to complain and they correctly told me it is disclosed in the fine print on the tab of the box!!
I also discovered that incoming calls are charged to your minute allowance. A 14.99 charge could easily be replaced with a 100.00 to $200.00 charge and with auto pay would not notice until I reconcilled my accounts.
I am planning on returning to Amazon as it is misrepresented and misleading."
B01DRV2BBY,"Pete Stone, Owner",2,"Although reasonably simple to set up and use by seniors, the one BIG FLAW is the stupid placement and operation of the side volume buttons! Why they didn't realize that seniors don't notice these buttons, and by merely holding the phone in their hand would accidentally turn the ringer volume completely off surprises me! I got one for my mother, and although we showed her how to use the phone and how to use the volume buttons, we constantly find that just holding the phone...she is pushing the volume down so far she can't hear it ring. Good job Jitterbug! What they REALLY NEED is a way to LOCK THE RINGER VOLUME."
B01DRV2BBY,Suzi J. Burkhardt,5,"Got this for my mom after failing with several smart phones for her to remember how to use it. This has a very simple setup, large print, and my mom's been calling friends and family non-stop since getting it. I also love the affordable monthly plan options, her's is at the most basic and is only $14.99 per month."
B01DRV2BBY,m bagrowski,2,"I bought this Jitterbug phone for my elderly mother but returned it. The phone has large numbers and probably works Great Call describes it, but the lowest cost monthly minute plan through Great Call is $25 per month ($300/yr.). My mother stills uses a landline and only uses a cell phone in case of emergency. I went to Walmart and got her a Tracfone that had a speakerphone. Annual minute plans are much less expensive."
B01DRV2BBY,Parita Puri,1,"Jitterbug/greatcall is built on the verizon network. Do not expect T-mobile OR sprint to work on this phone. They advertise the phone to be unlocked, but you can't even turn it on without it trying to go through the set up process. Thus not allowing you to check network connectivity, or utilize the phone in any manner.

the product has a lot of potential, but the false advertisement and horrible customer service is why i'm rating it a 1 star."
B01DRV2BBY,terracatta,1,"I bough this as a back-up because my real phone (Samsung Smartphone) gave up the ghost after 4 years and I haven't replaced it yet. I dislike this phone intensely. It is a ""dumb"" phone. It's a good thing I have my tablet and laptop.I hate having to press yes or no for everything but at least I can make phone calls which my defunct phone can no longer do. You won't believe (yes you will) that even with the new phone number I am getting robo calls. OMG!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,I bought this for my elderly parents with the understanding that they would be able to add it to their Verizon plan. Verizon refuses to help them in any way. The return window closed on this purchase as my parents live a distance away and I just retrieved the phone. Iâm very disappointed in this purchase! Want to return so it might work for someone else! Customer service at Jitterbug was great. But canât use phone as intended with current carrier.
B01DRV2BBY,ChristineDux,5,"My husband is 80 and completely defeated by his Virgin Mobile smartish phone. The Jitterbug Flip does many fewer things, which makes it a much better fit for his needs. Customer service at Virgin Mobile, his previous carrier, was nonexistent, and he was always very frustrated by his phone and their lack of help. The GreatCall customer service is outstanding: a sentient human answers the call on the first ring and treats us with respect and concern. I could not be happier with this change."
B01DRV2BBY,Jeanio,5,"We have had a Jitterbug phone for many years and love it...especially my husband who is high tech phobic! Recently we decided to get rid of our landline and so bought another updated Jitterbug for me. I love it! It is easy to use , is very attractive in its red case and serves our low tech needs. Thnak you for making it available. I highly recommend the Jitterbug!"
B01DRV2BBY,BB007,1,"Its not a Samsung anymore, its some off brand. Lousy quality - kept freezing up requiring numerous restarts. Very frustrating for my dad - we returned it"
B01DRV2BBY,Juanita Yates,5,"The phone is very simple to use. I had to call Jitterbug three times to set it up and I was so happy that EACH TIME I CALLED, I got a person who spoke English and I could understand them plain and clear. Thank you for that. It is VERY FRUSTERATING TO CALL WHEN NEEDING HELP AND YOU CAN NOT UNDERSTAND A THING THE PERSON IS SAYING. IF A PRODUCT IS SOLD IN AMERICA, THE HELP SHOULD BE IN PLAIN ENGLISH."
B01DRV2BBY,Colorado Gal,5,"We purchased this for our daughter who specifically wanted a ""red"" phone. As she is challenged this phone with its emergency button was especially what we needed for her. It is working just fine. Love the docking station and so does she."
B01DRV2BBY,J.C. Gleason,2,bought this for my mom but its not the great product its cracked up to be. The buttons are big enough and the instructions are dubious at best. Still trying to find out how to delete a number from phone book.
B01DRV2BBY,David Arnott,5,good price easy to set up and use
B01DRV2BBY,Cindy McCaughey,1,"The phone is great but when you go to get service from ""Great Call"" that is an entirely different story. I tried for FOUR HOURS to get the phone to activate. I called the company - and sat on hold forever - THREE times and THREE different people gave THREE different reasons why the phone wasn't setting up properly. The last one tried to convince me that the phone wasn't yet activated - even though the first two people told me it was and I had called the number from a landline - one told me it wasn't charged - it was, I certainly know how to tell if a phone is charged - and one told me that the service wasn't strong enough in my area to set the phone up ... see, according to her, the service has to be stronger service to do the set up, but that my 89 year old father would get service after that???!!! What the heck? Like I have never activated a phone before? I blew up and cancelled everything and returned the phone. A great phone is of no use if you can't use it. I went to Verizon at the last minute and got my dad a phone that worked so his birthday was not a total bust."
B01DRV2BBY,John Shoup,1,"It doesn't work and 45 days later, I can't return it. Thanks Amazon"
B01DRV2BBY,Christopher J. Rankin,5,"Durable, very good coverage, easy to learn and use, good clear sound and volume, safe in pants pocket, didn't want internet access on cell phone, had 6 other cell phones w/TracFone but this jitterbug and the Verizon service is far superior. Verizon only provider that covers my home area and most everywhere else. I am now a happy camper. TracFone customer service in a state of decline. Was with them 10 years until now."
B01DRV2BBY,Pamela Johnson,1,"The Jitterbug phone was not suitable for use with the phone systems used in New Zealand . A fact that I was unaware of when I purchased the phone. I found this out after spending many hours trying to have it set up, to no avail. The fact that the phone could only be used on a USA phone net work system was not mentioned in the information given. I have returned the phone and I am waiting for reimbursement"
B01DRV2BBY,Sacto Girl,5,"The Jitterbug phones are great. My husband uses his and he's not techie. Simple, easy to use phone. It's that simple."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"Bought this for my 92 yr old mom. She has learned to operate it easily and got rid of her house phone. It is easy to charge, easy to handle, and, at least, we have peace of mind that she can call for help if she falls or needs assistance. She doesn't use texting, so her monthly bill is quite manageable for her."
B01DRV2BBY,FloridaSunshine,4,"Ordered this for my Mom (92). She had the older version of the same phone and we expected this one to work the same. Unfortunately, it did not. Something was haywire with it and it was frustrating to my Mom that is scared of new ""gadgets"". I contacted Amazon and was able to return it and order a second one that seems to be working like it should. Thanks to Amazon Customer Service!
Kudos to Jitterbug customer service also for helping to set up both phones."
B01DRV2BBY,John Hedley,2,"Not very easy to use by my elderly father, which defeats the purpose of getting it. Setup is complicated, even for a tech-savvy person and routinely fails, requiring a call to their customer service and an extra charge. The ringer is NOT loud enough for people who are hard of hearing. Since very few similar cell phones exist that are designed for the elderly youâre pretty much stuck with this dog. Itâs strictly for emergencies. Too much trouble for my dad to use as a regular phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Haydenks,2,Phone was DOA
B01DRV2BBY,M. Shinn,3,"In the description for the Jitterbug, it said it works on the Verizon network. We have Verizon as our service provider so I thought it would work for my disabled husband, however IT DID NOT WORK.

I had to return the phone to Amazon. Their return policy is amazing, very easy to do."
B01DRV2BBY,N.C.,3,"Fantastic phone for most elderly. A few design improvements could make it a lot more friendly for ""low vision"" customers. My grandmother is finding is extremely difficult to use with her macular degeneration. The firmware was well thought out but the hardware and service leave a lot to be desired for low-vision. The buttons run together with minimal distinction to be able to hit buttons by feel. More prominent buttons with physically distinctive raised characters would really help a lot. If you have great sensitivity in your fingers you can feel your way through but the tactile experience is NOT adequate for aging fingers.

Because service for this devise is restricted to only the one company, with no other choices, a few comments on the service are equally relevant to this product review. In this case, the manufacture, service provider, and seller are all one and the same:

Customer service is a real pain. If the account holder is not the same person as the end user, prepare for endless frustrations. If you want to have an account where you manage devices for multiple family members, forget it, they don't allow that. You have to actually create a separate email, if you don't already have one, and run completely separate accounts.

The operator assisted dialing is almost a total waste, you actually have to call customer service so wait times can be long and after-hours takes forever. Operator assistance should actually be an operator, NOT an extra rout to customer service. Worse yet, they keep calling my grandmother by my name.

This company has some good potential but they need new management that can actually make logical choices and get them back on the right path. Hopefully they will get their act together some day."
B01DRV2BBY,cwbuff,5,"I bought this for 87 year old mother who lives in an assisted living facility. The quality of the phone is excellent. The network works well where she lives. I was looking for a simple phone that she could use with no cumbersome menus or even voicemail. This phone produces a dial tone when open and hangs up when closed. She uses the speed dial. All she has to do is open the phone, press a number to display the person to call and press the big yes button. I did not use any of the other features which cost a few extra dollars which would be useful for elderly people living alone. The only thing I don't like is the inability to add this to my ATT family plan."
B01DRV2BBY,Diane K.,5,This was a replacement for my stepdad's old Jitterbug. It has larger buttons and is so much easier for him to use/see. I was upset at first because I was told that a lanyard could not be used with it. Upon closer inspection I found a place for the lanyard at the top left. It's a must for him since he is wheelchair bound and in a nursing home and impossible to keep up with otherwise.
B01DRV2BBY,Maribel,2,"The phone itself is great for its large buttons and screen. However the volume control for the ringer or in-coming calls isn't sufficient at its loudest setting. Also, it was disappointing to find after the fact that voicemail isn't included in the monthly service fee."
B01DRV2BBY,jeffrey d seppala,2,Did not work right out of the box. sent it back for a refund.
B01DRV2BBY,Bryant Shockley,2,"nice looking phone, its clear easy to read and use. When I tried to use Bluetooth with the car it paired up, could not call out or receive calls. The phone would freeze up. had to remove battery to reset the Phone. If u are using the phone around the house its alright. Its not that good when it will not work in your car with the Bluetooth system"
B01DRV2BBY,rdav5135,5,"Basically, this is a easy to use phone with large buttons and large display. It is perfect for seniors that just want a simple phone or cannot figure out how to use a smart phone. The emergency call button built into the phone is a wonderful feature to have. Great Call is friendly to work with for activation and customer service.
Two things to know. Although there are no contracts or cancellation fees, activation is through Great Call and them only. While the Jitterbug phone itself is relatively inexpensive (depending where you buy it), the monthly level of activation plan is where things can get expensive.
So far, mom is happy with the phone... and that says it all."
B01DRV2BBY,Fiona V.,5,"I bought this for my mother because it is nice and basic, easy for my mother to operate. Excellent customer service, too. The woman on the phone was infinitely patient and empathetic when my mother was having difficulties because she freaks out over anything technology-related. It doesn't get any more simple than this."
B01DRV2BBY,K. Trebesch,5,Got this for my 90 year old mother who is a bit hard of hearing. She can use it with or without her hearing aids and has learned most of its functions on her own without the manual. Successful purchase in my case.
B01DRV2BBY,Janet G,4,Got this for my Mom and she really does like it. She can hear much better then her old phone! The customer service for the phone is particularly good. Those folks have a lot of patienceð
B01DRV2BBY,DocJr,5,"Bought this and a Jitterbug for my mom's 85th birthday. Over the last couple of years she's been falling after breaking a hip.
She also has poor hearing and vision. Never usually picked up the phone, prompting someone going to check on her and not knowing if she was alive or not. So, so scary and stressful.
Now I can reach her any time. We also have the added piece of mind that she has 5 star!"
B01DRV2BBY,D Holmes,1,Phone worked for sort time then failed to ring. Called Greatcall customer service. They told us to just turn the phone off and back on. It worked initially but quite ringing. Called again. Went through all the trouble shooting. It again quit ringing. Called again told them we wanted a new phone. They agreed but wanted to charge us for shipping. They said they would not charge us after I said I wasnât happy about that. New phone. Reactivation and worked for a short time and quit ringing. Not happy with this phone.
B01DRV2BBY,lilprincess,5,"I absolutely love this phone. The buttons are large, the screen has large numbers and letters on it and it is very simple to use. I am very happy with it and really glad I got rid of my touch phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Hijinx79,3,"You cannot add this to your Verizon wireless plan as others said. I called Verizon plus went to two separate stores each trying without luck of activating on Verizon. Phone itself is ok, easy for Grandma to use but charging dock is finicky to get phone to charge as it has to sit just right."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,Easy to set up. I do wish the volume control was not on the side of the phone. When my mother holds her phone she presses on the volume button while holding it. So then she had no volume but she canât understand how to fix it with her dimentia issues. Do..... she canât hear her phone ring because she turns the volume down. You canât talk into this phone whiteout holding onto the sides. Just another problem for the elderly.
B01DRV2BBY,debbie krause,5,This phone is perfect for my 83 yr old Mom. She has limited eyesight due to Macular Degeneration but these numbers are big enough for her to see.
B01DRV2BBY,Mrs. D.,3,"I have had this phone for 9 months and a bit disappointed. The cradle charger no longer works, and the when turning the phone (on or off) it takes quite awhile to respond as does putting in a new phone number to call someone who isn't in my phone book. It would be nice if accessories for this phone were be a bit easier to locate. ( Would I purchase this phone again?) Probably not."
B01DRV2BBY,HPitkoff,1,"Since purchase this phone has never worked ...not for calling out or for receiving calls. This is serious since we are seniors and
need working phone. Have spoke to representatives two or three times to no avail. Terrible experience for months.
Watch out...."
B01DRV2BBY,Loretta Carroll,2,"The phone is of good quality, but you will not be able to use the phone with your own carrier. You will have to use the service provided with the phone. Ordering a sim card from your own provider will not work - believe me."
B01DRV2BBY,Larry Stanley,1,"They don't tell you that you cant use your own cell provider to save money, the sim card is programed to use there provider only. buyer beware, many hours on the phone to try to make work, waste of money"
B01DRV2BBY,Jolene K Otomo,2,"Very easy to call someone but i do want voice dial for future use loosing eyesignt, and havent had much luck getting it when Calling . The text messaging is awful. Feels like i stepped back in time 20 years its real time consuming to type a message. Not sure i want this phone now, i send a lot of texts to my grandkids and with this phone I will probably get mad and toss it. I like the large letters and will keep it for future use. Get a smsrt phone next time."
B01DRV2BBY,Carolyn Hartzler,2,"My husband is 86 years old. He has used a flip-phone for years. Since flip-phones seem are getting close to extinct, and he needed new phone ... we tried Jitterbug Flip. We wanted a quality flip-phone. We got that. The phone is of great quality. However, for someone who is familiar with using a cell phone, it is so simplified it is agonizing. He has to answer about a half dozen questions to accomplish what he could have on another flip-phone done with a couple taps on the key pad. So..this phone is for someone who has no idea how to use a cell phone. It is NOT for someone who is familiar with one, Great quality. Otherwise, frustrating."
B01DRV2BBY,Caroline Moskwa,1,Never opened it. Misleading about wether it was unlocked. I wanted a phone that was notre-paid
B01DRV2BBY,Al Leisure,4,The Jitterbug I purchased for my wife is perfect with the S5 care button and flip to answer and close to hang up. I am planning on setting up the link to my phone and our daughter so that if she uses the care button we will be notified. The two things that keep me from 5 star rating is the monthly cost for minutes and the fact you are charged for incoming calls by the minute as well as out going.
B01DRV2BBY,MICHAEL SHACH,1,"I am totally dissatisfied with this product. The phone would not activate and I spent over 2 hours on the phone with""great call"" reps trying to get it working. 5 of the 8 reps I dealt with were less than adequate, the others were fine to work with, just ineffective. They are sending me an activated phone that I should have in 2 days. I bought this phone for my 85 year old father. Thank goodness I had it sent to me instead of him. He would have been a basket case going through what I went through. Friendly people for the most part, inferior product for sure."
B01DRV2BBY,I Wonder 3902,4,"Great style phone. Bought for my 89 year old father because of the thin profile, large buttons, and emergency button. Sad part is I am not able to use it with my provider. Shame would have helped him very much. Too much trouble to convince the old-timer to get a new phone number and add another service to my bills. I highly recommend it if it's the only phone in your plan or if your elderly family member is willing to change numbers"
B01DRV2BBY,Joseph Normile,2,"Item was stolen from me, Iâm sure it should have done what it was intended, I have a Samsung S6 working great. I bought the Jitterbug for an elderly neighbor,
Who broke his Iâve fallen and I canât get up. Button, the
Jitterbug should have solved his problem. Regards Joe N."
B01DRV2BBY,Jim Corpora,4,"Got this for my Mom, so far so good. Customer Service was friendly when I contacted them. About the only thing I don't like is it doesn't put your contacts in alphabetical order, so you might want to write them down how you want them."
B01DRV2BBY,Victoria,5,My dad is not tech savvy but needed a cell phone. He gets AARP mag and I saw this shown in an issue. Ordered it and so far so good. I love that he has phone numbers at a click and can contact a service that has all his medical information if something happens to him and I am not home. I love that the numbers are massive and simple to use.
B01DRV2BBY,T. Doster,1,"1st phone quit working camera and magnifier function. Received replacement phone and its ring volume didn't work. vibrate worked though...
Not reliable. Will return the phone but no replacement.2nd time."
B01DRV2BBY,JASON H.,1,"Bought this for my grandmother to keep with her when she leaves the house but because it lags and freezes and has to have the battery removed to unfreeze it, it is basically unusable and she might as well not have a cell phone at all! Piece of junk, useless phone. On the rare occasion that needs to be used the thing is always frozen up and unresponsive to any buttons. Waste of money because I can't return it now."
B01DRV2BBY,Mona G.,5,"My mom really likes having her own cell phone. Easy to use and has all the features she
needs and more."
B01DRV2BBY,C. Corcoran,4,"Got this phone for my mom age 84, hearing not great and wanted to get away from landline costs of $60+. She's at a assisted living facility so the phone is her lifeline to the outside. I might not have read all the info on site but when I called to activate there was a $25 or $35 charge from great call. $25 if you do online or $35 if phone assisted. There is an activation charge regardless of who you buy from. Two negatives- if you have voice mail the phone might only ring 3-4 times before it goes to voice mail and volume of ringer not that loud even turned up to max."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,We couldn't get it to work-the people at Jitterbug were great to work with-we just couldn't get a product to work. Within days we had a refurbished product rather than the original new phone and couldn't get it to work either. We have been assured no charges will be incurred-so far that has been correct! It was worth a try.....not helpful in the rural area where we live.
B01DRV2BBY,celli,5,"This is 2nd Jitterbug for my husband who is extremely hearing impaired. He likes the phone. Can hear well on it. Likes larger numbers/letters for easier dialing and text messaging. Voice mail recording is a confusing for him but I think any phone would be.

No complaints. It's certainly a lot easier to use than a smart phone."
B01DRV2BBY,C. Saylor,1,"I ordered this phone for my husband primarily for the ease of use and large buttons and display. We had problems with it almost from the beginning. Buttons began to stick and not respond, phone would not turn on all the time and we would have to try multiple times in order to get it on, no call waiting, you cannot view missed calls unless the number is on your contacts list. I really could go on and on. It became so frustrating we have already thrown it away and replaced. Do not recommend it to anyone."
B01DRV2BBY,Paul,2,I got the phone for my mom (she asked for it by name) and when I call her I am very disappointed with the voice clarity. It may be the area she lives in but the coverage map say her area gets very good coverage.
B01DRV2BBY,David Blake,5,"was going to get this phone for my grandmother to use. as great and easy as this phone is and looks what the description doesn't say is that its ""unlocked"" with limits. anyone who is going to use the phone I would check with your phone service to first see if its compatible before you buy. had to return because of this, a disappointing decision I had to make. I have T-Mobile"
B01DRV2BBY,Diane McGee,5,The first cell phone my husband has been able to use... thank you Jitterbug
B01DRV2BBY,Lisa,3,"Difficult to charge, needs to be placed in the cradle just right or it wont charge! Charging without the cradle is very difficult for senior's"
B01DRV2BBY,Eva Butman,1,did not cost to use it the price it was advertised at--not $19.99--more like 39.00$/month
B01DRV2BBY,Tonya,2,I had purchased the phone for my mother as a Christmas present. My mother had been having trouble with the phone. When I was saving numbers on the phone the button sticks. When she tried to dial a number and scroll the menu to check her call history the button sticks. Her phone also has a bad signal. She would like to return the phone and cancel the service. It's giving her a hard time.
B01DRV2BBY,Beto Hinojosa,3,Bought this for my elderly father. When I call him his voice sounds very muffled (poor). It does not have a battery life indicator so you need to go into the settings to see it (poor).
B01DRV2BBY,R Koite,2,"On Flip Phone from Amazon $35 to Activate $10 if you buy from them. Plus there in more they will start @ $15 for 200 min + all the taxes & surcharges. They will run up the cost with voice mail, texting plans & more mins. A normal cell plan is around $65."
B01DRV2BBY,TheUbe,3,Was a great phone for a year...slowly the buttons are not responding like they did new. Occasionally multiple presses are required to scroll the menu. My mom uses this and not on the phone much. Just expected it to last way longer.
B01DRV2BBY,Lynda Palmieri Klemer,5,My dad is 80+. He has never used a cell phone until I bought him a jitterbug. He calls it a litterbug (he's bourder line losing it). The point is .... He loves it and won't part with it. Finally he has embrassed a form of technology. Whoa hoo
B01DRV2BBY,Robert,5,"I got this for my aging parent. She has fallen a few times, I like that she has a service to call for help. She really likes the phones big numbers and the volume."
B01DRV2BBY,Pat McDaniel,5,"Easy to use! Got it for my ""not computer savvy"" husband."
B01DRV2BBY,Rebecca Hernandez,1,"I bought this phone for my elderly father and while we loved the size of the buttons and the ease of use, the sound quality was lacking. Even at top level he (nor any of us) could hear the speaker well and the phone did not ring very loudly. For the target audience of elderly customers we were disappointed. We tried to work with it for several months and missed the return date. I would not recommend for folks who need the ringer and voice function to be loud. This phone was actually quieter then a regular flip phone which we went back too!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,all that I need
B01DRV2BBY,DD,3,"Purchased for a relative. Sometimes when she's talking, her voice goes silent to the person on the other end for 10-30 seconds. When she calls, another person's name appears on the recipients' Caller ID. And the Voicemail doesn't work right."
B01DRV2BBY,Cassi,2,"When my mother began having problems with her cell phone and wanted something simpler, she began noticing all of the GreatCall advertisements. She thought that it would be very simple to use and make her life easier. After signing up for the service which cost much more than it was advertised she found that the phone, while simple, was not intuitive as it originally seemed. There was no way to set alarms, so you had to opt in for a medication management service that would call and bug you to take your medicine. The support was atrocious and they were not friendly. On top of it, the phone stopped working in the first week. Their technical support didn't even try to help, but instead tried to sell another phone."
B01DRV2BBY,S. Matthias,1,Phone did not work. Jitterbug Customer Service could not resolve problem. Returned phone immediately. Plan is advertised to senior citizens - but it is expensive for limited features. You need to pay more for something as basic as voice mail. Phone clunky. Hard to flip open for a senior. Not at all intuitive.
B01DRV2BBY,Janell Combs,5,"Great phone but when we went to activate someone else had already previously done so, took a little extra time contacting customer service to correct the problem but worth it. My mother says it is easy to use, enter contacts and large numbers are perfect for entering numbers, but you do have to pay extra for added services such as messages."
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,5,"This red jitterbug was purchased for my 91 year old mother. It is easy to use, understand, and is chic... she has vision issues, so it has made her ability to call family so much easier. Great little phone... and a great price as well. Much less expensive and much better use."
B01DRV2BBY,Donnie Kay,4,"After having a Smartphone for several years, it was becoming increasingly difficult for Mom to understand how to use the ""swipe"" feature. She would tap too hard or push on the screen, finding her efforts mainly unsuccessful & frustrating no matter how much I tried to teach her how to use the touchscreen. Her eyesight is also failing so she was pleased to receive the Jitterbug with the easy to see number pad, large text, the fact that it flips on or off. The reason for 4 stars is that we live in a newer area in a big city & the signal strength is consistently poor in the house. I was down the street at the neighbors and our call dropped twice in less than a minute, so frustrating. I will contact customer service to see if there is a resolution to that issue."
B01DRV2BBY,GingerB,1,Need to return phone. Won't turn on. Had three months.
B01DRV2BBY,Ruth Hill,1,"This ""Jitterbug Flip Easy-to-Use Cell Phone for Seniors"" phone hasn't worked since we got it. My mother hasn't been able to even place a call out. We've also received messages from people we don't know and there are photos of someone's vacation, photos we did not take. I'm ready to throw this in the trash."
B01DRV2BBY,Lisa,5,My mom 74 years old and she loves this phone they're big buttons it's basic phone talks and text the issue is is you have to pay $15 a month for the basic phone service and then you have to pick a service of so many minutes a month or unlimited so with the basic I have was $15 and then the unlimited talk came out to $56 a month talk text
B01DRV2BBY,William V Fazio,5,wife's first cell phone.... she's 88 yrs old and likes it... very easy to use
B01DRV2BBY,Smokey Brown,5,"We have had our Jitterbug for 2 months now, and we wonder why we waited so long to get one. We just need the phone for sending and receiving phone calls and texts. The Jitterbug does this slam dunk with no hassles and no headaches. It simply WORKS. I love the word ""simple"". We are sold. Not a single problem. Just satisfaction."
B01DRV2BBY,MP,5,"I purchased this for my Mom (90 y/o; hard of hearing) when her old flip phone finally died. Sorry I didn't purchase it earlier. It's very easy to read, easy to use and the sound - esp the speaker - is excellent. Despite being tech averse, she learned to use it in an hour."
B01DRV2BBY,nick,3,It would be fine for a younger senior who is a little used to technology but my 98 year old sister in law cannot handle it. There is just too much things available and it blows her mind. Some seniors need just a plain flip phone.
B01DRV2BBY,JoJo,4,"Shipping took way longer than expected. For a senior this is a good phone although service is expensive for phone minutes. Have not used the 5Star feature yet for service. I was not happy with features that were listed in the instructions, Voice Dial, which were not active on my phone. I called the company but to date I don't have voice dial active."
B01DRV2BBY,Laura,3,My 90 year old Mother likes it better than her old cell phone. We makes and answers calls on it. Has other options like a camera that she wanted but has not used as yet. The monthly fee is about double what you see in their advertising by the time you sign up for service but it includes emergency assistance which so far she has not had to use.
B01DRV2BBY,ajn27511,1,This phone is a replacement for the one that failed. This phone has to get rebooted at least once per day in order for it to operate properly.
B01DRV2BBY,Dan,5,great price good phone or elderly visually impaired this new jitterbug flip doesn't come with a starp holder recommend buy a case my mother wears around neck
B01DRV2BBY,K. Koonce,1,Service from provider horrible! Would not recommend to anyone!!!! Huge rip-off (I returned phone and got my money back from Amazon)
B01DRV2BBY,Kreegs LKreger,4,"Simple cell phone that does a lot of stuff for the money. Great for someone who doesn't need a smart phone, such as an older person like me."
B01DRV2BBY,Robin Sedgwick,5,"My dad loves his updated Jitterbug. The screen is much bigger and easier for him to see. He will not be texting or taking photos, but it pleases him immensely."
B01DRV2BBY,Robert P,5,Got this for my 90yr old grandfather and he can actually use his phone again. We tried to give him a touch screen phone and that was a big fail. He had another flip phone and had trouble doing anything with it except taking making phone calls. Now he can read messages and take pictures. Screen is very easy to read and simple Yes/No questions are easy to understand.
B01DRV2BBY,EMC333,1,"I got this for my 95 year old mother, even set on high the ring tone is too low. We have tried all of the tones and none are loud enough for her to hear it all the time. My mom does where hearing aids and has no trouble hearing my cell phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Critter,5,"Purchased for a gift. I highly recommend this phone for seniors and people that just want a phone, not a space craft."
B01DRV2BBY,uncle allen,1,Company does not tell you if you have horizon towers are not too functional in your area then you will get poor quality and it will be too late to return the phone. Extremely poor customer service
B01DRV2BBY,MCM,1,It's never worked properly. I bought this for my dad and we hate it! The ring volume at it's highest is barely audible. I have great hearing and I can't hear it if the TV is on . He never hears it so then he doesn't answer and I think something has happened and he's unable to answer it . Shop for a better phone!
B01DRV2BBY,Daniel L.,3,"They should advertise their Bluetooth as Proprietary since it won't work with any non-Greatcall products. Support danced around the issue on 2 different calls for help, finally realized it was proprietary in Phone store where my old flip phone saw 12 bluetooth devices and Jitterbug saw none.
Plus: There is also no way to transfer contacts from old phone. After trying a multitude of methods including Best Buy, and Greatcall customer service, had re-type all contacts."
B01DRV2BBY,AMONI-STONE,1,"I thought it is an open phone that I can use other sim card on,but lo and behold I tried it and it didn't work,due to my schedule didn't have time to visit a phone shop to ascertain why it wouldn't work,and when I had time,after trying again, we got a notification to call a number,when we did that,they asking me to have an account with them,which I dont need,I bought a flip phone because that's what my mum is used to,and not getting another prepay service, on checking my order window found that the return date has elapsed,now am stuck with something we dont need and wont serve our purpose."
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,2,Good construction. Mediocre software. Terrible account management website.
B01DRV2BBY,Glover's Garage,4,"So far so good. My 96 year old mother needed a phone for when she goes to mailbox and not near a phone, in case she falls or needs help. We tried a smart phone and she was not able to hear on it or figure out how to use it. This was recommended by her Dr at Miracle ear. It seems to be working fine and she is able to hear with it okay. It is very simple."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,This phone's specs SAID that it is compatible with the Cricket network. IT IS NOT! AND it doesn't provide a SIM card.
B01DRV2BBY,Duchess Sanders,5,Great phone just didn't work with my carrier as I requested when searching for a flip cell phone. I had to return it regrettably especially since it was very good phone with all the features my husband needed.
B01DRV2BBY,jewelry galore,5,"This is a great phone for the elderly. My elderly parents have trouble with today's technology, so this phone was a perfect solution because it's VERY simple to use and helps keep in contact with my parents when they are away from home."
B01DRV2BBY,Kitty S.,2,"I like the idea of this phone but I am disappointed in the reality. I bought this phone for my 85 year old mother who had become frustrated using ""smart"" phones. There are 2 BIG problems with this phone. First, it uses the Verizon network through Great Call, which would not be a problem if her home was not in a Verizon dead zone. Once problem 1 was discovered it led to problem 2. This phone can ONLY be used on the Great Call network (using Verizon). There is NO option to unlock this phone to be used on another network (Isn't that illegal?) and Great Call offers no solutions to get around the very weak signal issue. Unfortunately Mom has missed many more calls than she has actually received. This becomes a real problem since her number is tied to the access gate where she lives. This phone has done more harm than good in providing cell connectivity for Mom and has added to the decline of her quality of life. Any future option I offer will like be met with great distrust and reluctance. So sad!"
B01DRV2BBY,Lauren,1,"Nice phone, easy to use--if it would only ring. Also, the yes/no buttons have to be stomped on to register. Such a disappointment. I thought we must have a rare lemon but I see in the reviews that plenty of other people have the same problem."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Phone is clumsy and heavy. Cannot delete old texts (phone does not permit that function). Great Call claims there is no contract...try cancelling. Time on phone exceeds 20 minutes and customer service is augmentative. Most unhelpful. Little over a week in use and absolutely hate this phone and there are not polite words for Great Call's âcustomer serviceâ.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"Great phone for my wife, very easy operation. Very happy with this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Thom,2,Phone keeps locking up. You have to remove battery in order to get phone to turn on. Great idea and service but not a quality product.
B01DRV2BBY,Patricia Matthews,1,"Bought on 10/21/2018, quit taking a charge on 1/10/2019. This is one of the worst phones on the market (5th one we have purchased for our 95 year old family friend & none have lasted more than a year) but itâs the only one on the market with numbers she can see. Looks like another manufacture would see the need for a simple good phone for senior citizens."
B01DRV2BBY,Love2Read,5,I purchased this product for my 92 year old father-in-law. The large numbers and easy to maneuver screen is perfect for someone who does not want to learn how to use a smart phone. He loved the red color too!
B01DRV2BBY,The BW,4,"More complicated that you would imaging, and no way to migrate contacts from the old phone, makes setup a pain in the butt, Add to that the high pressure attempts to increase the features of the program and it can be a senior SCAM very quickly. All that said, it functions well and the sound is clear."
B01DRV2BBY,C C.,1,Cheap product .... buttons stick .... continuously have to pop out the battery so it âresets â NOT a reliable product for the elderly..... I complained and got a replacement sent to me ..... same issues with the â newâ one ..... donât waste your money
B01DRV2BBY,Lynn Hirschfeld,5,It was exactly what we needed....
B01DRV2BBY,Doug,2,"Got this phone for my mom. Buttons and screen were big which is nice for her. Navigation between functions was somewhat challenging for her but I figured it out. Volume was crystal clear on both ends which was a big plus. However, the biggest disappointment was the phone would cut out and lose volume several times during conversations. This happened on every phone call she made. She tried to get it resolved through Greatcall with no success as the problem persists. She gave up and is returning the item."
B01DRV2BBY,Luuu,1,.35 per min you go over. $0.50 per text message. Phone is ok for simple calls but self deletes messages and very difficult for basic usage. A lot of hidden fees get added and bill could be over $70 each month. Go with Strait-Talk they are the best!
B01DRV2BBY,dbake,2,"Ringer - not loud. Speaker - not loud at all. Has their ""star"" button at the bottom that just confuses my dad who has dementia. Very disappointed with the overall phone. I will probably be looking for a different provider."
B01DRV2BBY,Krystiana Johnson,5,My Mom loves it and the emergency feature gives me a peace of mind
B01DRV2BBY,cbruner,5,Great for my 94 year old uncle! Reception is good where. He lives and couldn't get with other provider service.
B01DRV2BBY,Lorene sharples,3,"i would give it 5 stars. but it go,s dead on me often i have call jitterbug about 5 times they manage to help me but it keeps happing. i really feel i got a lemon all i wanted was a phone i could depend on its not this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,2,"WORKED FINE FOR A WEEK, THEN IT BROKE."
B01DRV2BBY,marge tisue,2,Poor sound quality for the hard of hearing. Very low ringer volume even on maximum and reception is poor. Would not buy again!
B01DRV2BBY,Karen Hodges,3,We intended to add it to an AT&T account but they said they could not activate a Jitterbug.
B01DRV2BBY,Jerry Carson,1,"This product was a piece of excrement. I babied it and kept it working (off & on) for two months at which point
it completely died. And then I found the return policy was for two months. And I was just past that date.

Which proves - don't buy a refurbished phone with a two month return - buy it from jitterbug - it is worth the extra $50.

Jerry Carson"
B01DRV2BBY,Shelli,3,"I thought this would be a good phone for my dad, but even I can barely hear on it, even with the volume on max. I wonder if I got a defective phone or if others have had this problem. Another smaller issue: The red 5 Star emergency button is too similar in location and appearance to the hang up button on iPhones, so my dad calls 5 Star frequently. User friendly phone, though."
B01DRV2BBY,mswans10,5,"Got this for my uncle, great for emergency plan. The number size is great for clear visual"
B01DRV2BBY,Missouri Shopper,5,An easy alternative for an aging population. Many older people just want a phone for emergencies - they don't or can't text or surf. This fits that need at a reasonable cost. Not confusing as a smartphone can be. Some people just need basics. My 92-year-old mother was happy with this gift.
B01DRV2BBY,James M.,3,"This unit was a bit buggy. It wouldn't always ring, sometimes it locked up and required a restart. It was replaced under the warranty within a few weeks. The company was very helpful and replaced it at their expense. It's easy to use and everything is large and easy to read. Customer service is very good."
B01DRV2BBY,viki,5,"This is a great phone for my husband who doesn't care for all the 'fancy' stuff. Second one he's had. Little 'fancier' than the first but still within his tolerance. Setting it up was a breeze through the Jitterbug website. He could keep his old # which was very convenient. He loves it, I love it. I'll stick with the 'fancy' stuff, thank you. Couldn't be an easier, better phone for most everyone. Takes pics, he can text, magnifies, and a few other slick features. And you can't beat the price! Very, very satisfied."
B01DRV2BBY,Pam,2,"Not as pleased as I should be for the price. The phone feels cheep, drops calls. It is very easy to operate. I'm still trying to get my husband to quit asking for his old phone back. Would not buy again."
B01DRV2BBY,JillysMama,1,It worked for 3 months and now the ringer doesn't work.
B01DRV2BBY,Bill,5,Great for use as a basic phone
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,5,Easy to use.. Yes or no on any task. Button are big and well lit
B01DRV2BBY,valerie,2,"Dependent on where you live, you may or may not have good coverage. I purchased 2 flip phones for my parents and while one of the phones read that it had good coverage strength, the other one could be standing in the exact same spot and would read fair or poor coverage. I needed these phones to work for my parents, however, my mother had to keep taking the battery out of hers in order for it to work. And that shouldn't need to happen every day."
B01DRV2BBY,MargaretKreps,2,Just after 1 month the phone started having problems. When you open thr flip it takes about 5 seconds before the screen lights up. Then you have to press each number a few times before it registers. This phone was for security. So much for that.
B01DRV2BBY,adriftinpa,3,Charging dock does not work. USB charging does work. Need a new dock. Short customer service hours. No online customer support. Mfg will not send a dock must return the entire package for a 25 cent part. Took the offered 15% discount.
B01DRV2BBY,Massachusetts,5,"My mom, who accidentally called 911 on a smart phone, swiping or tapping something that she didnt understand, absolutely loves this phone and is not afraid to use it! The buttons are large, the sound is great, the adjustments on the volume is A+ (some ring tones are louder than others) and the camera is even better than mine."
B01DRV2BBY,Mary R.,2,"Buttons don't work easily. It more often than not takes several attempts to switch between menus or lists. I got it for my husband thinking that it should be the easiest phone for him to work, but even I have had trouble working it."
B01DRV2BBY,seniorso42,4,This upgraded flip phone is so much easier to use and the speaker is great. I am very satisfied with this model.
B01DRV2BBY,Lisa,3,"I'm not very happy with this phone. I purchased it for my aging husband's because he enjoys a good flip phone. When he answers it, it sounds ad though he's in the bottom of a ton can and garbled."
B01DRV2BBY,Rosa L. Hughes,5,A very good phone for elderly.
B01DRV2BBY,SUSANCOOPER,4,If you want a phone just for calls it's fine. Texting seemed slow and the camera is fair
B01DRV2BBY,Laurel A. Swenson,5,It is hard to get thru to set it up but it beats a regular cell phone for someone who just needs it for an emergency. The big button is cool.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,They for get to tell you all the addition charges that you have to pay for to have the phone it self .
B01DRV2BBY,T. Sassano-Reid,5,"I can never say how much I love my Jitterbug. For me, a smart phone was a waste of time and money ! My Jitterbug is just what I need and the 5* button is icing on the cake I do recommend it to the older generation."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Did not get to use it as the monthly price was not as advertised nor did I know ahead of time there was an activation fee. Then I had to pay to ship it back. Very disappointed!!!!
B01DRV2BBY,Dedicated Shopper,5,Perfect for senior citizens.
B01DRV2BBY,C Evans,1,"Bought this as a gift for my aunt. The phone did not ring and after about 3 hours of calls to Great Call service, they decided the phone was defective and said they would send a replacement phone via 2-day mail. No new phone has arrived and the 30 day window for returns to Amazon is near, so I've returned the phone to Amazon. I'm incredibly disappointed because my aunt really wanted a simple phone with the option of an emergency contact button."
B01DRV2BBY,Albert G Rutherford,5,"Great for an ""unwired"" senior like me!"
B01DRV2BBY,Lassofcamelot,1,"Not happy w/Jitterbug! The phone was defective. I requested to return the phone & my experience w/this company, made the process very simple & easy. GreatCall gets a 5* for that process THOUGH!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amaury Cruz,4,Good option for elderly users. Simple and easy to read.
B01DRV2BBY,Willo,5,"Gave this phone to my Mother this past week. So simple to get set up and it is easy for her to use. I did get the package with the urgent care notifications, and I an able to see where her and the phone are anytime. Also able to see if it needs charging so I can remind her to do that.
Basically I hope all its great services never have to be used. But so good knowing they are there for her. I am in New York City she is in
Florida with not many people in her community she can count on. She still is able to live independently."
B01DRV2BBY,camillawk,5,So much better for seniors than a complicate iPhone
B01DRV2BBY,Don Markl,5,"Big buttons for use with old stiff fingers....is a great basic phone for making and receiving calls without all that other APP and unwanted fancy confusing hype that I never used.....I shut down my fancy phone and cut my bill in half plus got a phone that is easy to use.....if you don't want all the latest phone baloney, this is the phone for you."
B01DRV2BBY,Sean Preston,1,Would be great if unlocked.
B01DRV2BBY,Ronald E.,2,"Jitterbug uses the Verizon network which is unreliable from our location. We get good cell coverage from ATT, but this is not an option with Jitterbug.

The phone looks well suited for seniors, with easy to read keypad, menus and navigation.

I took off 3 stars because it took 45 minutes on the phone to request the service disconnection.They even suggested a $10 restocking fee unless we spoke to tech help. Then, they said the $10 fee applied only to phones purchased directly from Jitterbug.

The refund would be processed after the phone is received from Amazon."
B01DRV2BBY,Jeffrey S.,3,"Easy for my elderly mother to use, ringer could be louder. Reception isn't always the greatest."
B01DRV2BBY,BLT,5,"So far a wonderful phone for my husband. Phone has large numbers for seeing.. It's easy to use with just YES and NO to deal with. Self explanatory by just using, but the information booklet is well written. This is being the best phone my husband has had and happy we got it.."
B01DRV2BBY,Alfred Araujo,5,"It was easy, painless and fast to get it registered and fired-up to go.
I bought it from Amazon and initialized it online with GreatCall. I added the necessary contacts, changed the ringtone and charged the battery with no problems at all.

This is the first cell phone for my wife, who is 77, and she adapted well to it."
B01DRV2BBY,Engineer,5,Only phone my mother has been able to dial by herself.
B01DRV2BBY,digger6870,1,"Crappy phone, parents could not hear"
B01DRV2BBY,Mbc family,5,"78 & 97 year old grandmother's approve. This model uses the camera as a magnifier ""app"""
B01DRV2BBY,CMD-RN,5,Ordered to quickly replace a broken one. Fast delivery and works perfectly thus far. Will update if any probs. should arise. Highly recommend.
B01DRV2BBY,Joan Orso,5,"My 80 year old mother was so afraid of using it when we gave it to her for Christmas and she loves it! I love it because I can tell exactly where she is and have the comfort of knowing at anytime she needs medical assistance she can press the red ""help' button. A few times she got lost getting off at the wrong bus stop and know we can pinpoint her exact location. Best buy ever!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Easy to use with the large numbers and the yes button. The charging station does not work good so have to charge without it so is a little harder for my older mother to plug in.
B01DRV2BBY,CSH,5,My 96 year old mother loves this phone. The large buttons are great for eyesight and shaking fingers. The speaker option is loud (she likes that) but can be adjusted if needed. Perfect for seniors who need a simple cell phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Michael Parti,2,"This just concerns the hardware, not the phone service. Wall wart transformer doesn't work. This is used to charge the phone. I'm using the wall wart that came with my Kindle and that seems to work ok, although it seems to charge slowly. This is my mom's phone so I'll need to give her the transformer and to find another way to charge up my Kindle. I wish they'd done some better quality control on this."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Excellent for my hubby who doesn't like the smartphones!
B01DRV2BBY,rick nash,5,"I her purchased the phone for my mother and she is 81 years old and not very versed in electronics,however she has mastered the Jitterbug phone with very little coaching and she loves it,The large font and numbers are great for her."
B01DRV2BBY,Cindibee7,2,It worked great for 5 1/2 months. Then it just quit dialing. We can get calls just can't make them. Too bad because it's great for people who need bigger numbers.
B01DRV2BBY,blacklaserdog,1,"We purchased the phone, set it up with the 5 star emergency service. My mother in law fell down, broke 3 bones including 2 vertebrae. She pushed the 5 star button and got no help. She called my wife And had her call 911"
B01DRV2BBY,jim cole,5,I am 71 years old and I don't like cell phones because I can't read the numbers or even answer the darn thing. I needed a phone with large numbers and just plain simplicity. This was the ticket. Absolute perfection for me. Service with Great Call is great and available on line and easy to navigate. Wonderful phone!
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,"My 90yo Mom decided not to splurge on a cell. But Iâd recommend it for arthritic, hard of hearing and seniors needing simple instructions. It was beautiful and well made!"
B01DRV2BBY,J. Howell,1,"Very misleading advertisement. Supposedly works on the the Verizon network, yet three Verizon reps told me that this is not the case and that itâs not compatible with the networks they are and will be using."
B01DRV2BBY,Geranium,2,Too hard to press numbers and letters when texting. Very tiring on arm and finger muscles. Also was unable to make corrections in texts without having to delete everything after the correction.
B01DRV2BBY,Roseann,5,Purchased for husband who is not too tech savy. It is a great phone with great reception and the battery has a very long life compared to other types of phones.
B01DRV2BBY,steven t.,4,works great and no hidden fees
B01DRV2BBY,poondaco,3,This does not work on verizon system. I probably missed that in the fine print. It is a contract carrier. Looks like a great phone but not able to connect to my carrier.
B01DRV2BBY,Deja Blu,1,"OH - yeah, they have the fine print at the BOTTOM of the box. It's $35.00 to activate the darn phone! NO WHERE ELSE is this listed! Slimy way to get more money after paying $60.00 for the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,5,"The phone is a good basic phone for those that are overwhelmed by smartphones. However, the customer service is the best around, even for those that don't have problems with technology. They explain everything, which maybe overkill to younger people, but for the target users this is exactly what they are looking for; someone they can trust is doing the right thing for them."
B01DRV2BBY,Michael P,1,"The phone is cheap, but the GreatCall customer service and processes are the worst. They have three different passwords for different interactions with the company. I've been locked out for months because I was missing one of their passwords, so they' shut down my account. They wouldn't take my credit card payment to keep the phone service! After three separate calls to their service center, I finally found someone who let me use my secret questions to verify myself. They really need to train their people and assess their processes.

I strongly suggest you stay away from this company and use a simple phone for seniors from a major carrier like Verizon, AT&T, ..."
B01DRV2BBY,Paul S.,1,"Received his flip phone on June 8th and from the start it was very slow to display the key pad r you flipped it open. There was al least a 5 second lapse, and now it is August the 24th and it has quit working. Not display, nothing, just dead. Very disappointed in this phone and it functionality."
B01DRV2BBY,R. L. Thompson,5,Easy activation and transfer of existing landline number. When I called Greatcall customer service they answered right away without getting stuck in an automated phone system. Overall great experience on website.
B01DRV2BBY,LEROY R.PLUMLEY,5,This Phone preforms all functions in a Great Way!!
B01DRV2BBY,Beverly,5,"I purchased this product for my 89 year old mother, who is in the nursing home. It's the perfect phone for her because of it's simplicity and ease of operation."
B01DRV2BBY,crystal,5,I like the emergency button that I can press and someone can get in touch with me and get me help immediately. big buttons instead of tiny ones which make calling hard.
B01DRV2BBY,Edward M Kirkpatrick,5,"This is a great cellphone. I had bought one earlier for my brother. Thought he needed a replacement but he didn't so I did return this item. However, If I needed to buy an easy to use flip phone again I definitely would buy this one!"
B01DRV2BBY,Apryl,5,Totally worth it!! The phone is awesome. Jitterbug has so much to offer anyone with a need or handicap in your life. My mom is legally blind and can see these buttons. They also have a operater that can make the call for them for assistance. Offer emergency assistance. And can keep a medical record for you. In case of a emergency. And will notify first responders. I'm so glad I got this for my mom.
B01DRV2BBY,John,3,Nice phone but poor audio.
B01DRV2BBY,IAM,5,"This phone was intended for using with 5 star service. So far it seems to be working very well and has been tested by checking in with 5 star a couple of times, they were very prompt. I would recommend this as opposed to the smaller button types for 5 star service."
B01DRV2BBY,Adam Oaks,5,"Bought it for my mother that is 87, and she loves it."
B01DRV2BBY,Sissy,5,So easy to use. I purchased a different flip phone but it was too complicated for this senior to use so I returned to Jitterbug since it is very easy to use.
B01DRV2BBY,Ohio,5,Needed a cell phone for my Dad to use - the larger keys are easier for him to use and the voice dial system is awesome
B01DRV2BBY,SwampThing,5,"I had several smart phones, but I don't like doing email, etc on a phone, all I wanted was a phone in case of emergency, & I love this Jitterbug, I have had no problems, it works for me, & the rate per month sure beats the other phones I had."
B01DRV2BBY,Linda,3,"For a cell phone that is supposed to be fantastic for seniors to use easily, this phone has presented more than its share of challenges in the initial stages of set up as well as ease of using the voice dial."
B01DRV2BBY,William Miller,5,"Everything about this phone is perfect for the elder person. All the promos are accurate. GreatCall made it easy to activate. It bounces off the Verizon towers, so make sure you have one near you."
B01DRV2BBY,Kelly,5,great item
B01DRV2BBY,Adam,1,does not work with t-mobile as indicated
B01DRV2BBY,Bill,5,I bought this for my 88 year old mother. It is the easiest cell phone out there for senior citizens. The only improvement I would recommend is to make the speaker volume louder.
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,4,"Got this phone for my husband, and he loves it. Simple to operate and big numbers for dialing...."
B01DRV2BBY,Nellis K. Klein,1,Trying for two days to activate this phone. Great Call says it will be 24 hours before they can turn it on. If that does not work I am returning this phone to Amazon for credit.
B01DRV2BBY,ruthieo54,2,This phone is not easy to use and doesnât even have a backspace delete button for misspellings while thexting. You have to answer questions needing yes or no answers to every feature on the phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"I purchased this phone for my mother because I saw it advertised a lot for seniors. I like the flip phone for her and the large numbers. However, soon after I purchased it there was issues with the battery right away. It never kept a charge very long and it would turn off and not turn on quickly. I don't know if I got a bad phone or if it was reconditioned but it was not a good buy for us."
B01DRV2BBY,Ali Rae Jae,4,"My 78 yo father's first cell phone and it's going well enough. He couldn't use a ""regular"" cell phone. This one works ok so far."
B01DRV2BBY,zazzu,4,Bought this for my elderly husband. He was having trouble using a smart phone. This is the second one he's had and comes with a new stand-up style charger that he really likes.
B01DRV2BBY,Jamie C,2,"Poor, unreliable reception. This is the 2nd (replacement) phone that I ordered. The problem is most likely with the cell service and not the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,GSP,3,"i bought for my aunt and eventhough its easy to use, the lifespan is short and poor reception..on my second phone after 6 months. lets see how this holds up."
B01DRV2BBY,booper70,3,"I bought this phone for my mother in another state she called when she received and told me she needed to activate on
a PC (she does not have one) I tried to activate it on line it was such a hassel (so much info) I then called the care call
number it was the same thing but mostly I needed so much of my mother's information to keep her previous phone number
this is not an easy activation I had to write instructions for her to use the new phone and the number would be different EEEK!!!
and there was a $35 activation fee????"
B01DRV2BBY,Michael R. Greenberg,5,This phone was what my dad needed it's simple and easy to use
B01DRV2BBY,donald koenig,5,"Purchased this for my 80 year old, non-techy Dad and he loves it. Can easily hear the ringer, people on the other end and easy to use."
B01DRV2BBY,Pat S,5,My mother who is 86 loves this phone . Very easy to operate.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,"Overrated bought for my father-in-law who does not hear well volume inadequate, ringer inadequate. Using it for retrieving a missed call, etc non-existent"
B01DRV2BBY,James Sansom,5,"Great phone, bought it for my wife who is technically challenged ( does not like anything more complex than a light switch ) was easy to set up and she has no problems using when she needs to."
B01DRV2BBY,charley'slove,4,"Bought this for emergency purposes only--because I hated the complications of using the iPhone I had previously. But for a simple device, it's got some unfortunate fatal flaws.
1) You can't adjust volume up or down while on a phone call, which is exactly when you need to be able to do it. If you try, your conversation echoes and you can't talk. You have to hang up, adjust the volume offline, then recall. PLEASE!
2) ""GreatCall,"" the only service provider for the Jitterbug, ballyhoos its live help desk, but to get to it you have to remember to dial ""611."" I suggest a direct ""How-to"" button at the bottom next to the 5-star button (which is its quasi-emergency service line with live people who can connect you to the help you need all the way up to an 9-1-1 call.)
3) There is a less than adequate low battery notification. Yes, it'll give you a ""low"" or ""critical"" message if you happen to be using the phone at the time, but if you're an infrequent caller like me, that doesn't help. The volume of the low battery beep unfortunately sounds at the same volume as you have set your call volume, so if it's too low, you WILL NOT HEAR the audio low battery signal. It is a constant annoyance to me to find the battery drained when I don't know it's happening
4) There's no reason these minor fixes can't be cheaply corrected while at the same time manufacturing another version of this phone 1"" less tall to make it a much more popular size that younger people, kids, and even techies could embrace when they don't need or want Internet connectivity. Marketing it strictly to ""old people"" is a big mistake."
B01DRV2BBY,tedi rockwell,1,"stopped working phone is very disappointing
thought it would be easy for seniors"
B01DRV2BBY,Anita Barnes Wright,5,"The phone was for my dad, who is in his 80!s, and he has found the phone use a bit challenging. But overall, I feel it was a great purchase. As a daughter, I enjoy helping him use the user-friendly buttons, the yes/no responses, and the scrolling arrow keys. He is getting the hang of it and is eager to learn and gain access to all the features such as texting and taking pictures! Weâll attemp those next year! Really great phone for elders new to technology."
B01DRV2BBY,Pyewacket,5,Love it! Completely uncomplicated.
B01DRV2BBY,Sylvia Ricciardi,5,If you purchase this item directly it has a one year warranty but if purchased at Amazon it only has a five day warranty so you need to purchase the handset replacement plan.
B01DRV2BBY,Jessi Hatfield,5,"My mother and I have been trying different phones for my 80 year old grandma for over a year and NONE of them were as easy to comprehend as this one. My grandma absolutely loves it and she is able to do things she never could before like text and take photos. This was the answer to all our troubles, I only wish we could have tried this one sooner!"
B01DRV2BBY,janieg,4,"Like the phone, easy to use but customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
B01DRV2BBY,Paul J.,5,Mother inlaw loves it
B01DRV2BBY,Dave W.,5,Great for the visually impaired.
B01DRV2BBY,Susan Barber,4,"It is easier for my Mom to use. Set up was a bit confusing. I wanted to set up the phone myself on-line so Mom would get the $25,00 gift. I ultimately had to talk to support, but they did send the gift to my Mom and I am glad about that."
B01DRV2BBY,Robert J.,5,"Had Tracfone but wife got to point she could not handle al that swiping and what not. Got her one of these and I actually gets call from her, and she answers here phone when out shopping. She lives it."
B01DRV2BBY,Howard Juneau,3,"Only bought it for the 5-star button. Convenient, not as easy to use as other flip phones of used in the past by Nokia, Samsung etc. Bought for parents, I can't figure out the contact list for crying out loud."
B01DRV2BBY,A. Joseph Ventura,4,Easy to use is correct i'm pleased to have purchased this phone
B01DRV2BBY,Mike M.,5,thanks
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"My wife has dementia and struggling to become proficient using all of the available options. However, she is able to use the most important items, such as sending and receiving calls. I'm very pleased with the 5 button. All in all, bravo."
B01DRV2BBY,izzyB,2,It wasn't that easy to set up. It took nearly a month to get it up and running.
B01DRV2BBY,Wendy Epperly,5,My aunt is technology resistant. She had a mobile phone before and wouldn't use it. It was too complicated. She loves receiving pictures of her grandbaby on her Jitterbug. She has even learned how to forward the pictures to me. It is also a great option for long distance calls instead of using her landline.
B01DRV2BBY,KC,5,My parents love these phones. Due to their age we are using great call to tract them. Very nice feature to have. They feel safe and we feel safe too knowing where they are just in case.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,3,"I purchased this phone because I have extremely low vision. It works, but does appear to have some quirks.. the volume tends to reset itself. It turns off sometimes unexpectedly. Have to be precise putting in charger stand, but can be connected to computer directly. I came from Verizon to GreatCall and kept my same hpone number. I understand that GreatCall uses Verizon's network., but it is nowhere near as reliable as Verizon. Sometimes I must enter area code, other times no for the same number. Sometimes it just will not connect a number period.
I have not used any of the features other than just straight phone calling.
On the positive side, the number buttons are large and clear and stay lit long enough to find and push. The screen is large enough and the numbers appearing on screen are clear enough. The speaker works well. It is the only flip phone I found for people with low vision and is much easier to use for me than a regular flip phone. Large enough to find quickly in purse."
B01DRV2BBY,Here we go again,1,"The real cost if you want all the features of this phone is 25 dollars per month, not 15 dollars per month.
Which is fine, but the contacts didn't work meaning I couldn't add anybody to my phone-book. Customer support wasn't helpful.
Please, don't buy this phone"
B01DRV2BBY,Jeannine,5,"Great, simple phone! Very easy to use. My husband loves it!"
B01DRV2BBY,Imad S.,5,"I had to return before using as my mother has t mobile carrier already and I did not know that this phone has to activate and use sellers plan, I like the phone for quality and design for seniors"
B01DRV2BBY,Linda C,2,"While a good product, it did not meet the needs of my mother, who has both visual and hearing issues. I tried to make it work for her, utilizing some of the features that have to be set up by calling for assistance - which takes forever! When I went to return it, I found that the return date was based on the shipping date, not when it was delivered - so I'm stuck with a product that I can't use. I'm disappointed, but I do think the product appears of good quality and features."
B01DRV2BBY,Linda Aaskov,4,"Only complaint is that it is heavy , in my purse or pocket I'm very much aware that it is there."
B01DRV2BBY,thedish,5,Worked great for my dad. Easy to program and use.
B01DRV2BBY,Mark E.,5,"I bought this for my elderly mother and she's had no problems using it, seeing the screen (she has horrible vision), hearing calls and she feels more secure with the 5-Star Service GreatCall offers. They check on her daily and she has what amounts to a ""panic button"" on the phone. And since it's bright red, it's easy for her to find if she needs to get to it fast.

This phone is simple, but tailored for the elderly and, while it doesn't have the bells and whistles of my iPhone, is absolutely perfect for my mother and her needs. Keep in mind this is only the phone, you have to buy monthly service from GreatCall, the only network the phone works on. My interactions with them have all been first class, great service and a very clear understanding of how their customers use the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,"I thought I would like it , it had the old jitterbug that worked fine, now this one has a poor signal, even after charging it 24 hrs, still poor signal i took it out side and gav e me a good signal only for a few seconds, then back to pooor, could not get it to change, called tech, they said
i still could use it, but words cut out, I sent it back, will look for another brand now,"
B01DRV2BBY,Mslacy,5,nice phone my uncle loves it
B01DRV2BBY,anders,5,This is the first cell phone that my mother has dedicated enough energy toward the learning of functions so as to be able to use the phone. And she's pretty happy with it.
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle3 Customer,4,"I have enjoyed this phone, have been very happy with it.However, it quit working yesterday. It is fully charged but there is the screen is black and I can't get any keys to work. I could use some help."
B01DRV2BBY,Gretchen DeWitt,5,"It is very easy to use. The sound is clear. One problem is that the phone number supplied, should you choose one, is not an old one but recently use."
B01DRV2BBY,jacqueline,5,"so far so good. this was bought for my legally blind brother since birth.
his verizon smart phone was too much phone for him.
we did not do the verizon service ( yes you can). so far so happy.
and the four orfive times ihad customer service contact i had nothing but sweet wonderful reps."
B01DRV2BBY,td,5,I bought this for my father who was struggling with a smartphone. He can make and receive calls like a pro. I recommend this phone ð±. ðð¼
B01DRV2BBY,"Kelly - Charlotte, NC",5,Purchased for my father. He likes it.
B01DRV2BBY,CE Brown,4,The phone is nice the customer service needs to get their story together.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,My dad really likes this phone. He has macular degeneration and it helps him to see the numbers and calls easier. Service is good as well (5-Star)
B01DRV2BBY,Leigh M Freedman,1,This phone would not get reception at the house where the owner lived. Every other phone works fine. We tried several different days with no success and customer service could not help.
B01DRV2BBY,RoboReader,1,"Unreliable. Bought for my elderly mother, but I can't depend on it to work. At least once a week I have to remove the battery to reboot it. Jitterbug tells me it's a known problem. Tell that to my mother when she is without a phone and alone."
B01DRV2BBY,Susan Robertson-Starr,5,"I purchased this for my husband who has never been good with gadgets or electronics. It's easy to use, very intuitive, and has greater functionality than I had anticipated. The call list would be awkward for someone with many contacts. But for the 8 or 10 that my husband uses, it's not a problem."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Using the phone is simple. Nice to know that if a dialing error is made to 5star there is followup to confirm. The hard part was the initial setting up of the phone account online for someone else.
B01DRV2BBY,ð,5,"Brought this phone for my mom, who's an elderly lady, find its much easier for her to use."
B01DRV2BBY,Richard K. Ohsowski,5,I Love It So Easy To Use So I Purchesed 1 For My Wife It Needs 2 Improvements 1- A Louder Ring 2- Be Able To Save Both Landline And Cell Numbers Both On Same Listing
B01DRV2BBY,Mr. Boyd,5,Made the perfect gift. The old man was extremely reluctant but now heâs all into it.
B01DRV2BBY,Diana Smith,5,My Husband & I Love this phone...it is easy to use and not at all hard to navigate ..plus the letters are large enough to read..thank you.
B01DRV2BBY,Diana M. Dobias,5,"This phone is just what I wanted. Has the basics, since I only plan on using it in case of an emergency. Since I am hard of hearing, I was pleasantly surprised when I found that I could actually hear fine on it."
B01DRV2BBY,Jim Williams,1,Signed up for HBO trial - went to cancel.....THERE IS NO CANCEL - you pay for cancellation information!! I WILL NEVER WATCH HBO again - and I will pass the word to everyone - avoid HBO - they're low class and won't allow cancellation
B01DRV2BBY,Chloe Giampaolo,5,The price of the phone and the monthly charge beats anything else I've looked into!
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,3,"I like the color, the feel in my pocket -closed lid so I don't accidentally dial 911 when I'm walking or mowing, but half the time it doesn't work! Right now I'm being serviced by Great Call to ""update the software"" because it has NEVER allowed me to TEXT a message. I write the text and the only choice I get is to ""Call?"" the person. Even the service rep's phone on the other end of the line did the same thing. Great Call uses Verizon towers and I HATE Verizon! Also, some of the time, my phone doesn't even come on even when it was charged in the little ""stand."" If they can work out their problems, it's a nice shape, size and simple enough to carry on walks or working in the yard."
B01DRV2BBY,Jim,1,"Two days after return expired, this phone completely died. Can not turn on even holding the power button for 1 min. I am now without phone service or protection, Definetely would not recommend this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Julie Alonso,4,"My 83 year old father is finally happy! Only issue is (and all phones have it) the volume buttons are on the side, so when they hold it - it turns the ringer down. ThÃ¨n they cant hear the phone ring.

Colors great and the phone cradle is great. No fuss with the little plug in.

Emergency services is a good security feeling."
B01DRV2BBY,Lorraine Borgi,1,Returned. Had to sign up for Great Call Service. Too expensive.
B01DRV2BBY,deb sanok,2,Very nice phone easy to use. The plans however are pricey. And tried to get voice dialing set up and never did. Had the phone 2 weeks. Switched to another phone and carrier. Got a bill not even 2 weeks after activating it.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,Not as user friendly and ringer not that loud for senior citizens
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,Not dependable. Works only when it wants to.

B01DRV2BBY,Finiska,5,I bought this as a replacement for my grandmother's phone. The company was great to deal with. One of the easiest phone setups I've done!
B01DRV2BBY,just me,1,"Cannot add to existting att

B01DRV2BBY,austin571,2,"Did not turn on, but return was easy."
B01DRV2BBY,Denice Rodriguez,2,quality of these phones seem refurbished then on top of everything the good customer svc from great call is horrible
B01DRV2BBY,Cheryl J.,1,My husband has had nothing but trouble with this phone. It jingles constantly and the jingle is turned off. Today when the phone was ringing he flipped it open and it kept ringing. Very disappoiinting and now the 30 days for return is past!!
B01DRV2BBY,Jay N Fues,5,I bought this phone for my wife who has vision problems. It meets her expectations and she learns the various features easily.
B01DRV2BBY,Eddi Haskell,5,"Easy to use product, my mom loves it, Great Call bills are very low, 50% the cost of Verizon service."

B01DRV2BBY,sandi,5,Would recommend this phone Bought it for my Dad that has never used a cell phone very easy for him to use and read w/o his glasses...
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Got this for my dad. It is so much easier to use than his old Trac Phone. I really the screen prompts that ask the user what they want to do. It's very user friendly.
B01DRV2BBY,Melissa Smith,5,MOM IS HAVING ISSUES WITH POWERING ON THIS WAS REPLACED ONCE.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,The emergency call feature requires an added monthly charge; I have not used because of this!
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"Bought this for my father, but regret it. Unreliable coverage, awful sound quality, ringer would frequently not work....all-around disappointed in this product."
B01DRV2BBY,Ruth K. Newman,1,"This phone caused problems from the beginning .... had to have a new battery sent to solve one problem, and then another popped up... no ring tone before you spoke the name of the person you wanted to dial... the final blow was when it would not stop the call coming ring ... until I finally took the battery out to quiet it
The company has since sent me a refurbished one, and hopefully it will work properly!"
B01DRV2BBY,Christy Threlkeld,5,My mother in law loves it!!! Itâs is exactly what sheâs been wanting. Had I only listened 6 years ago!! ððð
B01DRV2BBY,B-Rad,3,"Bluetooth is crap, no vibrate and annoying dial tone when you open up the phone. But a lot cheaper for my dad. $15 a month vs $31 with Verizon."
B01DRV2BBY,John G. Walterick,5,Bought for my wife. easy to see and use. Great Call easy to deal with.
B01DRV2BBY,Victoria Holliday,1,"I thought it was a phone that was simple inexpensive and had good customer support. The buttons were big enough but I decided not to even have it ""hooked up"" because the fees associated with turning on the phone was more than my current cell phone plan...the monthly bill would have been more as well."
B01DRV2BBY,Damion B.,5,Very very suprised on the call quality!
B01DRV2BBY,J. Cook,3,"Nice phone, taxes and miscellaneous charges on phone plan are high."
B01DRV2BBY,Robert N Reese,4,"The phone looks great works great has great features, but the keys sticjk all of the time"
B01DRV2BBY,Dno,4,"Bought this for a Relative with Disability. He loves the Phone and it is easy to Use. One improvement would be if it was easier to open.. If it has push button flip.. then it would be close to ideal.

The Charging Cradle is great for people who would have trouble to plug in a cable.. ( People with only one working hand )

This is a good idea and good for people with disabilities."
B01DRV2BBY,Ron Howell,5,Bought this for my Mom in the nursing home. She loves it! Numbers are easy to use and she can hear it very well. She has early dementia and this flip phone is like what she used to have. That made it nice.
B01DRV2BBY,Maureen Stevens,5,Love this phone. Everything it advertised and more. Perfect for seniors~~~
B01DRV2BBY,Joan in Shadowland,1,"Bought this in MARCH of this year, and it stopped working! Won't take a charge at all with any charging dock or plug. Would give it a zero if I could."
B01DRV2BBY,Debbie Bannon,5,Wonderful phone for an elderly parent. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Easy to move things over from another carrier. Was less money for us. Provides a star button for emergencies. And best of all their Customer Service is top notch. They are the most friendly and easiest to deal with than any other company.
B01DRV2BBY,V. Smith,5,Worked great for my dad who had difficulty opening other flip phones
B01DRV2BBY,John H. Ritchie,1,"Don't waster your money, phones do not support the current Cell framework. They are technologically old and consequently do not work very well. I also do NOT recommend GreatCall under any circumstance. As soon as I opened an account, they sent me a late bill. I had just put $30 dollars on the account and only used 5 minutes of call time. I cancelled within two weeks and they still send me a bill for that month - stupid people and a bad company."
B01DRV2BBY,Hdance,3,"Had phone since January 2018 and the volume keeps going down to almost nothing. Have to completely restart the phone in order to get the proper volume. Nothing I can do about it now, guess I have to live with it."
B01DRV2BBY,Roy,4,"Doesnât have a battery level monitor. Cannot download ringtones from internet sources, just a few provided by service provider."
B01DRV2BBY,Donna Lehneis,5,I bought this phone for my 79 year old mother. She loves it and I love the peace of mind I get knowing she has help just a button push away.
B01DRV2BBY,mike,4,great for seniors and works well but tell them to red the directions!
B01DRV2BBY,Peggy,5,"works great, color and light is good for old eyes, The photos are very good. My husband can hear really well. All around wonderful product."
B01DRV2BBY,tanja biebel,3,Great phone. Great call needs to figure out how to put a black number feature on phone. Especially for scam calls coming into Seniors. Which is the target market for the phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Tom,1,"Enjoy the hidden fees. There's a $35 activation fee, you have to pay an extra $3 a month for voicemail (who doesn't want voicemail?) etc. These fees aren't readily disclosed. $10 of the activation fee is waived if you sign up online instead of over the phone

I never enjoy starting off on a bad foot. However its about what you have to expect from most cell providers, who do their best to obfuscate, add fees and charge extra whenever possible.

Its also the first Verizon network device I've tried. I'm unimpressed with the vaunted Verizon coverage, or this phone lacks the band support for some of Verizons build out. I get good, average to low average signal for T-Mobile and Sprint at my house and at my dads house. The Verizon signal on the Jitterbug at my house was so low I had to go up to the 3rd floor and walk around until I got enough to activate the phone, then the signal level was 'poor' at my dads house.

Updated review:

Dropped to one star. After 10 months of use the device goes ""dead"" and the only way to get it to work again is to pull the battery and put it back in. When I called greatcall, they said its a known problem, had no explanation how a phone works for ten months and then doesn't and insisting it was not defective. I was initially refused a replacement or refund, with an attempt to upsell me to the android smartphone. Once I got a supervisor, they offered to replace the phone and said ""no chance"" at a refund. It seems they've never heard of small claims court.

Oh and its not the weak verizon network, its the device. Another verizon device at the same addresses gets perfectly good signal.

Steer clear of this giant piece of %@#^ and get a decent big button flip phone. Horrible product, horrible service, just no."
B01DRV2BBY,Janet C. Johnson,5,"Haven't had it long enough to determine battery life and durability, but so far am very pleased."
B01DRV2BBY,vtandy,5,Great phone for someone that is technically challenged.
B01DRV2BBY,Grandma R,5,great for husband
B01DRV2BBY,FLFF,2,"This phone was NOTHING like I wanted nor was advertized! The volume buttons are on the right side just where your fingers hit when holding it! Design fail! If you already have a phone and account, they DO NOT tell you that IF you want to keep your same number it will take around three days to transfer (port over) your old number!! Again design FAIL! NONE of this is ever told you IN ADVANCE!! Ease of use for seniors HARDLY due to not asking if I had a prepaid account numbers and so on! I will make an addendem to this review as things change or get better!

Addendum to above: I finally got my old cell phone number ""ported"" over and it NOW shows on my screen, I will try to adapt and make do with this phone because it is STILL easier (in spite of my password hell) than the others. And having returned a few bad cell phones after purchase, I know where that leads."
B01DRV2BBY,Terry L. Fischer,2,"couldn't work it, and it kept needing to be replaced"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"Purchased for my mother, 1st time cell user. Very basic. All options are ""yes"" or ""no""
Perfect for her."
B01DRV2BBY,Howard Wong,5,great for the elderly. Nice big buttons. easy to use
B01DRV2BBY,Reg,5,My 95 yr old Mother Loves it. Old School Works. Other manufacturers should take notice to thos old style â.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,It was a replacement for a patient of mine.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,3,Serves my husband's needs. Only deficiency that we've noticed is that contacts are listed in order of entry rather than alphabetical.
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,4,My mother can use this phone easily for the most part. It has big numbers and letters which are very helpful.
B01DRV2BBY,Chris,1,My motherâs phone is already having major problems after just over a year. She wants to go back to a land line.
B01DRV2BBY,Virginia,3,bought two phones for my wife and me to replace traxphones that failed us to many times. these are better but still sometimes will miss calls.
B01DRV2BBY,Zaphod Beeblebrox,5,"I purchased this for my grandmother. She is not very technical, so a smartphone would not be a good match for her.

Greatcall is the carrier, you will spend about 15 minutes on the website setting everything up [remember, this is for someone who is NOT technical, but it allows you to setup everything, including the phone book (call list) that is sent down to the phone]. If your transferring another phone number, the process is simple. Greatcall gives you a temp phone number to get the phone activated that minute. Then you have to call Greatcall on their 800 number and give them the information from the current carrier. We had to call T-mobile to get the PIN code setup for transfer, but that's really simple. We were able to transfer my grandmother's phone number from T-Mobile in a few hours. The people on the line at Greatcall were really nice and helpful.

One issue, which was resolved quickly by Greatcall on the phone, is after you setup the phone, we did not want text. If you do not select any plans that include text, Greatcall turns it on at $0.10 per message. We called, and they removed it so my grandmother cannot receive texts. She hates text messaging [her choice, I just wanted her to be happy]. Greatcall had no issue removing the text has very happy to do it.

The other thing about Greatcall, they let you add someone else to control the account. This way, my grandmother can tell me what she wants done, I can call Greatcall on her behalf, and take care of the issue for her. That is a very nice feature. Also, I had to call them twice, once for blocking text and getting information on transferring her phone number to calling back in to give them all the information on transferring the phone number. Both times, difference agents, they were very friendly and professional and did not sound like they were in another country.

Now more about the phone. She loves it. When you open it, you hear the dial tone just like the old landline POTS phones [how 1950s can you get]. I think my Grandmother said it best that this is a phone for old folks. It has a magnifier built in, and the characters and fonts are all very large. Very easy to see. The menus to move through the phone book are simple and easy to use. I can see if she was to use text, it would have been easy to use as well [but Grandmother gets what Grandmother wants].

Also, Grandma loves the red color. It's easy to see and find.

The only setback, and this is really the industries fault, I guess the spam callers figure out if your on Greatcall, your an senior. The spam calls have increased trying to sell Grandma all sorts of garbage. I do wish Greatcall would block more of these spam calls.

Overall, it's a great phone, light weight, easy to read and easy to use. Grandma is happy, and that makes me happy."
B01DRV2BBY,kenneth payne,5,W like it because our blind disabled relative can use it Your features you advertised sold us on it. thank you
B01DRV2BBY,ALICAT123,5,We bought this phone for my father. He loves it and has no trouble using it. The phone was cheaper to get via Amazon than GreatCall direct. All rest assured because of the emergency call feature.
B01DRV2BBY,Lee W.,4,I liked the phone but due to dementia my wife could not use it.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"This deserves less than one star. The phone died less than 6 months after purchasing. Great Call is not that great of service as well. I would not recommend this phone, or service."
B01DRV2BBY,Taz,5,Mother in law loves it and it's super user friendly and easy
B01DRV2BBY,Cheryl,1,My father is 80. Bought the phone for him. Right from the start the phone screen would go blank. Stay of for 4 hours at times or 10 to 20 min. Returned phone and received 2nd phone. When I called to have it activated I was told of a software glitch. If screen goes blank hold on/off button for a few seconds and it should come back on. Well this phone is worse than the 1st phone. Never know when it would come on. What good is it if he needs the 5* and the phone is none workable. Now I am told I cannot return this one because the return time was Feb 1st. Good lord I just got this phone in December. OUT $53.
B01DRV2BBY,Michael Carter,5,Getting started document could use some more info. User guide printed to small. Phone works great.
B01DRV2BBY,BIG DOG,5,Perfect cell phone for seniors.
B01DRV2BBY,Sharon H.,5,I purchased this phone for my parents who are in their 80's. The numbers are easy to read.
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,1,I ordered the phone for my 80 year old stepdad as a gift==I just gve it to him last weekend 10/7 and it did not work---it would not charge after we had called to activate it===we were all VERY upset and will have to send it back===should have bought direct from jitterbug & not amazon..no paperwork so struggling to send it back now
B01DRV2BBY,j smith,5,"I bought this phone for my Dad, because the smart phone was too much for him. This is an easy to use phone, simple and straight forward. The Great Call customer service does an awesome job, very supportive and accommodating . You can program all phone numbers from your computer."
B01DRV2BBY,Tina b. sangos,5,"Replaced my father's original phone which he had used for years and was concerned features would be different but not so. First time he purchased anything online. He is happy with the phone, whew! Easy to transfer contacts via phone with service provider."
B01DRV2BBY,Marney Stoumbelis,4,Bought for my father who is 98 and he was enthusiastic but still it is too many steps from screen to screen. I might like it if he gives it up!
B01DRV2BBY,K. Gibbs,5,I bought this for my elderly Mom and she loves it! Easy for her to use and dependable.
B01DRV2BBY,ALICIA,5,Purchased for my father. Great phone and features.
B01DRV2BBY,Thomas Ellison,5,Good Purchase
B01DRV2BBY,Herman,5,Product is exactly as described and represents a good value.
B01DRV2BBY,RA,5,Just what I ordered for an older person.
B01DRV2BBY,Larry,1,Bad sound quality coming in and going out. Not very user friendly. Caller I.D. display too small for visually impaired. I do not recommend this phone.
B01DRV2BBY,LLC,5,The first cell phone my mom would actually use. Now she's calling old girlfriends and family members and texting pictures back and forth with her grandchildren. Super simple to use. She occasionally hits the red alert button accidentally but the call center calls back to verify she's ok.
B01DRV2BBY,TM,5,Phone is perfect for 96 year old. Just what we needed.
B01DRV2BBY,DBWyatt,5,"It was what we needed at the time. However, I threw away the box too soon. My Mom is no longer able to use phone and I can't return it without original box."
B01DRV2BBY,Jane Boolds,1,I had the old jitterbug and it was excellent. This one is terrible the buttons stick and the reception is awful when the weather is bad. I will probably buy a different phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Awesome for the elderly. Purchased it for my elderly mother inlaw.
B01DRV2BBY,Anthony A,1,I purchased the phone after reviewing several forums that show this to be Verizon Compatible. I don't want the device any longer and want to be able to return it
B01DRV2BBY,Billye Newcomb,4,Did not like. Sent back
B01DRV2BBY,william j williams jr,2,we found the keys hard to depress and the jitterbug could not detect my key when it requested a yes or no request?
B01DRV2BBY,KEKAJOJO,5,Was given for a gift and she loved it!!!!
B01DRV2BBY,Mike B,5,seamless transfer from my old carrier to my flip phone. would reccomend
B01DRV2BBY,F,5,for me this is perfect in every way very very happy!
B01DRV2BBY,SK,5,My 92 year old mom has no problem using this phone. It works well and we are both very happy.
B01DRV2BBY,BJ Christian,1,This flip phone jitterbg doesnt't work. I've bought extra chargers and it still doesn't work. Being legally blind I doon't drive so I can't return it. I have a landline and when that goes out I am without communication. I'm very disappointed. BJ Christian
B01DRV2BBY,G. Sandra J. Huhn,5,"Only one problem - I was given a phone number that had been previously used. After 6 months, I am still receiving calls for the previous owner. Otherwise it's just what I wanted in a Cell Phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Anne Clark,1,"Many many problems with this phone including poor sound quality and the ringer working only some of the time (when turned on). I received no help from GreatCall customer service when I told them why I was cancelling coverage. I was told tehry were ""sorry"" but not transferred to any tech
support etc. I am deeply disappointed in this phone and GreatCalls. It has been like sitting around burning $20 bills."
B01DRV2BBY,Norma Jean,5,Phone is great. Nice to have phone service in addition to what Splash provides.
B01DRV2BBY,Jesus Freak!,5,I love this phone! It is everything as described in the description!
B01DRV2BBY,Vicki H.,5,Great phone for a senior. Wish greatcall had better plans
B01DRV2BBY,Loretta Marie Mancuso,5,The flip phone is easier for my husband to use. Big buttons and large numbers on screen. Everything about the phone makes it easier for seniors. Only downside is that there are no parental controls at all. I need to set up hours in the night when calls can't be made. Not able to do this.
B01DRV2BBY,Mary Pringle,2,I bought this phone for my husband for Christmas and only recently connected it to a carrier. We discovered a week after activating the the phone the ringtones donât work and neither does vibrate when a call comes in.
B01DRV2BBY,Nancy,1,This little Phone Wont hold a charge.
B01DRV2BBY,MAJDave,5,Great phone and plans.
B01DRV2BBY,Helmethead Granny,2,This phone has a mind of its own. It cuts off in the midst of conversations; phones a different number than the one I've entered (usually the number phoned before the new entry). Its last trick was to completely freeze; it couldn't even be turned off. My original Jitterbug flip worked when I visited my kids in Canada. The sales agent assured me that this phone was also good for Canada - NOT SO. You can receive calls from Canada and make calls to Canada (when the phone is in a good mood) but you can NOT use the phone while in Canada. I will be replacing this when I get out of the mountains where a landline is required.
B01DRV2BBY,Kirby A Morgan,2,MY SERVICE WITH GREAT CALL WAS SHUT DOWN WITH OVER 900 MINUTES AND MY BILL IS NOT DUE TILL JULY 23RD. PLEASE EXPLAIN.

I've only been using it for about 2 weeks but

B01DRV2BBY,SAndra Anderson,5,"Easy to use, easy to see, easy to understand, easy to hear, easy to read, easy to use phone book and easy to
love."
B01DRV2BBY,Katy,1,This phone cannot send pictures to other phones. It turns itself off and takes a long time to get it to come back on. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. Sent it back and reactivated the old Samsung. I called Greatcall and they said this phone had these issues.
B01DRV2BBY,Raymond R. Ritter,3,"Can you say ""upsell""? GreatCall - Not so great. Wanted no frills phone. Impossible to get just the basics."
B01DRV2BBY,Angel's Mom,5,Perfect for my husband. Easy to use and see. Would recommend this phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Joe John Garza,4,Works well
B01DRV2BBY,Dawn,5,"Bought this for my 80 yr old dad. It replaced his landline telephone; was ALOT cheaper and I like that he can have his phone on him at all times. The numbers are nice and big, and the phone is very easy for him to use."
B01DRV2BBY,VeroF63,3,I bought this phone for my dad in March 2017 and its been malfunction for the past month. there are no dents or scratches on the phone because my dad have not drop the it. I now have to but anew phone for him
B01DRV2BBY,Lorraine,5,works great.
B01DRV2BBY,Viv,1,Service lags.
B01DRV2BBY,Alla Pecheny,1,Returned. Not working as claimed with ATT.
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara J. Wheat,1,I live in a metropolitan city in the middle of Ohio. Found out after purchasing the phone that Jitterbug is not supported in this area. Be sure you checkout your zip code on their web site before purchasing.
B01DRV2BBY,NickMusic,5,Nice solid phone thanks !
B01DRV2BBY,Mark H,5,Great product and easy to use
B01DRV2BBY,PSSAT,1,Bad sound quality. Too many steps for a senior with cognitive problems - you have to scroll through the numbers and remember to press the Yes/No buttons each time.
B01DRV2BBY,Veronica Kolbenheyer,3,"Having trouble with the phone,keep getting strange phone calls on the number I got.Would like to change to comsumer cellular andget a different number."
B01DRV2BBY,jack s,5,"The Jitterbug is a perfect device for those of us affected by tremor. Very logical, easy, and intuitive to use. The large keys and clear screen are the most important features to me - very helpful."

B01DRV2BBY,donald,1,KEYS DONT WORK
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,The phone worked for two weeks - then the buttons on the phone would no longer work - the phone would not call out. Do not buy this phone!!! Rated minus 5 stars.
B01DRV2BBY,Robert C. Todd,5,It is as advertised.
B01DRV2BBY,Sharon D,5,Bought this for my 95 year old dad. He likes it! Very user friendly and much easier for him to use than the old flip phone from our cell phone carrier.
B01DRV2BBY,Mary M,5,"This is my mom's second Jitterbug phone. The original phone model was great, but this one is even better. The phone is heavier but not so much that it is cumbersome or oversized. The numbers and screen are much bigger. My mom loves that this has a camera and she can send/receive photos. Great Call has amazing customer service as well. Amazon delivery was right on time and perfect as usual. I highly recommend a Jitterbug phone for any older adult who wants to try technology (text and cell phone) but doesn't want anything complicated or unnecessary."
B01DRV2BBY,Leonard T. Pulley,5,Wife loves it. Great for seniors.
B01DRV2BBY,David M Gellatly,5,AAA+++
B01DRV2BBY,Oleg G.,3,Yes No navigation is cool but can be confusing if used to the normal stuff

B01DRV2BBY,Kathleen Coleman,5,is exactly as described
B01DRV2BBY,Maureen,5,"This phone is perfection for senior folks who get a bit confused by icons and lights in smart phones. Keyboard is easy to use and the phone is simple to understand. Customer Service is as good as it gets. Very friendly, knowledgable staff a phone call away. Emergency button is the best on the market today. If 10 stars were available I would give it a ten."
B01DRV2BBY,DENISE NETO,5,the item will be perfect
B01DRV2BBY,Cindy,4,"Bought this for my husband that has been apposed to carrying a cell phone, he is coping well."
B01DRV2BBY,Terry berry,5,Great for my senior aunt who lives alone! I lov all the little extras that I can know she safe 600 miles away from me!
B01DRV2BBY,Pam Childers,5,"I bought this phone for my mother in Rehab whose phone does not work. She can operate this phone easily and can hear when it rings, which she has been unable to hear on any other phone. She loves the red color which was $31 cheaper than the graphite phone. We also bought a carry case also in red that fits this phone perfectly for $9.80 also from Amazon which can be worn cross body so she always has the phone with her. She loves her phone and charges it faithfully every night. Once again she is connected to the outside world and loves it. She is 90 years old. Thanks for the fantastic service. We enabled the 5 star so she can push one button to get help when she needs it and they will contact me to go to her immediately. I cannot be more pleased with this purchase."
B01DRV2BBY,Rose Nunn,1,"This doesn't work in Alaska...I have returned this item on my own expense, i haven't heard if they received my return item. Waiting to hear from them if they received it so i can get a credit back to my credit card."

B01DRV2BBY,kit jones,3,"NEEDS MORE OPTIONS, LIKE VIBRATE AND RING"
B01DRV2BBY,Melissa D.,1,"Unfortunately this Jitterbug flip phone for $79 quit ringing right at 60 days after purchase. I bought it for my grandfather who is blind, cannot make calls but can easily open the phone to accept a call. I was unable to return because he lived in a different state and I would only see him once a month and by then it was past the return date. I did purchase a new jitterbug flip from Greatcall directly although it was more expensive and so far it continues to work. It would be great if they would incorporate a vibrate feature so if my grandfather does not hear it ring (he also has some hearing loss) then at least he could feel it vibrate when it rang. Overall, the phone is the best for elderly folks, simple and easy to work."
B01DRV2BBY,W. Christopher,2,After 5 months the buttons failed and started acting poorly.

Second, the plan counts incoming calls as well as outgoing calls. So, in the case of my 93 year old mom, even if she makes 5 calls out per month, she received more than 700 calls in a month. So, the lowest plan of 200 calls per month is quickly overtaken. And guess what? The charges add up at a rate of 35 cents per call over the limit of 200. As a senior, if you need to figure that out, you're toast in no time.
Third, for seniors, even though it is a simple phone, there is a period of adjustment as learning new skills without the eyesight and dexterity of your youth is pretty difficult. However, it beats the touch screen 4h generation phones, the iphone, and all the other phones hands down."
B01DRV2BBY,Dorothy,5,We are very happy with the jitterbug. Mom loves it! It is easy for her to see the numbers and be able to use it.
B01DRV2BBY,fares h.,1,"Hi dear
I expect to use flip 5o our simcard directly but I found it need to work by difficult steps for me"
B01DRV2BBY,Ed Reiff,4,Great basic phone for the technically challenged. Cost is a little on the high side for what it is but it serves it purpose well.
B01DRV2BBY,julie,1,My mother bought this phone and it never worked really well and finally just died after 2 months. So I don't know what her options are besides changing carriers. She likes the idea of the phone because of the big screen and large font.
B01DRV2BBY,timothy Hills,5,love it
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,it solved all my phone concerns
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Bought this to replace old flip phone. Husband is rough on phones and only uses it for phone calls. This is exactly what he needed. Good phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Vickies Place,5,"I just got the phone. Set up was excellent. Just follow instructions. No complications at all. Love the phone size, the large print. The sound. you can take photos and send to facebook. They ask you if you want too. I have not tried the camera yet. Will today. If displeased, will update. I have not used it much but I know it's good quality and simple. I'm 59, and I'm not into smart phones, etc. Had them, hated them. Don't want to be contacted by every person on my facebook all the time with beeps, etc. Lol. I wanted a simple phone with a simple plan for emergency or necessary contacting only. I like the little stand and I get a free car phone they said which is coming. To purchase and start it all up with activation fee was over $100.00. That does not include minutes. I did not get text but I did get voicemail which is $3.00 extra a month plus tax I imagine. So I'm thinking with the 200 mins plus voicemail it will be close to $20 a month. Not great,not bad. Just is. They gave me time of course but in a few days I will be billed for that. They bill ahead they said. The good thing is I was told the minutes roll over. Love that, cause I don't use my cell hardly at all. So that means if I'm ever without my land phone at home say a power outage, which we are known for, I will have a phone with some time on it. If I change my mind on the phone as time goes by, I will update. But I think I won't. It's just what I wanted."
B01DRV2BBY,carol,5,"I got it for my 98 year old Dad, he loves it!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,K. Goad,5,My husband bought it for his mom to replace her phone that broke
B01DRV2BBY,W. P. Ricks,3,It's ok but needs some work in the contact area of the phaone.
B01DRV2BBY,Southern Belle,1,"I was delighted when my Aunt, from another state, visited and illustrated how well her Jitterbug worked at my place despite our living in what everyone calls a 'dead zone'. We've had lots of different phones; none worked. Her's did! So, although I'd become accustomed to not having a cellphone, I promptly ordered a Jitterbug just like my Aunt owned. I followed the setup and charging instructions and set out with my new phone. But, the battery died after only a couple of hours use! Silly me; surely my own ineptitude, I thought. So, I set it aside and figured I'd try another day, when I had more time to fool with it. It followed the same pattern -- over and over again, unfortunately. Now, of course, I wasn't paying attention and it's too late to return it."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,My mom got her phone 2 days later. She likes it a lot. The keys are bigger and the speaker is louder.
B01DRV2BBY,ch,1,"Verizon stores do not program this phone.
Bought it through Verizon website. (When I clicked phone to purchase, it automatically went to Amazon website). Have to return phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Fast Eddie,4,as advertised
B01DRV2BBY,Grandad,3,"Still to complicated for very old-timers. Also, the 5* button calls 911 if you don't activate it for 5*."
B01DRV2BBY,Robert nuttall,3,Not as well made as they say. the sound and buttons are good for older people..but..One drop IN the case and it will not charge or work
B01DRV2BBY,dimples,1,"RETURNED, COULDN'T PROGRAM"
B01DRV2BBY,elizabeth,4,Good for the purpose big numbers for easy view.
B01DRV2BBY,Rach,5,I got this for my mother who is not savvy with electronics. It was easy to show her how to use it. And the numbers are large enough for her to see
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,The phone is too large. It has a loud annoying dial tone that cannot be adjusted. Its not very practical. Really just for people with very poor vision.
B01DRV2BBY,Peggy Cole,5,Got it for my sister to upgrade from older jitterbug flip. She loves it. Speaker good and loud and the charging cradle is easy
B01DRV2BBY,Bob,5,GREAT PHONE!!!
B01DRV2BBY,sheila anderson-mochrie,5,Great phone. Easy to use.
B01DRV2BBY,david lontine,3,"I am still getting use to it. For me, the best thing, was the louder, speaker phone..
I am still learning"
B01DRV2BBY,Opal Hocker,5,My husband is so pleased so far. He gets good reception with it where we live. and he likes the simple features.
B01DRV2BBY,S Janeen Ellison,5,This phone is EXCELLENT for those who are not fond of modern technology. The phone is well made and very easy to use. Their customer support is OUTSTANDING!

B01DRV2BBY,Bruce James,5,Easy to handle and has a feel to the touch. I also like the ease of access.
B01DRV2BBY,Ericka B,4,I thought for a senior phone the ringtone would be a lot louder but besides that a good phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Lydia,1,This goes for the the Jitter Bug Smart and The Jitterbug easy flip! CRAP!
B01DRV2BBY,Sue DesRochers,5,Very good description for its easy use! My friend bought one and I soon followed..anyo e can use this phone easily.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,To start out not only do you have pay full price for the phone. You also have to pay $35 to activate it. Then pay for the plan plus additional fees plus sales tax. Mine amounted to 19.95 plus $5.00 in fees and tax per month making this cell network no deal at all.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"2 dead phones in 3 months , very light useage . Don't waste your money . Amazon bought and nicely replaced , but still junk. Great Call absolutely no help. Their brand if bought from anyone else, they supply no help service. Just airtime and as cheap as it is , if the phone does not work who needs them!"
B01DRV2BBY,Donna,5,The large numbers make it easy for my elderly mother to use.
B01DRV2BBY,David,1,Cheap quality

B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,My Mother is very happy with it.
B01DRV2BBY,kutty,5,Very easy to learn and use. Glad I got it. Just need to slow down punching keys.
B01DRV2BBY,Gene Manning,5,I like the fact that the phone is compact. I like the fact that it is not a smart phone. I like the easy to numbers.
B01DRV2BBY,Anna Carmichael,5,My husband finds it quite suitable.
B01DRV2BBY,JF,5,Great phone for my elderly Mom. Large buttons make it easy to use.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,love the phone i ordered it for my mother the cord works but the base does not work. Very disappointed in that

B01DRV2BBY,dave hoolihan,3,"I bought the phone for my mother who is elderly she likes it a lot,the only negative is the customer service when setting up the account,the girl was very rude and unprofessional.i talked to the supervisor who wasn't much better.they have a good product with poor customer service."
B01DRV2BBY,G Hogan,4,Fine phone for purposed intended.
B01DRV2BBY,Keith Nelson,3,Does not work correctly
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,3,"The phone was ordered for our mom. She loves the phone, the menu is easy to use, and the buttons are large. The drawback to this phone is the GreatCall team. Do not buy this phone if you are planning on paying for the calling plan from overseas - the website doesn't accept foreign billing addresses or telephone numbers. Do not try and call them to activate the phone, as they will confuse you, read off a script with no flexibility, and upsell you expensive options you do not need. They even hung up directly after mentioning a $4 monthly charge without saying what it was for. We had to call back and ask what it was, and then request they take it off the bill. With all the computer activation, phone activation, re-calling, etc., it took over half a day. It's a nice product, one that we need, but do not let your senior parents try to activate it at all - the customer experience is frustrating, confusing, expensive, time-consuming, and just plain awful."
B01DRV2BBY,jerry dewitt,1,"This phone is nuts, it locks up, it is not old coot friendly, I just want to make a call but I have to go thru all the menu garbage to select the call function, CRAP"
B01DRV2BBY,Gary Pierceall,5,perfect for my 90 year old mother!
B01DRV2BBY,Brian N.,1,"More complicated for a older senior, going back to his old flip phone. Functions not really to use."

Phone just died. Note, my husband has same phone in different color, we have joint usage, service on autopay. My phone just quit!"
B01DRV2BBY,Lturtles,3,"Was too confusing for my 91 y/o mom to use. I had a terrible time getting the network carrier to release my mom's phone number. I would give great call an (F). Talked to 6 different customer service specialist, 2 Supervisor through a 17 days period and about about 10 hrs being on the phone with their company. Bless AT&T for helping me and trying to put the many code that great all gave me . So I'm back to a landline for my mom."

B01DRV2BBY,George Briggs,1,That phone is absolutely no good for use in AUSTRALIA
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,I brought this for my mother
B01DRV2BBY,Terri J.,1,"I purchased this for my mother. She is elderly and visually impaired, so I thought the Jitterbug would be good for her. Not the case. No ability to use voice commands as there are on other flip phones. When I called, I was told this was not a current feature with Great Call service. I returned the Jitterbug and replaced with a Verizon filp phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Sue Goldman,3,There is a noticeable delay after pressing the button.
B01DRV2BBY,ALLISOND,1,This item DID NOT INCLUDE THE CHARGER as stated in details
B01DRV2BBY,Kerry M. Jackson,5,"Easy to see,easy to use. Great phone for seniors and others who just want to make and receive calls."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,"LOVE THE BIG SCREEN AND BUTTONS. LOVE THE SIMPLICITY. LOVE THE COLOR. I AM NOT A CELL PHONE USER, CAN'T STAND THE WAY THEY HAVE TURNED PEOPLE INTO ADDICTED ZOMBIES. GOT THIS FOR MY OWN SAFETY IN CASE MY CAR BREAKS DOWN. RECEPTION COULD BE BETTER."
B01DRV2BBY,Sofia Bratsis,5,I love the big numbers on this phone you can see who is calling.
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara A. Hines,3,"Mine is not much different than my touch phone. It's ok, but not thrilled."

B01DRV2BBY,Margot Brisbin,1,This can't be used in Canada
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Easy to set up and use
B01DRV2BBY,WJMT,4,"This was a gift for my 86 year-old mother and she loves it. It is super easy to use,since it's just like her older flip phone.The volume is loud enough for her to hear, and numbers are large so she can easily see them.
The only complaint is that the photos that are texted to her are usually too large to fit her screen format, so often, heads are cut off or arms are missing."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Worst customer service I have ever experienced My daughter set up my 88 nearly blind fathers account. After my father couldn't even open the smooth flip phone I sent it back. No problem with sending the phone back but the service they have you use is great call. Great call will not let you cancell the service unless the senior citizen is present and allows it. My daughter had all of the info including account number. Card number catbird PIN number secret Id questions and answers ....... My father is currently in the hospital. The great call gentleman ended the call by hanging up on my daughter Amazon I would discontinue this product.
B01DRV2BBY,miranda nembo,5,bought it for my mom

B01DRV2BBY,don grab,3,got rid of it
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,easy to use....once you read the instruction booklet....
B01DRV2BBY,Suus,5,"I bought this for my 92 year old mother. She has severe arthritis, so using a touch screen phone is next to impossible for her. This has buttons to scroll and select and buttons for the numbers so that you can feel you are pushing them. The screen has great contrast so the writing/numbers are easily seen. The flip open phone is perfect so that she can keep it in her pocket without accidentally calling, and it also makes it easier to answer. I programmed in the numbers she will need most often. She has used it without difficulty. I do recommend for the elderly."
B01DRV2BBY,Prospero Ruiz,1,El telÃ©fono estÃ¡ bloqueado
B01DRV2BBY,Tina Rhinehart,2,"I bought this for my 83 yr old mom, it appeared to be easier to use than most regular flip phones, but it's not.
Most seniors with memory issues need a VERY SIMPLE to use phone....I haven't been able to find anything simple & easy to use."
B01DRV2BBY,Kenn,5,Big Buttons

B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"So disappointing. Came up as unlocked but when tried to add to current carrier found out that great call was locked to phone. We get crummy reception, everyone says sounds like a fishbowls husband has terrible time with it and settings are so limited. Almost ready to go back to Smaller phone. HATE IT"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,love the phone but wish the ringer was a bit louder.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,great phone-love it!!
B01DRV2BBY,laura,1,"It was a nightmare! Advertised wrong! Lost $ in shipping to me, & in sending it back, due to ad incorrect!! But jitterbug people VERY helpful once u got through to them. Quality phone, just not for me."
B01DRV2BBY,Richard Hurt,2,"After owning many different models of Jitterbug phones by Samsung over the last 5 years, this new one by Alcatell is terrible. First the ringer is far too quiet for an older user. It's set at max ringer and the best you can do is lay the phone on it's face to hope to hear it when it rings. Doesn't matter the ring tone set. Second, and the worst part about this phone is that unless it's held just perfectly, noone can hear on the other end. It's muffled and inaudible. This is a serious flaw for an older person in my opinion. I was reluctant to buy this phone since a different manufacturer than the previous models but I gave it a try. Unfortunately there's some much needed improvements to be made on this one.
On another note not related to the phone. I've had to call Greatcall(Jitterbug) for various reasons over the years and it's always been a smooth, pleasant experience. With this phone I've had to call several times to try and relieve the issues I've had, and I've been met with the recording ""we're experiencing unusually high call volume today, for faster service please call back another time"". Now this has gone on every day for a week and the wait times are very long. 30 minutes so far. And the representatives are short and come off hurried. I'm getting the feeling these are starting to slide at Greatcall unfortunately.

There are a couple plus' I can give. This one is actually USB capable. I can transfer my photos from my phone to the PC which the other models I've owned cannot. Also the reading magnifier MIGHT come in handy, but I'm returning the phone before I could actually use it realistically."
B01DRV2BBY,Sally,1,"The first two did not work after one day and the third (yes, I am slow learner) became so S L O W that I was not able to operate it. This was after
a week or so. I think the red ones are a bad batch or are at least with my experience. My husband has a jitterbug that works wonderfully so not sure why this group was so defective."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,3,Hidden charges and unexpected fees (when signing up for monthly plans which the only advertised 14.99 plan doesn't initially disclose) once the phone is received. Everything seems to be an UPCHARGE! Works well but doesn't provide any internet access. For an 80 year old so returning the phone is more hassle than keeping it at this point. I expected a bit more considering the phone was a bit pricey to begin with.
B01DRV2BBY,Eliezar ben Label,1,Returned phone. Connection process too difficult for senior. Get a tech person to call for you.
B01DRV2BBY,Olivia N.,5,Perfect phone for my Father.
B01DRV2BBY,Janet,5,"I love this phone. Had a trac phone but everything was too small to read easily. Complicated instructions for use. But the Jitterbug is just the opposite! Big keys with big letters and words and numbers, so easy to learn to use immediately. Has a dial tone which I found adorable. Haven't learned how to text or use the camera yet, but haven't taken the time. Meanwhile it is so easy to use to make calls. I love it! If you are as technology impaired as I am, plus my aging eyes aren't that great, by all means this is a great phone."
B01DRV2BBY,rns,4,"Excellent delivery, product as advertised! My mom loves it. Set up relatively easy with customer support. Would have given it 5 stars except for it being a little heavy and you need a computer to save part of activation cost."
B01DRV2BBY,Helen,5,"I bought two of the Jitterbug Flips for my parents. My mom has vision issues so the big screen is a huge help for her. My dad loves the fact that it is so easy to use. They aren't hard on their phones and my dad has already procured phone holders to protect them (local swap meet).

Instead of setting up an account online I placed a call to their customer service so that I could get both phones on one account (I didn't know if that would be an issue online). I almost fell off the couch when a real live person answered the phone! I am very impressed with GreatCall and their customer service. Their call centers are based in the US, with calls answered quickly by knowledgeable reps.

She walked me through the account process, answered all my questions and had every thing set up in about 15 minutes. I love the idea of the 5 star service (they can press a button and have emergency services called, or even a family member contacted) phones have gps and you can ping the phones location from their website. We'll see how the phones hold up, but the customer service is amazing and you can't put a price on that."
B01DRV2BBY,LJ Capone,1,"My Mom had this phone for 45 days and it quit working. I've never had a cell phone go bad and this is supposed to be the end all phone for seniors.

What a piece of Junk."
B01DRV2BBY,PelicanPower,3,Second attempt to improve my elderly family members phone experience. Button controls not intuitive.could not guess at commands for actions
B01DRV2BBY,Shammara Amison,2,"I bought this phone for my blind father and he likes how heavy the phone feels compared to his old ones. He doesn't like that the phone doesn't talk to him like his old phones did, it made it easier for him to navigate the phone. We thought by getting a phone that was geared towards the elderly that this phone would have functions to better serve him but it he doesn't think so."
B01DRV2BBY,V Lopez,4,Big keys & display makes it easy to see & use for mom.
B01DRV2BBY,wellmaybe,3,Works most of time but problematic. Have to remove and reinsert battery rather frequently to get it to operate. When it works it's good enough.
B01DRV2BBY,Mel,5,"Very nice phone , great idea, good price, & fast shipping!"
B01DRV2BBY,Rob and Amy,5,"Initially tried another flip phone option for my 94 year old dad, but the Jitterbug Flip was so much easier for him to learn. The user friendly menu and prompts are hassle free, nice large screen, easy to use buttons, and the 5star option is a great peace of mind."
B01DRV2BBY,Eddie,2,"the phone has started locking up randomly and this is very frustrating for my elderly father. I have to remove the battery to reset the phone. Also, the charging port doesn't make contact with the phone well, so we have to disconnect the port and use the cable directly to charge the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Mark J. Wolfe,1,"The Jitterbug phone is a nice phone but it takes advantage of the elderly it cost more after you get it for example.
It cost for activation,cost for the five star and the more minutes you going to get the more it's going to cost
so be very careful when you purchase it."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,Not happy with trying to set up plan for my mom. They kept pushing to try and have me spend more on a plan. At the beginning the service lady kept saying all that was included but they were all at an increase plan price!!!!Camera quality is poor! The pictures do not compare to what is pictured in add. I also asked about a plan thru Verizon and they said no.....wanted to keep my mom's old number. When I went to Verizon to cx her existing phone they told me I could have kept it!!! I will not be purchasing another one in the future
B01DRV2BBY,Jeff S,1,This is a piece of crap. $70 for something that only has a battery life of 12 hours. Be aware before you buy this!!!!!
B01DRV2BBY,Abbos,1,"DO NOT CONSIDER BUYING THIS ITEM AT ALL! YOU CANT USE OTHER OPERATORS WITH THIS PHONE. VERIZON IS GONNA CHARGE YOU A LOT. UNLIM TALK AND MESSAGE IS 75$, WHAT, I PAY 25 PER MONTH FOR UNLIM!!! I AM GONNA RETURN THIS INCREADIBLY EXPENSIVE STUFF."
B01DRV2BBY,Cynthia Moran,1,Did not activate - returned to manufacturer for replacement.
B01DRV2BBY,StormMaster,2,"Not for old, older people. Wanted a basic flip phone and this has more."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,It was activated by another customer and sent back. I couldn't activate it.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,This phone is the worst phone Ive ever owned. Ive been with great call for over 10 years. The Samsung flip phones were the best. This is the worst. The display doest light up right away sometimes taking up to 30 seconds to come on. The camera and magnifier are worthless. Neither one works well. Sometimes the dail tone wont come on for up to 30 seconds. The ringer adjustment doesnt work very well. It seems the phone is getting worse everyday. I dont use a cell very much and Ive only had this phone for about a month. I want the Samsung phones back. I hope great call can help when I call about this phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,2,"Bought it for my elderly father. Set-up was far too difficult for him, and there is a charge for everything, including Voice Mail. The package deals offered don't really exist, as all they allow is phone calls; no voicemail, texting, etc. It costs 10 cents per picture to send or receive pictures. Entering phone numbers into the Phone Book is very clumsy, as is Voice Dial. The phone isn't loud enough for a senior who is hard of hearing. One has to request Voice Dial, as it isn't automatically included, even though it's free. The Voice Dial stopped working twice, and we had to get the phone replaced, going through the set-up all over again. Any senior smart enough to set up this phone is smart enough to use an iPhone, with far less aggravation. Buyer beware!"
B01DRV2BBY,Saad Nafai,1,"Hello to everyone using Amazon. Don't buy this kind of phone you will just waste your money specially if you are not living in ðºð¸. This phone doesn't work over sea like UAE. I have followed the instructions to activate the phone no result. Then I call support service from USA :*they put me on 15mn two times. At last one service agent lady :we are sorry if you are not in USA we can't activate your phone.!!!??? ð How is it possible this JITTBURG Company doesn't explain to Amazon that this phone can't be activate oversea.!!???, or I guess they dont just care both.. Let's just sale the product and make money. Customer goes to hell.."
B01DRV2BBY,esprg,5,nice had to return it ... unfortunately could not use on ATT so no need to keep it.
B01DRV2BBY,Average person,2,Customer service says there's *no way* to turn off amber alerts. Not everyone wants to hear about the latest kidnapping that happened 400 miles away. Surely this can be changed . . .
B01DRV2BBY,Gardening,5,"Phone is great has loud ring, unfortunately my hubby fell in the lake and his phone was in his pocket. I phoned Great call and am getting a new one (not free) but he gets to keep his same phone number."
B01DRV2BBY,Ntwalk,4,Mom really likes it. I barely have to go over and show her how to turn it on and off anymore.
B01DRV2BBY,mlong,1,cute little phone but received at least 8 solicitation calls a day and received many calls from people getting a wrong number or thinking my number was someone's else. I sent it back.
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,3,Not so easy for an elderly with beginning symptoms of dementia
B01DRV2BBY,Sarcastic shopper,1,Good phone. But the service is awful
B01DRV2BBY,Joy from Texas,2,"It is not ""Easy-to-Use""! It is difficult to go from iPhone to this."
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,3,"Might be a good phone, but when we tried to set it up, were told services not available in our area!"
B01DRV2BBY,Rob Hartigan,1,"can't give a zero, I received 5 jump ropes instead of the phone. Returning and hopefully all will be made right"
B01DRV2BBY,J. Voelkle,5,"Great basic flip phone. Easy to set up with the carrier. Easy to use-- big buttons and only the buttons absolutely necessary (#1-0, Yes, No, & up/down scroll arrows). Can store 50 numbers. Good speaker so easy to hear. And cheap if you don't need to talk a lot (I pay about $15+tax monthly for 100 minutes)."
B01DRV2BBY,shelly,4,The phone is perfect for my computer challenged dad but there customer service is horrible.
B01DRV2BBY,Michael Statham,3,Does not hold charge compared to previous model.
B01DRV2BBY,B.N. Herrera,5,"Looks good. got it for my mom, I think she will like it"

B01DRV2BBY,Jeanetta Thomas-King,5,My husband loves his flip phone!
B01DRV2BBY,Cynthia Harrison,5,"My husband loves the phone! Easy set up, solid feel, good reception. Large easy to read numbers and letters. Great call is easy to use. Very reasonable calling rates. No more complaints!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Classynoni,5,Purchased this for my Mom who is 79 years old and needed something with larger buttons and display.....She loves it!

B01DRV2BBY,Debi,5,"This is a great phone for folks that need a ""yes/no"" way to interact with their phone. It has good clarity, big numbers and is easy to use. Both my mother (with dementia) and my mother-in-law enjoy this phone. My mother's on her third jitterbug and my mother-in-law is on her third. All upgrades over time. Great Product!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jeanette Sullivan,5,Gift for my mother and father. They love it!

B01DRV2BBY,Raquel,5,So far so good!
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,like it very much. lost my book and can;t figure out how to erase old calls.
B01DRV2BBY,Joni R. Jackson,3,There is nothing wrong with the phone. But the senior for whom I purchased it can no longer use it. I did not return it because I had opened the package (but did not charge the battery or activate the phone). I have an expensive tiny doorstop.
B01DRV2BBY,A. Pellera,1,"Good phone, cruel , cruel service at Great Call. I purchased the phone, I activated the phone, but somehow I am not authorized to pay the bill without having my hospitalized mother call and add me to the account. An account I created for a phone I purchased. Mom is 2000 miles away in a hospital unable to make calls because of these jerks. Buyer beware of the fact that you are stuck with crappy customer service. The added stress of having a rude customer service agent was the last straw. The people at great call are cruel, inhumane and do not deserve your business or mine. I can't express enough how much pain they have caused me and my infirmed mother. Do not get involved with this company, they are bad people and are uninterested in helping you when you are helpless."
B01DRV2BBY,Tammy M Jamieson,4,My mom does love this phone (she is 73) she is blind in one eye so the big numbers and ease of use is good the only down side is the ring is not very loud. Otherwise a great phone. Watch out for plan prices some are a little steep for areas that may not receive good service.
B01DRV2BBY,DGNAZ,2,I did not like cause I would have to go with their provider and I wanted to use mine. Plus there was no sim card and they would not replace it. So I sent it back
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"The phone does not work properly now - won't ring, doesn't connect. Can't return because it's past the 30 days."
B01DRV2BBY,David Dylan Sumner,5,Great phone and easy to use.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Easy to use and good quality.

B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,I was assuming I could install SIM card from my current phone and be able to use my ATT service plan Wrong jitterbug is exclusive only to their plan.
B01DRV2BBY,Teresa B. Gallegos,5,80 year old Dad finally has a phone he can use!
B01DRV2BBY,jimmer,4,I was wrong. received ok.
B01DRV2BBY,Margaret A Rushing,1,Stopped working three weeks after activating it. Won't buy another one. Amazon was good about refunding me.
B01DRV2BBY,Joan Stol,5,"I have vision problems and it is just what I was looking for.

B01DRV2BBY,Mike1254,5,Great phone for the price.
B01DRV2BBY,J. koval,5,"Nice, easy to set up, operate & see. I was charged for few text messages (add'l cost) that were not mine. If you request Great Call to disable texting, they are unable to automatically update the phone. So, you will not want to do that. Bugs me to pay $24. Monthly that will only be used maybe once a month."
B01DRV2BBY,JENNIFER E.,1,"Horrible. Got this for my dad. He is on his 5th phone. When I called for him a few times I was not pleased with customer service at Great Call. I would have returned it but he likes the layout, but I think it's crap. Sometimes I can't even hear him. Goes in and out. Really bad for an elderly man who lives alone to or have a phone that works."
B01DRV2BBY,james,5,"I purchased this phone for mother , she is very happy"
B01DRV2BBY,Phillylatina,1,"I was very pleased with the phone until I found out after purchasing it that it did not have coverage in Puerto Rico and 2 hours into purchasing the phone, I could not cancel the order. This phone would've been great for my ailing Mother in Puerto Rico to stay in touch with loved ones on a simple to use phone. Letters, numbers, commands and monthly payments are perfect for ailing Seniors. Downfall, no coverage outside of US grounds. I still do recommend this phone here in US"
B01DRV2BBY,Emily Bowen,5,I got it for a friend and he loves it. It's so easy for him to use.
B01DRV2BBY,Angel Girl,1,"Aug 4- Another FAULTY ""JITTERBUG"" Phone for our MOM in NursingHome ! ( Her only lifeline to outside World in emergency)-- (1) Our 10th FAULTY ""Jitterbug"" Phone in 9 months !!! (2) Repeatedly UNABLE to RECEIVE calls & DIAL OUT !! (3) Ultra loud Ring-Tone that turns itself on & plays over & over again without any Call coming in, (4) Our CALLS repeatedly INTERCEPTED by odd VERIZON message: "" Welcome to Verizon Wireless. The Verizon Wireless Customer you called is NOT AVAILABLE at this time. Please try your call later. Announcement ""1 switch 2 dash 3 1"". ( Then the call DISCONNECTS ) .. Makes it impossible to reach dear Mom in Nursing Home !! .. Very ODD .. this is the 8th Item out of 15 items we purchased in past 2 weeks that has been faulty !!! Sadly, 20% of our purchases have been faulty last 4 months !!"
B01DRV2BBY,Nancy Holden,5,works great for my parents
B01DRV2BBY,ehobz,2,"I may update the review later, but so far, I'm not impressed. The phone itself is as I expected -- big buttons, big fonts -- but the signal strength has been very, very poor. I don't live in the boonies, so that shouldn't be a factor, but even traveling around, the signal has been so spotty as to be unusable. Many times it won't even ring or place calls because the signal is so poor. Perhaps GreatCall has a remedy. If conditions improve, I'll update this review."
B01DRV2BBY,Sharon J. Logan,5,"Easy to read messages, easy to use and perfect for what I needed."
B01DRV2BBY,"Dennis Holt,Sr.",5,Just as advertised.
B01DRV2BBY,JoeB,3,"The phone's feel, keypad, and easy reading are wonderful. The menu system and user interface is confusing rather than simple. It takes too many keystrokes to execute many functions such as ""Delete Message"", etc. The ""Yes"", ""No"" buttons are poorly named in many of the menu contexts. There appears to be no simple method for finding a name in the address book if you use a long list of addresses.
The HELP guide does not include instructions on how to search for and/or call a person who is listed in the address book. This is an oversight from which I form a negative impression of the user-friendliness of the product.

Reception at our home is bad. We are probably in a shadow of the network. It is mostly for this one reason that we are returning the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Ordered Flip phone for my 87 year old Mom. Could not get to activate. Spent 2 hours on support with GreatCall (what an oxymoron that is). They were useless. Went after 8PM CST and Customer Support Person told me to call back in the AM when they were typically reading magazines because they were not as busy. How many tech people read magazines? Even if I can get it to activate not sure I trust giving it to my Mom. Anticipate it would be major frustration for her.
B01DRV2BBY,evie liltwok,1,Do notably this phone. I bought it for my mother and she couldn't use the key pad. IT'S NOT $14.99- the advertisement on the box is a lie.
B01DRV2BBY,dht,5,Quick delivery. Dad loves it.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,I don't feel the jitterbug is out there to help the elderly and they won't unlock her phone so other carriers can work with them so everything is fine no stars The only reason he has one star is because if you don't market least one then you can't leave this review but actually if I could do it I put no stars no stars no stars
B01DRV2BBY,Sue B.,2,I'm a senior & thought the phone would be just the answer for me. I had a smart phone that had all kinds of problems with the quality of it.I had some problems with this Jitterbug trying to connect.I ended up purchasing another phone from Consumer Cellular but kept the jitterbug for emergencies after I had bent the contacts in it.I don't think I will ever buy a phone online though but let the salesman set it up & get the bugs out.I like the sixe of the flip phone but the quality of the one I got was not the best.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Very Happy
B01DRV2BBY,Cindy,1,"Got this for my husband as it has big numbers and is suppose to be easy to work and hear. This is the second one that we are having a problem with as it is very slow to activate when you open to make a call. Also it is very hard to hear the ring and conversations are not clear or easy to hear.
I have contacted Great Call and after an hour on the phone they are telling me that if it continues to happen they will do a warranty on it. I am wondering if I just get a different phone that you can hear and will not have all these problems."
B01DRV2BBY,Jerracus,3,"The main problem I have with this phone is that it navigates slowly through it's menus. For such a basic phone I would think it be a lot simpler to scroll through the menu but it has a noticeable lag.

Another annoyance is that Verizon does not carrie this as a service provider so I had to get service through Great Call (the makers of the phone) which runs off of Verizon cell towers.

Also this phone is not good for people with arthritis as it is designed in a very streamlined way which makes it difficult to open the flip phone.

Lastly, the ringer volume is not very impressive with it's ringtone selections. So if you are hard of hearing this might be difficult for you to use."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,Big. Umbers and ease of use
B01DRV2BBY,bamai,5,called my home phone and it ask for a credit card why

B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"For the digitally indifferent or challenged, this is the perfect phone.
I don't like to be busy on the phone when I'm out and about, so this works great for me.
It makes and receives calls, takes pictures, lists your numbers, and looks good. It will also call you to make sure you're still vertical. Apps live on my laptop at home."

B01DRV2BBY,William S.,5,"Excellent.

B01DRV2BBY,grateful music maven,5,As easy to use as described. Has some excellent features for calling for help. This is my first cellphone. I purchased it in case of emergency. I feel a bit more secure carrying it on my belt. (case brought separately elsewhere)
B01DRV2BBY,Clara Deese,2,"Didn't have a chance to use it beacuse I was in the wrong time zone, If anyone is looking for a cell ph-they should go their website to see if there is coverage where you're using it it will save you a lot of time trying to activate it."

B01DRV2BBY,redonthehead,1,I was disappointed in the Jitterbug phone.....for one thing it didn't have the options I was used to on my other LG flip phone. I put in over 70 phone numbers in directory and then found I had to use up and down arrows to scan thru all of them to get the number I wanted to call. on my old flip phone all I had to do was put first two letters of the name and it went to that person immediately. I just will be going back to my old phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,My uncle didn't like it so he gave it back to. How do I return it

B01DRV2BBY,ANUBIS,1,Impossible to get service from Micky Mouse companby. You'll buy yourself a headache.
B01DRV2BBY,bill holman,4,thphone meets my needs. I was disappointed that I had to pay additional fees to turn on the phone. I thought AMAZON had indicated that the start up fees were included in the purchase. I don't text but do receive messages. I am a senior citizen andI don't seem to be able to operate the SMART phones like all my kids. It works fine and has great volume. It could use a few additional features but I can send and receive calls when needed. BILL
B01DRV2BBY,Carolina salcedo,3,"we cannot share photos on facebook through the computer, after we have taken them, because its missing a component, or wire.maybe the phone is too small, I bought one."
B01DRV2BBY,Dawna L.,1,Did not work with Verizon as advertised!!! Returned it.
B01DRV2BBY,JME,1,"Was hoping this flip phone and its alleged increased volume boost would help my 87 year old mom. It didn't. Ringer volume is standard and earpiece volume average as well. Sound is better on her old Motorola. However the bigger problem was the phone didnt get a strong signal despite being in well populated areas that are fully serviced with cell towers everywhere. Signal always read POOR. More than 50 percent of the calls didnt go through at all. Lastly, I saw the 74.99 price on line but called Great Call to order. The slick salesman charged me $99 for the phone and when i corrected him to 74.99 he did the used car saleman line of ""Oh well Im not sure. I will have to go see if my manager can find a way to grant that price"". Oh really?? Spare me. After that dog and pony show the manager was ""Kind"" enough to charge the advertised price. Also be aware that even though plans start at enticing levels of 14.99 and up, you will get charged for all extras...like texting which is a separate monthly fee. Rather quickly your monthly bill adds up to numbers that are no longer great deals. Now that I am returning it Great call sends an email which warns ""the phone must be like brand new"" and only then will they determine if/whether a refund will be offered. The phone isnt even a week old. Id say that is brand new. Not happy with the phone or the customer service reps. I would not recommend. One star because negative stars arent an option."
B01DRV2BBY,Dick Cook,3,I wanted to use the phone with AT&T but it was locked to Great Call. I had to return it. I think it is a really good phone but the Great Call service person was not up to snuff.
B01DRV2BBY,ann cassel,2,"Disappionted, no internet on jitterbug."
B01DRV2BBY,Wendy M.,1,This phone has no slot to add a wrist/camera strap so there is no way to attach the phone to a lanyard. Most other flip phones have a little slot built into the phone to feed the end of the strap into and through the phone. I wish they would make the phone with the slot. There are no cases for this phone that allow you to use it in the charging cradle with a case added to the phone. For people with limited mobility who need to wear the phone on a lanyard and use the cradle - there is currently no way to do this.
B01DRV2BBY,jose hill,5,Hi
B01DRV2BBY,deb,1,"Had the Jitterbug about 7 months. I'm only on the 200 minutes per month plan so the phone gets very little use. I have always suspected it is not new. Maybe one someone else had and returned.

This review is in 3 parts:

BEGINNING: Worked fine for about two months.

MIDDLE: Problems started. 1. Phone would not ring. Found ring was delayed. Phone rang 5 or 6 times on callers end before my phone finally started to ring so, if I didn't answer fast they had already hung up. 2. Phone would not come on. It's supposed to come when opened but it didn't. Pressed the Off/On button but still didn't come on. Finally comes on but then the Up/Down buttons for the menu don't do anything. They finally start working. 3. I wasn't signed up for text messages. Still, I got 3 or 4 texts a month from people I didn't know and a charge for each call was added to my bill. I called Greatcall to get text message capability taken off the phone. They made it a pain in the patoot to remove something I said I didn't want in the first place. Obviously, just a way for them to add a few cents to the bill each month. 4. Started noticing phone wouldn't hang up. Closing phone should cause it to hang up but the last couple weeks I noticed I would close it and still hear sounds coming from it so would have to open and close again to get it to hang up. 5. I charged phone yesterday. This morning I tried to use phone but it is completely dead. So, I put it back on charger which makes the display screen come on to tell me phone is charging. Display screen is blank. No sign of life. It's just a flat rock.

END: Today I Will Happily Call GreatCall and Tell Them I No Longer Want Their Hunk of Junk Phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Nancy H.,2,I have not activated it because I was unaware that I had to get a monthly plan. I had planned on getting a minutes card for my husband to use. I also am unhappy about having to have a $30 activation fee. I cannot truly evaluate the use of the phone. I would have sent it back but my husband discarded the inside packaging.
B01DRV2BBY,Samson S.,1,Terrible phobe but my bad I didn't return it. It was a gift for my mother. When I went to use it was barely functional she never used it hardly. Should have looked closer from the start.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"perfect for the intend user (91 years of age). Easy to use and I like the yes or no feature buttons. I also like the available of the specialized call notification and assistance service, We are considering implementing at a later date."
B01DRV2BBY,Marlene Rowe,1,returned product - unable to activate with Verizon
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,This phone has been returned for credit.Not compatible Australian standard
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Can not used with my TMobil account
B01DRV2BBY,Vonne,1,"Although I did not purchase the phone through Amazon, doing so would have helped me deal with one problem: dealing with Great Call. Unfortunately, there are so many incredible problems with Great Call, not dealing with them for one issue is not nearly helpful enough. Needless to say if my grandma could use another phone easily, we'd have already switched, we're in the process of a change for her safety because this company continually leaves her unsafe. As it is, they've put her in danger, leaving her without service for days with a fully paid bill; sent her a new phone in an empty box-no chargers, info booklets, nothing; repeatedly sent the wrong devices or sent the devices to the wrong address (me in AZ rather than her in TX); repeat rote answers about being helpful when it's the last thing this company is; worse, they have a monopoly on this type of service where the core base are seniors and they do not care, at all, about these customers as human beings- our loved ones. Repeatedly- wrong services, wrong devices, cutting off service on the current phone BEFORE the new one arrives and is set up (leaving my grandma in her 90's without service for FIVE days); zero communication or problem solving skills by the reps or the supervisors who only read from rote answers in front of them; hours that are not helpful (supervisors do not work weekends and are difficult to reach); and the option to ""press the 5 star button if this is an emergency"" when we called after hours did NOTHING- no one ever answered. I'm not only a family member, I'm a registered nurse. They would call her on a daily basis telling her to do and eat things against medical advice. This company does not have these seniors as a priority and unless you have back up plans, your loved one could be in danger if relying on this phone and their services."
B01DRV2BBY,brandy,1,"bought the jitterbug phone about a year ago (late 2017) and signed up with GreatCall as the provider for my service. Just recently (August 2018) I terminated the service when I bought a new phone of a different brand and changed service provider. A very short time later, I called GreatCall to assess what my final charges would be for ending the service. I was informed that I would have to pay the ""full amount"" of monthly service billing, even though I only used approx. 7 to 8 days of that term period. I asked . . . ""Do you (GreatCall) not make any adjustments on the last billing when someone chooses to terminate the service?"" They said ""No"". I feel this is robbery. I in good faith call them up, wanted to make my final payment for service that I used, but they said I still had to pay the full amount. Even if you used only one day of the service out of the term billing - you have to pay the full amount charges! This is crazy! I just had to express this review to YOU, the reader, if you are a potential buyer of GreatCall Jitterbug what you should expect when you wish to terminate service with this provider. Again, if GreatCall is reading this - - this is wrong! I will spread the word that You Are A Money Rip Off!"
B01DRV2BBY,S. Shaw,1,"I bought this phone for my husband last year. Since the first day we had trouble getting phone calls. It would signal a missed call, but wouldn't ring or we couldn't call out because it wouldn't turn on when opened (flip style). I called CS the second time and they said it must be a battery problem and sent a new battery. When that didn't change anything they said they had been having trouble with the batteries and asked us to just take the battery out and reinstall it anytime it would not work. (That turned out to be most of the time.) They said they were working on the problem and that we would get an email when the problem was resolved. That was about 9 months or so ago. We are so fed up with this phone and totally frustrated! (I know, I know, why did it take so long to complain and get rid of it!) Both busyness and laziness involved in waiting so long. We are getting rid of it now and we would never think about getting another jitterbug phone! Too bad, because the idea is GREAT but it is not worth it! I am finding there are other phones that are compatible for electronically challenged seniors. ANYTHING else has to be better than this phone!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jim B.,1,"I am not sure that I can convey just what a horrible experience this phone has been - a disaster from word go! Getting two phones set up for my parents required 10+ calls to the customer service lines - and that is with trying to use the on-line set up process! It took more than a week to have the phone numbers from the previous company switch over to the Great Call phone - and that was all on Great Call; I had the transfer verification numbers from AT&T. Then, when it came through, it wiped out the already set-up on line account,and that in turn wiped out the phone directory that I had typed in (there is no way to electronically transfer from your previous phone), meaning doing it all over again.

All the customer service people that I have dealt with are perfectly nice, and most seem to want to help, but the problems are systemic. The phones themselves are not all that intuitive - but the buttons are large, clearly marked, and the type face is clear and large on the screen. It is the only reason I did not go back to AT&T or Verizon. My advice is to see if there is any way to make a phone from one of the big carriers work for you - and then DO IT. Do not use this carrier if you have any choice at all."
B01DRV2BBY,C. VanDyke,3,"I bought this Flip Phone phone through GreatCall over a year ago for my fairly deaf father who is 96.

Upsides:
1. the numbers are large.
2. The speaker is loud, when you use it instead of the handset.
3. The menu navigation is pretty straightforward for old people without a lot of confusion, but there are still seniors who will get confused using it. Answer the questions yes or no and the phone does what you want it to do. ""Do you want to call this number? >YES."" That kind of menu.

Downsides:
1. You can't block numbers on this flip phone. Old people are a big target for phone scams. My dad gets bogus telemarketing calls all the time and I can't block the numbers to prevent repeat calls. Thankfully, my next comment comes into play so he never answers the phone ...
2. Why? The ringer isn't very loud. My dad can't hear it even when it's in his pocket, and it's set as loud as it will go. On top of that, you can't set the ringer to loud AND vibrate, which would be very helpful. The ringer is either on some volume OR off with vibrate only.
3. For my father, even with hearing aids, the handset is not loud enough. Hence, we use the speaker a lot.
4. The charging dock bit the dust in less than one year."
B01DRV2BBY,M. Peterson,1,"This phone made by Alcatel is junk compared to the older Samsung flip. We upgraded when our battery went dead and were unable to replace so we thought it would be better to upgrade the phone. What a mistake. First we had all kinds of trouble because the phone would not activate even though we had to go by a window, then go to the front yard then the backyard. Hours with customer service with no help, we had to mail it in and have them activate it then send it back, more hassles and no phone. Finally we got the phone back and found that it would go dead for no reason at all. Again went through customer service, she had me take the back off and remove the battery then replace it. This is the only way we can make the phone work. If you need it in an emergency you are stuck out of luck until you remove the battery again. We were told not to do that but to return the phone for a replacement, for what another junky Alcatel. Not again. We are going to look at other carriers that have a reliable phone."
B01DRV2BBY,JJ,5,"Jitterbug Flip phone has Large Keys and SIMPLE operation. It is just great for seniors or non-techie persons. Price is most reasonable. Texting is available IF the user wants it. With Large clear menus , it's EASY to operate with YES and NO buttons! Voice dial service is free!"
B01DRV2BBY,Carmen,1,"Great Calls doesn't tell people the truth when they activate this phone. They advertise affordable monthly plans, but don't tell you that they charge you for INCOMING calls as well as OUTGOING. My 89 year old mother only has the phone for emergency calls and talking with family members. Her first bill came (on a $33 a month plan) and it was $250! They charged her for every INCOMING and OUTGOING call!!! This also means that any solicitation calls she got, Great Calls charged her for!!!!!. When I called to tried to find out why the bill was so high, they told me my mother would have to go on-line and print out her call usage and identify every phone number on there....all 276 calls!!! We cancelled the next day."
B01DRV2BBY,Zelda's stuff,1,"My 77 year old mother has this phone and has nothing but problems. The buttons on the sides of the phone are right where your hand/fingers would go to hold the phone up to your ear when talking to someone. The ringer mysteriously gets turned off all the time. The menu keys are so slow to respond it reminds me of when the internet was dial-up. It could be my mother not knowing how to use it, by both I and my sister have tried to turn on the ""jingle"" as they call the ringer, and it just goes off again. Is it my mom's thumb grasping the phone as she holds it?

I don't know, but it's no good. I do not recommend. I love the idea of the large letters but it still has too many un-needed features like background color, etc. Seniors don't want that option...do they? Time for another company to re-invent the wheel here. A wheel for seniors."
B01DRV2BBY,JRS,1,"I bought this phone a year ago directly from âJitterbugâ/GreatCall for $99 plus a $30 activation fee. My mom is in her 70s and I just needed her to have something for emergencies. The cheapest plan they have is something like $25 per month with fees but it was worth my piece of mind. She has had flip phones in the past so I figured this one would be no problem. I even programmed her friendsâ numbers into it. SHE HATED IT. I paid for the service for a year before finally giving up. She couldnât get it to turn on, it never worked right and it wouldnât hold a charge. Honestly, I heard nothing but complaints from her for the entire time she had this phone.

For Christmas I gave her my old iPhone 7 Plus. She looooves it. I honestly didnât think she could figure out a smart phone, which is why I gave her the Jitterbug Flip. What a waste of time, energy and money.

She used the Jitterbug MAYBE a total of 30 minutes for the ENTIRE YEAR!!!

The worst part of this is that when I called to cancel the service today the rep was like âToo bad your service month just renewed January 10th. I can cancel your service but youâre still paying for it through February 9thâ!!!!

WHY IS IT THAT EVERY OTHER COMPANY IN THE WORLD CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRO-RATE A CANCELLATION?!!â Good job getting an extra $20 out of me, GreatCall. Maybe youâd like to step into the 21st century with the rest of us?"
B01DRV2BBY,Frank Candlish,2,"I got a great price for the phone I bought here on Amazon..I made the choice considering the easy use of the phone and idea of a $14.99 monthly charge with no contract..Sounded great!!! But....when I got the phone and called for the activation, I learned the company adds a ""service fee"" on top of the monthly charge which came to roughly $31.40 a month. Additionally the phone has camera and texting capabilities..Great!!!! But...every time you text, it costs $0.10 for each text you send and receive. Furthermore, for every picture/selfie you take, it will also cost you an additional $0.10 for each photo..I was not pleased about the additional fees,especially the ""service fee"" which doubles the monthly basic fee. This explains the two star rating. However, I did keep the phone and activated it..These additional fees need to be considered when purchasing this phone,especially for those on a limited budget.."
B01DRV2BBY,Veg Traveler,1,I wanted to believe the good reviews because my mom wouldn't stop bugging me to purchase this red flip phone for her. She has bad eyesight and like many older seniors needs to have a cell phone that will work without all the fuss of the internet on the phone. My sister broke down and got it for her and it has been a head ache for the last 6 months. Just imagine that you don't live near the person who needs it and the phone stops working. Then you spend HOURS contacting every neighbor of hers and then more time contacting the seller to send a new chip. Many times it would just ring and she wouldn't hear it. Long story short - Before this red phone I had a walmart smartphone set up with a software that always showed big easy buttons. Then I used bluetooth to transfer her existing contacts. On this red phone all the contacts and numbers will need to be entered manually. The marketing for this phone is great because everyone who hasn't had one thinks it is a great idea. I thought it was. Currently she has no cell and waiting again for a new chip. I'm across the country so not sure if it is a signal related issue or just that the phone breaks easy. I just want to save someone else this headache and worry. Read all the negative reviews before you buy this.
B01DRV2BBY,K. Newland,2,"Back to the drawing board!

I purchased this phone for my friend who has limited vision due to macular degeneration. Activation Fee was High: $37+ . This is Day#1 with the phone, and it seems like it won't work out.

1. Poor Audio: Although we set up Voice Dial to automatically activate upon opening the phone, the automated attendant voice that says, ""Say the name"" is very tinny and difficult to understand"". The phone seems to vibrate with a weird buzzing sound when I press the keys on the keypad to enter New Contacts. This leads me to believe that Audio is going to be a problem.

2. Entering Contacts: Contacts will not let you enter duplicate phone numbers with different descriptions: I wanted to add both the doctor's name themselves and the name of the doctor's office in the event that my friend ""said the name"" in either form. Also, there is a limited amount of characters that you can use for contacts. For example, Livingston Catholic Charities was too many characters for the phone, and we could not enter it into Contacts. I wanted to enter a Contact called ""Call 911"", but it stated Invalid Number, and would not let me put it in.

3. Phone is Slippery Material & Easy to Drop: A rubberized coating and a more ""bean"", hand-shape would be easier to hold and less likely to be dropped. They don't offer any sort of protective case.

4. Voice Dialing: You can't turn the phone off without calling Customer Service to reset the automatic Voice Dial feature. Also, twice in the first two days of use, this phone has said, ""Say the Name""; however, the beep is missing. So, I have to shut the phone off and reboot it. It was a risk that the Voice Dial wouldn't come back automatically, but it did. I don't like that you have to wait for a Beep before saying a Contact name. The Senior user either ""jumps the gun"" and starts to say her contact name too early or waits a few seconds too long and the phone doesn't recognize anything. It just sits there dormant. You have to close the phone and re-open it to activate the Voice Dial again. I also don't like that you can't simply tell the phone a phone number to call. For example, say you have to call somebody not on your Contact List. For a blind person, this is a fault in the Voice Dial feature. You need to be able to say, ""000-000-0000"". The system should call whatever number is spoken.

5. Quality of keys: Should be separate, rubberized / textured keys for visually impaired users. The keys remind me of the plastic used on microwave oven keypads. It doesn't seem very durable over time. Plus, they are not responsive. They don't spring back when you depress them. This blind user had difficulty telling which key she is using and if it has actually been depressed because she can't see the screen."
B01DRV2BBY,Kat,1,"DOESN'T WORK ON ANY NETWORK OTHER THAN JITTERBUG. they won't unlock phone to use on ANY other network.

It does NOT say that clearly. If your an AT&T, or other network customer just DO NOT BUY!!!

A definite abuse of SENIORS."
B01DRV2BBY,Karen Taber,1,"Do not buy the Alcatel Red Flip Phone. My mother has dementia and is 89 years old. She has been a GreatCall customer for 4 years. She recently upgraded to new flip phone and the time continues to change through out the day. Sometimes it is correct and sometimes it is an hour off. Imagine how difficult this is for a person with dementia. No wonder why she keeps telling me the time recently changed and changes all the clocks in her home. Upon calling customer service for my mom, I am told that it is an isolated problem identified over a year ago with no solution. They would not send out a new phone to see if the problem would be rectified with new hardware. Not a phone for seniors or ANYONE for that matter. Customer service told me that having the wrong time on the phone was not a cause for sending out a new phone. Well for a senior, which is the GreatCall customer segment they are marketing to, having the wrong time is not acceptable."
B01DRV2BBY,MoonOverGeorgia,3,"I owned one of the first Original Jitterbug phones at a time when I was not considered Senior. I liked the look of the Original Jitterbug, the relatively cheap plans and the large dial pad. At the time I needed a cell phone when traveling a long commute to and from work. I had a landline at home and didn't want to give that up. I've since upgraded to a different cell phone and service because my kids are grown and I have grandchildren now and needed more talk time. Jitterbug/GreatCall has changed a lot since then and I wanted to find out if I would like their service now better than my current service. I am very close to being considered a Senior now but there are still problems with Jitterbug/Great Call that I don't like.

First the coverage map shows that I am in the Verizon network-I did check before ordering. I was also in the Verizon network 6 years ago with my first Jitterbug. The Original Jitterbug didn't work very well at my previous address. This Jitterbug doesn't work at all at my current address. So if cell phones don't work at your home or you have spotty coverage at your home, this phone is not likely to work for you and that means the 5Star Urgent Response Emergency Service will not work either. I have medical conditions that will eventually leave me unable to live alone. I had hoped the 5Star would work so that I would feel more confident as I age.

Setup-I opted to go to GreatCall's website to activate the phone. If I can do it myself I will, but that's just me. After activating and following instructions I turned the phone on to allow it to program and update. After beginning the process I received an error code with the message to call customer service. Still not wanting to deal with customer service (I'm like that) I turned the phone off, back on and it again began programming and gave me a different error code and again the message to call customer service. I restarted one additional time and the phone programmed completely. So if you're a do it yourself person and this happens to you keep turning the phone off and on-maybe this will work for you too.

The thing I hate about this phone is the VERY SHORT battery life. I've conducted the same test several times. I put the phone on the charger when I come home. By the time I'm ready to retire it's fully charged and I put it in my purse (so I won't forget it-that age thing) and when I get up the following morning I've lost 25% of the battery with absolutely no use. I carry the phone with me to the office, did not use it at all, and when I come home in the evening the battery life is down to less than 50%. If I fail to put it on the charger that night, it's dead before noon of the second day. My current cell phone will stay charged up for 5 days with little to no use.

Bluetooth-This phone is blue-tooth enabled. My vehicle is blue-tooth enabled and I had this phone connected in a matter of minutes.
The camera works as well as any cell phone I've owned and used, honestly no better/no worse.
When I have service the call is clear without any background noise. So far I've had no dropped calls when I'm in a service area.

I likely will stick with my current cell phone and not continue service with GreatCall. I really wanted this phone for the 5Star helpline and it doesn't work where I need it.

My Mom and Dad have a Jitterbug and they love it. It also works at their home. I include that to tell you It's a great phone for Seniors and people with serious health problems if you have service where you need it. I guess what I'm trying to say is the phone didn't work for me. It may work for you or your circumstances and the only way to find out is to try it. For me it's not a good fit."
B01DRV2BBY,Zen,4,"This Jitterbug phone does remind me of a Motorola Razr phone from 10 years ago. It's a flip phone that has extra large buttons and a simplified system so itâs easier for people who have never used a smartphone. I have a 90+ year old aunt who uses a hearing aid, and has poor vision in only one eye, and so she needs a phone that is really loud so she can use it even if she is not using her hearing aid as she doesnât like to use it.

This jitterbug is made by Alcatel and has some good features, but some negatives:
- Large buttons that she can see, and large on-screen fonts that she can read
- Simpler navigation with Yes/No buttons rather than symbols. However, she still presses the wrong buttons sometimes. If âYesâ was colored green and âNoâ colored red, it may make it simpler for someone with poorer vision.
- The Speaker and On/Off power button are also a bit confusing. These could be symbols I think.
- If the phone is not held up properly, the sound can be muddled and distant sounding. This is a bit of challenge with an older relative.
- The ringtones can be set up to ring differently for people so she knows who is calling without having to look. However, the ringer can be a little too quiet for my aunt sometimes, who does not hear it. I wish there was an extra loud feature.
- The phone plan can ONLY be purchased from GreatCall, they have many plans available from $14.99 that are no-contract. It piggy backs on the Verizon network, and has pretty good coverage everywhere.
- It comes with a 5 Star urgent response button for emergency, recent news suggests that the operators can also call a Lyft ride for the seniors.
- It can also take pictures as it has a camera, but this feature is not used by my aunt.
- Itâs got a location GPS function, but as another reviewer points out, it does NOT update automatically after 20 minutes, and the update can take 1- 5 minutes, or may get stuck, which can be terrible in an emergency. So itâs a feature, but not very reliable.
- The screen brightness cannot be changed, itâs bright enough but there is no way to change it. There is also no way to tell the battery power without going into Phone Info. I wish it glowed a different color if battery was low. That would provide a better visual cue to a senior.
- There is also no voice dial. For someone with vision disability that would have been a great feature.
- My world does not allow browsing or email but does give weather at the current location.
- There is also a reading magnifier which works with the LED light to magnify and light up menus in restaurants, or read finer print more easily.
- It comes with a wall charger, a docking stand, a USB cable for connecting to computer.
- This phone will also work during international travel, itâs a CDMA phone so it will work with the Verizon partners internationally
- There are some add on services available like Urgent Care (24/7 access to registered nurses and doctors), MedCoach (reminders to pick up prescriptions and take medication), and Check-in Call (an automated phone call up to six times a day to check up on the senior). Each of these services costs extra though, and can add up.

From other reviews I can see that the customer service from Great Call is variable, so far I havenât called them myself. It seems that they try to fix the problem but if this phone is to be given to a much older person someone else will have to call to have problems fixed. Also donât buy this phone to use with another provider as itâs locked to Great Call. It cannot be used with Verizon directly from what Iâve learned. So overall a good and simple phone for seniors, but not perfect."
B01DRV2BBY,Clark Isaacs,5,"One of the things that I have always hated about new cell phones is that the keys require you to be with perfect vision, nimble fingers, and a sense that really small letters are the things you should see. Well...this phone dispels all of those myths! You do not need perfect vision...it is lit up so that the keys stand out, the letters are large and back lit, and in case you do not remember the way to access the phone book you can talk to it!

Yes, this phone has all the bells and whistles! A single button in red can dispatch a call for emergency help and if you feel that you are in a quandary about whether you might make a mistake with it while you are on a call, you can turn it off for a spell while you chat with your friends.

The website which connects to the phone and you is very versatile so you can enter your phone numbers easily using your computer rather than having to use two thumbs or fingers. Type as you normally do and all gets entered in the website and your phone at the same time.

There are several ways to charge your phone and keep it operating well. One is plugging into the wall, another is connecting to your lap top or desk top computers. When I found that keeping the phone handy so that I could us the USB connection, well I was really impressed.

Some of the things which you can do with the phone are fully discussed in the well written guide book which, incidentally is in larger than normal type! Yes, you can use it without getting the magnifier out which incidentally is in the phone with a 1 to 5 magnification setting.

You can set up some text messages which will be sent if you so desire using the same words and this can be done on the website.

There is a very bright light which operates when you open the phone and press the button. There is a warning in the manual, pay heed to it. Do not stare into the light when you turn it on, it is VERY bright!

The camera takes decent pictures, but is not the same as some of the high quality you will find in a camera or other type of phone. One thing which I would have done is set it up so that you could shoot a short movie like 30 seconds to capture a memorable moment. You also can upload to your Facebook page the photos you take.

This is a small, compact, and easily handled phone with a speaker ability which is easily accessed by the touch of a button you can very easily see.

The monthly service charge is reasonable if you want to use this phone for only emergencies or speaking on occasion. If you decide to use the health lines the cost is .99 per call. You might want to use this Ala Carte menu unless you feel you need to be in the loop many times per month. There are two other health related calls you can make as well for advice on medical care."
B01DRV2BBY,AeroJim,4,"The Jitterbug Flip is an effective and easy to use phone for use with the 5Star Urgent Response service. This is the primary factor for having this phone in my home. For a person with dementia most phones are too difficult to use for emergency contacts. The single button contact with this phone makes it ideal for this purpose. The 5Star agents are courteous and efficient.

If the Jitterbug Flip could incorporate single button dialing for calling ""favorites"" this would improve its usability for use by persons with dementia or limitations in manual dexterity.

The phone appears to be constructed in a very sturdy format and should stand up to daily use, including being dropped, as is often the case with senior citizens.

If ones primary use for this phone is to serve as a regular cell phone, there are limitations. The lack of ""voice to text"" capability significantly limits its use for text messaging. The camera function is also limited and does not permit picture editing, etc. without downloading the photo to a computer."
B01DRV2BBY,waltybird,2,"Was given to a senior relative. She likes it because she can make a call by just pushing a programmed button and she does not need to remember how to get an outside line from her facility. Down side is that she cannot easily call people that are not programmed into her phone without us giving her direction over the Jitterbug so she can dial her land line. The REAL downside is the horrendous sound quality. It is nearly impossible to understand her when she speaks on this phone. If we get a call or message we cannot understand, we know it's her and we just call her back on her landline, where she is very easy to understand. For the price of the phone, and the price of the service I'd have expected better quality. I honestly think this company just scams seniors with their phones and service. We'd love to get her on a better plan with a better phone but because she is used to this phone she refuses to change."
B01DRV2BBY,K. L.,2,"Mom got this to replace the medical alert system I had bought her as she didn't care for wearing the pendant. It arrived late. Now she did buy this from the company directly not through Amazon. The phone went on sale the next day, and the company rep never mentioned that. BUT they did credit her the difference. Problem was, they credited it for a period BEFORE she owned the phone. Another shining example of customer service. They finally straightened that out, but it makes you wonder how relaible the 5 star might be if the rest of the service is this messed up.

Pros: Big keys and easy to see. One button dialing for help. Dial tone just by flipping open the phone.

Cons: Customer service needs way more training. A $45 activation fee. In this age when almost all cell phone companies don't do this anymore. Get charged for an incoming call, even from Great Call. Hardly anyone does that either anymore. Decide you don't like it and return it, forfeit the activation fee AND pay $10 for restocking. A load of garbage there."
B01DRV2BBY,KS,1,"Pros: Bigger than previous version, 5-Star button has been moved to bottom so you don't easily hit it when you don't mean to. So, some small pluses over previous Jitterbug Flips.
BUT---
Cons: IT DOESN'T ALWAYS RING FOR INCOMING CALLS. This is a big one for me. I've missed two important medical calls in the last week. Was sitting right by the phone waiting for the calls both times, but the phone went straight to ""Missed Call"" notice without ringing.
Also--hard to open, hard to hold during a call so that you aren't constantly touching the buttons that turn volume up or down. Obnoxiously loud dial tone.

UPDATE. A very nice CSR from GreatCall reprogramed my phone, so we hope it will now ring when it's supposed to. Only thing is, now the phone doesn't have a dial tone at all. Hey, ho.
SECOND UPDATE: A week later, it's back to not ringing consistently."

B01DRV2BBY,LeeZarr,4,"I really like the phone. HOWEVER, I have been constant harassed by IRS scammers and robo calls!!!!!! I am on the do not call list. BUT SINCE we can NOT BLOCK calls this is VERY annoying!!!!!! I get calls in the middle of the night and early am....I filled FCC consumer complaint but these (*(*&* scammers just get different phone numbers, The phone service provider Verizon does NOTHING to stop this...Do these robo scammers calls earn a lot of money for the major phone companies, and that is why nothing gets done to protect the consumer?

Love the phone hate the scammers calling on my phone and eating my minutes"
B01DRV2BBY,Dave G,2,"Pros:
Clear display, bright flashlight

Cons:
Flimsy charging base that tips over easily
Phone can be set to Ring or Vibrate, but not both
No real battery gauge, just a display that will come up when it needs charging
Phone book (contacts) cannot be sorted; it is always in the order that you entered your contacts
Phone book only holds names and phone numbers, no other information
No real keyboard for text messages, you must hit number keys multiple times to enter letters
Photos cannot be sorted; they are always in the order taken

Good things about 5Star Service:
Urgent Care; access to nurses and doctors
MedCoach as a reminder to take medicines
Check in call that notifies family/friend if there is a problem"
B01DRV2BBY,Blank,1,"Just tried to set this up for my grandmother, what a nightmare. Website consistently had errors, I had to input the same information over and over again while site tried to figure out what it was doing. The order never confirmed the phone plan, cost, taxes or fees. Ultimately an hour in, and the phone its self won't connect(error 09) to the network and suggests I call customer service. So much for and easy to use device."
B01DRV2BBY,DAVID M.,5,"The Jitterbug Flip is the answer for those not too tech savy. Its easy to follow instructions get you started in just a few minutes. Extra large keyboard makes it wonderful for the sight challenged. The Five Star feature is excellent . When I tested it , I was talking with a response operator within 15 seconds! The phone itself is pretty much automatically operating, just open it up and you are ready to either dial your number or you can tell the phone who you want to call using the voice call. The phone comes complete with an easy to use charging stand and the battery seems to last for several days on a single charge. If you are looking for a phone for a loved one who needs special care and ease of operation , I would highly recommend this phone!"
B01DRV2BBY,Pepper,3,"I bought this from the seller, GreatCall. I just wanted a backup because my smartphone stopped working once.
EVery week I have to contact customer service: phone wont turn on or wont accept charge. First time I called was because I could not get a signal. Tech told me to stand near a window. What kind of help is that?
I faithfully charge it every day.
Tonight phone is stuck at 6:52 pm while the real time now is midnight. Customer service wont be available until morning.Phone wont turn off or on and I cant figure out how to open battery case to reset.
The best thing about this phone, a Jitterbug, is the 5 star emergency service.That is an unexpected bonus. At least that part is working even if the rest is not.So maybe I will get another flip phone from a different provider and get emergency medical service from somebody else too."
B01DRV2BBY,anillini71,2,"Not-so smart Jitterbug Operatorâs Manual

When selecting a cell phone it would have helped me if someone had written an Operatorâs Manual for the Jitterbug Alcatel OneTouch. So I will do that for you.

Setting the phone up is easy if you buy it from Great Call. Simply turn it on. The rest is automatic.

If you want to put names and phone numbers into your âPhone Bookâ the easiest way is to log in to your Great Call account. Not only can you use your regular keyboard, but you can alphabetize.

Now, to use your phone, flip it open, press the âOnâ button, and hold it for the count of five. If you donât hold that button, youâll be disappointed to find your phone off when you want to use it.

After the count of five there will be a row of lights across the bottom of the display that run, and run, and run â Iâd guess for at least a minute. If you close your phone before those lights stop running you may find that your phone is not on when you want to use it.

Now, when you want to use it, flip it open. If it does not light up, donât press the On/Off button again to turn it on, because you will turn it Off.

After you open it, press a button and wait. If it eventually lights up that means that it is on, and ready to use. If it does not light up, itâs still off, in spite of your best previous efforts to turn it on.

Now, letâs say someone calls you. You look at the outside window to see who is calling, and donât see anything. So you open it to see who it is, and discover that you have taken the call, whether you wanted to or not.

Now letâs say that it is someone you want to talk to, so you say âHello.â âHello.â âHello.â This time you need to press a button to answer your phone.

So now you get a call that you want to take, so you open your phone, and not knowing if you need to press a button to receive the call you ask, âAre you there?â The caller answers, âOf course Iâm here. Why else would I be calling you?â

Want to know if your phone needs charging? There is no indicator on the screen. Flip your phone open, coax it to light up, press the down arrow eight times (it wonât scroll if you hold the down arrow down), then press âYesâ for Phone Info. If you forget to do this regularly youâll find that you canât use your phone when you need it.

Now, if you want to call someone in your Phone Book, whoâs last name starts with Z, and you have alphabetized by last name, go to your Phone Book, and press the down arrow. Then press it again. And then again. And again. And again, again, again. You need to move through your entire phone book, one name at a time, to get to the Zâs. Did you buy a smart phone? Then you canât expect to just hold the down arrow down and expect it to keep scrolling through unwanted names until it gets to the name you want.

7-20-18 I finally gave up on the Jitterbug and bought a smart phone. I cancelled GreatCall service on June 28. I received a bill dated June 26. Great Call charged me for 28 days that I did not use their service. Had I been aware that the previous month's service ended on June 26 I could have cancelled two days earlier. So be cautious about giving Great Call your credit card number."
B01DRV2BBY,Connie Arnold,5,"I find the Jitterbug Flip phone to be very easy to use, even when you are not proficient with technology. It has large yes and no buttons and arrows up and down for the different functions. It also has large buttons and display, is bright and clear to see everything and has volume controls for those who have difficulty hearing. I have never completely understood how to do everything on a cell phone until I started using the Jitterbug. Now I can do everything from making calls, sending texts, taking and sending photos, checking messages and more. It also is a safety device with a button to push in case of emergency to be instantly connected to a professional who can help you. I like the additional features of flashlight and magnifier. I highly recommend it, especially for seniors like myself who have trouble seeing or hearing well and are easily confused."
B01DRV2BBY,Joe Marlow,5,"I had a smart phone, most of which I had no idea how to use, being born prior to the technology era. I had to charge it all of the time. My apps were using power when I didn't even use them. Now, I have a Jitterbug Flip. It's easy for my arthritic hands to hold. The buttons are large and well lit. It has an easy to use menu. I can send pictures in minutes or save them for later. The phone book puts my friends, family and emergency numbers at my fingertips. With 5 star, emergency help is just a push of a button away. If you're a senior citizen, it is the easiest, most convenient communication device you can own."
B01DRV2BBY,LILLIAN RESTAINO BAUMANN,5,"Jitterbug Flip was recommended to me ...I ordered it and the surprises began...first, the customer service rep was knowledgeable, courteous and efficient....Apparently, the features were all activated for me...friends immediately sent me photos..and lo and behold!... there they were!!!...another friend informed me that she texted me...and it just magically appeared!!! Then...I took my own photos with the very easy to use camera and sent them out...miracles of miracles!!!
""Easy to use"" does not begin to describe my introduction to the Flip...it holds your hand and walks you through all the features...
As a matter of fact, at 87, the Flip has given me so much confidence and joy...I am seriously contemplating moving up to a Jitterbug Smartphone in the foreseeable future!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara Bodzin,3,"I really liked the large buttons. They were easy to use despite having arthritic and tremulous hands. The 5 Star button was a nice feature, but unnessary if one has an emergency alert system. Mine is free with my home alarm system, and I never leave home alone. I did not like it for calls. II entered a number and instructed the phone to call. I got a message that it was dialing then nothing. The recipients never got the call. ""Of all of the calls that I attempted, only one went through. I also found that I kept hitting the volume button when holding the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,BBA,4,"If you are looking for an easy to use flip phone, this is a perfect choice. The Jitterbug Flip has many of the features of more expensive phones, but at a lower cost. Most of the phone's functions are done by simply using the YES and NO buttons.

You will find a phone book, camera, photo storage, text capabilities, voice mail, and even an object magnifier at your fingertips when you open the phone. All are easy to find and use.

The camera is easy to use...the photos are adequate but not great.You also have the ability to share your photos on Facebook. You can download photos to your computer by using a cord. You cannot, however, send photos to an email address...only to the phone number of a contact.

I found the phone to be large and a bit heavy for my hand, but otherwise more than adequate based on how easy it was to use and its cost."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"After receiving my Jitterbug Flip, I was very impressed with the appearance and features of the phone. First of all, it is a flip phone with features that I would never have imagined on a flip phone.
The color is crisp and shiny, the screen is bigger (one of my favorite features), the buttons are bigger, which makes them easy to see, and the volume and speaker phone is louder(which is great for Seniors). Not until I received my Jitterbug Flip did I realize there were so many differences in flip phones. This one is amazing!
All the amenities such as the 5Star service, which connects me to a highly trained agent to help with emergencies, Urgent Care which gives me unlimited access to RN's and Doctors 24-7, and prescription refill reminders, for me makes this the best flip phone I ever had!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Michelle Alberigi McKenzie,5,"I got this for my husband who refuses to use a cell phone. He didn't like the little throw-away phones because the buttons are too small and they're just too hard to read. Basically, they weren't intuitive enough for him.

The Jitterbug Flip was easy to set up. My husband likes the large display (he has eye disease) and the large number pad. He also likes that he can leave it on and just drop it into the charging dock, which is a sturdy and steady station that doesn't tip over (What a concept!). Then drop into his pocket when he leaves the house. Drop back into the charger. Easy peasy. The emergency button is a terrific feature too! The camera allows for some basic shots. While not for making art-pics, it will certainly would be handy if a quick photo is needed. The sound/voice is good on the phone too!

I'll update this as we continue to use this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Fan Buyer,3,"First, let's start with the pluses. The screen has a clear boldface font that is easy to read. The volume is good. Even though it does not have computer access, it can transfer photos to a computer. The keys are large enough to be easy to tap without overlapping into the next key and mistyping. Dialing by voice is helpful. Because it is a flip, no chance of a butt dial. Some (especially the children of older seniors) will love the 5-star option for emergencies and other services.

Now for the negatives. The screen is still tiny, only about 1""x2"" for the text in a text message. And this is in a phone that is just barely lighter than my existing phone, which is closer to 2""x3"" for texts. I love the idea of the magnifier but found it difficult to position so I could read what I thought I had it aimed at. The keys have multiple characters per key so it is onerous to type anything and it cannot send texts by voice. Some might like the simple scroll down menus for options but I have grown accustomed to a touch screen with icons and prefer that; however, if I channel and older friend who never really got the hang of her phone, I expect she would have found scrolling easier. Photos appear rather grainy.

Coverage has been a mixed bag. A call to someone whose voice has a tendency to cut off while using my existing phone was quite clear on the Jitterbug. She, on the other hand, said she could hear my ok said my voice sounded ""mushy."" Also, a voicemail I left myself was not at all good quality. Other calls have generally been ok on both sides. The phone itself described as anywhere from ""fair"" to ""strong"" the reception for the areas from which I typically call.

As to improvements, number one would be the ability to text by voice. Second would be an actual full keypad. (If there were voice texting, that would not be as important.) Some of these issues do appear to be resolved by Jitterbug's higher-end phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Vivian Vukojevich,5,"I purchased my Jitterbug Flip phone about a month ago. I am happy with it because it is simple and easy to use. There are a limited number of buttons to choose from, which makes it very easy. The numbers on the number pad are large and backlit, so are very easy to see. I don't consider myself very old--I'm 73--or handicapped; I know computers, and have always considered myself an intelligent person. However, on two occasions I was given a ""free"" smartphone, and I found it confusing, frustrating, and very hard to use. I didn't want the long list of ""apps"" on the phone; I only wanted to be able to make or receive calls. I don't like a phone that has a ""mind of its own"" and does things I don't want it to do. For example, ""Ask Google"" kept coming up on the screen whenever I tried to make a call, even though I didn't want it to.
I am paying $31 a month for the service, including voicemail and up to 300 text messages. I was able to cancel my landline phone; I didn't like the taxes and fees I had to pay for the landline service.
I don't have the 5star emergency service, as it costs about an extra $9.99 a month, and I don't think that I need it--maybe I might in the future. It is easy to re-charge. One small drawback is that when I use the ""phonebook,"" I have to keep pressing the down arrow until I get to the phone number that I want; this is slightly inconvenient. It takes a little time to do text messages, but it's worth it sometimes, when you don't want to actually make a call but just want to send a brief message."
B01DRV2BBY,Shanshan,1,"Since you HAVE TO go work GreatCall, so yes my activation experience is relevant. Calling GreatCall to order the red Jitterbug flip was a good experience, although on top of $60 they charged me $35 activation and $10 shipping, and refuse to waive those, but threw in a leather pouch as goodwill...

The real nightmare cane when the phone arrived and we try to port in a Verizon prepaid number. So GreatCall submit the port request and tell you it might take up 3 days to convert. This phone is for out of town elderly relative I can't stay there keep testing for him for , so I waited an hour and called GreatCall, only to find port request was rejected (Verizon account number didn't match). If the port request is rejected right away, LET ME KNOW RIGHT AWAY INSTEAD OF MAKING US WAIT FOOLISHLY FOR 3 DAYS FOR NOTHING! It took a week and many phone calls to finally port in the Verizon number, and some reps were very helpful and some just want to brush you off.

The phone being easy to use does have drawback. The Bluetooth would not pair to any of my phones or PC to let me transfer phone book or photos. Do the final solution was to text the photos to the phone, and login online to enter the phone book (and then the contacts automatically pops up on the phone. The phone works fine, but interface is very limited so not much you can tweak or personalize. Oh well the user asked for a simple phone, so you get a simple phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Oldsparkey,5,"I wanted a cell phone to replace the one I had that you purchase cards for. I wanted a plain phone with a emergency contact button. Being a heart patient with a defibrillator and pacer the 5 star ( emergency ) button was very appealing. The voice mail , camera , light and large numbers is also nice plus the low monthly rate.
All in all the Jitterbug is a nice package for a person who wants security and some extras without all of the rest bells and whistles. Personally I can not see where a person could go wrong with the Jitterbug , I really like mine. . ."
B01DRV2BBY,Medianvalued,4,"This is exactly the kind of phone you get for relatives who are getting just a little too old. They have trouble seeing numbers and their fingers aren't so good at pressing tiny buttons. What they need is an easy to use cell phone and forget about all the other stuff like internet access. Actually this is also the kind of phone that I could live with too - 99% of the time I do not use smartphone features (in part because I am scared of triggering high data charges and in part because I am rarely far away from my laptop). We have purchased similar phones before for my mother in law and basically there was not much chance she could do much more than use speed dial of preentered numbers. This phone delivers nicely as a basic easy to read phone with big keys. This version is tied to Verizon's network and Verizon's charges are IMHO maybe 50% higher than the $10/month spot where I think basic voice phones should be priced. You do get a camera, a charger, Bluetooth and a USB cable."
B01DRV2BBY,Aine O'brocken,4,"Phone is quite usable. It seems to be louder than other phones, which I appreciate. On/off is simple--just push the button. I very much like the fact that it includes a medical alert button, although I have not yet had occasion to use said button. I also like the additional services offered--for example, check-in calls daily or several times a day if I want them. The phone is of a size to slip conveniently into my pocket, so I have the medical alert when I am out and about.

A couple of things kind of bug me. One is the fact that the phone periodically resets the time an hour early--which is a bit of a nuisance. Customer service tells me that GreatCall is working on that problem, but for now, if I turn the phone off and then on again, that should solve the problem. It does that.

And when I want to send a text, the phone offers me a choice of a ""library"" of prepared texts and a second selection where I can customize the text. Since I seldom, if ever would want to use the ""library"" of texts, it is rather a nuisance to have to switch to ""customize"" before I can send the text I want. I would prefer that the ""customize"" option were offered first."
B01DRV2BBY,T. Woodcock,5,I purchased this phone for my 88 year old mother who is still mobile and independent to an extent. She has some memory issues and learning to use the phone was a challenge but it is getting easier. I love the 5star button. I love the fact that I can use the app and keep track of her. She only goes a few places a week but it's nice to know when she gets home safely. Setting up the phone and adding contacts and personal information is easy. Customer service is usually very busy but both times I have called I have been treated very nice and not hurried. I actually spoke to a person that I could understand as well which was a welcome change! Both times my questions were answered and both reps went above and beyond to explain some things to me that I was unaware of. The app was a little challenging to set up. It took a while to get it connected but I am so thankful for it because I don't have to call her every few minutes to see if she is at home. Overall we are very pleased. My mother loves the red phone because it is easy for her to locate. She loves the big buttons and the screen showing larger numbers. The best thing is she can hear on it! The speaker is loud enough that she can hear really well.
B01DRV2BBY,Lucky Clucker,3,"This review should be for two separate things: the phone and the service.

The phone is great, big buttons and very loud. I ordered it so my dad would actually hear his incoming calls. We tried to activate the service several times and were never able to get the phone to work. My dad already used Verizon so it wasn't that the service wasn't available, it just kept saying the service had already been activated by somebody else (not us).

The point of this phone was that a non-internet savvy person should have been able to use it. This definitely isn't the case. He wasn't interested in the trouble he faced in activating this phone and just bought another 30-day card for his old phone.

Good phone, bewildering activation."
B01DRV2BBY,Dan Z,1,"My old flip phone from Greatcall worked fine. When I held the ON button down, I had dial tone in about 4 seconds. Then they offered an update to an ""improved"" version of the phone. I bought it. This one takes between 58 to 60 seconds (I timed it several times) to get a dial tone after the screen first lights up. Since this is supposed to be an emergency phone, and 60 seconds could be a lifetime in an emergency, this is unacceptable. Customer service says ""it is supposed to be that way,"" and then ""we no longer support your old phone"" when I said I wanted to go back to it. Really? Would the older phone have suddenly stopped working because I hadn't bought the newer one?

One of the improvements is supposed to be voice dialing (select a name by voice), and is described in the manual. The phone didn't have it. Customer service told me that It had to be turned on by them, and they would do so. That was several days ago....

Update 10/11/18. Well, there is still no voice dialing. This is not the first time a GreatCall representative has lied to me.

Another annoyance: This no version has almost NO configurable settings. For example, pressing keys to enter a phone number causes a very loud beep with each press. There is no way to turn off or reduce volume for this."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"I have been using cell phones since the late 1980's and this is absolutely the worst one I have ever owned. The earlier flip phone model that Great Call offered was really nice but they stopped carrying it and replaced it with this piece of garbage. I had to send the first one back and the second one works slightly better but not much. You flip it open and sometimes the screen lights up and sometimes it doesn't for quite awhile. You press a key and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Pretty much the same with every feature on the phone. If there was a ""minus"" Star in the rating I would have used it."
B01DRV2BBY,Eric B. Borgman,5,"This Jitterbug Flip phone by GreatCall, was tested by both myself and my mother. My mother is elderly and not a technical person. She could never use one of those phones that you have to use your finger on, however, after not too much time, she was capable in using this phone. I like the design of it, the buttons are big and the numbers typed in are displayed big. It has a good speaker on it too, so people who may be slightly deaf, should still be able to use this phone effectively.

The interface is simple too. Basically, ""yes"" and ""no"" responses are used. When you press a button it asks if you want that feature and you answer ""yes"" or ""no."" Then of course there is the main event, the 5Star Urgent response button, which immediately connects to a, ""trained Urgent response agent who can help in any situation and emergency.""

One thing that threw me off a bit was when I dialed 411 for information, expecting a regular telephone operator and was connected to a Jitterbug operator, who gave me the number I needed. So I like this phone. I personally like the flip phone design better than the flat screen design anyway, but I could see that my mother also responded well with the phone and used it correctly.

This Jitterbug phone could be very useful in an emergency, even more so than flat screen versions. My neighbor who is in her eighties had a similar flat screened phone, and she couldn't figure it out. So I recommend this Jitterbug flip phone to people who are not technically savvy, but might need it."
B01DRV2BBY,RisSaSue,5,Just activated this phone today for my grandmother. So too soon to rate battery life or durability of phone. But so far we are happy with the size and the functionality. My grandmothers old phone was the LG Revere 3 and it just wasn't big enough for her. She found in difficult to dial. You can see the comparison in the photos. The bit bigger numbers make it alot easier. I am impressed that the jitterbug has a dial tone before you dial. The activation was easy enough online through greatcall.com there was a $25 activation fee and $4 activation fee I believe for the free car charger they are mailing us. The 200 minute plan is $14.99 before taxes and fees. Texts aren't included. We didnt add on voicemail or anything thing additional. The 5star button when pressed without the 5star service plan will still ask you on the screen if you want to dial 911. Which I think is great. All in all so far so good. Hopefully everything will be smooth sailing and the phone will keep working well. I'll update if not!
B01DRV2BBY,gardenburd,2,"This was a great phone. Not used very often, but fairly easy for my low vision, memory impaired 86 yr old mother. Now it doesn't work at all. Have had it 2 yrs, used it several times/mo and now several keys have stopped working. The ""yes"" key doesn't work at all. Also it doesn't end call when closed. The volume resets to low for no known reason. So I'm shopping for new and will not again use Jitterbug. This is the second Jitterbug phone I've had to replace.... Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."
B01DRV2BBY,S. Bernstein,5,"Although, admittedly, I don't use my Flip often (I mostly keep it in the glove box of my car for emergencies) when I do use it I'm really happy that I purchased it. Yes, I'm a senior citizen and a bit technologically challenged, but I make no apologies for loving the big buttons, large screen, and intuitive user interface. Since I don't use it often, I also love the way the battery stays charged for long periods. Thanks, Jitterbug, for coming to the rescue of those of us who just don't want or need all of the features of the over-hyped smartphones."
B01DRV2BBY,Blake Fraina,2,"This started out as a five-star review.

While Iâm no senior citizen, I feel Iâm the perfect consumer for this product. I am 54 years old and have never had a cell phone. I donât like the small buttons, complicated user instructions and all the bells-and-whistles going on with the most up-to-date phones. Personally, I have no use for the majority of the functions. I have no interest in texting, surfing the internet or taking selfies while Iâm out and about. Plus, call me old fashioned, but when I talk to someone on the phone, I prefer to have something actually in front of my mouth when Iâm speaking.

So this was just what the doctor ordered. Firstly, itâs super simple to set up. Literally, I just turned it on and the number was pre-programmed and ready to go. The keypad numbers are extra large and all the functions are pretty much 100% self-explanatory. If you want to call someone, merely punch the number buttons (which appears in large type on the screen) and when youâre done, there is a bar across the bottom of the screen that asks if you want to call and you hit âYES.â I never cracked open the user guide and was still able to record my voicemail message, access voicemail, take a couple of photos, set my ringtone and talk on the speaker with no problems.

I live in CT and took it on a long weekend to Chicago to test these various functions. I took a couple of photographs - albeit very grainy ones but hey, if you need to catch that subway perv in the act, it will certainly do the trick. I used the speaker phone on a call to my mother and all three parties on the conversation could hear one another splendidly. There are a handful of pretty standard ringtones on offer and some pre-set emergency medical numbers (although I suspect these are fee based services associated with the phone manufacturer).

So yeah, everything was going great until I got to OâHare for my return trip to CT. Turned on the phone to call my husband and - pffft â it was gone. Nothing. Nada. Completely black screen. I attempted to charge it up when I arrived home (even though I kind of knew this wasnât the problem) and still nothing.

This is a really cool functional item that was super-intuitive and easy to use. I hate to admit it, but after just a week of use, I actually missed having a phone. Perhaps I just got a lemon. I donât know. Since my experience is probably not typical, I would suggest reading other reviews and weighing everything together before you make the choice whether to buy the Jitterbug or look elsewhere."
B01DRV2BBY,Donald Carson,1,"The new Flip Phone is a step backward, the Jitterbug 5 had the perfect size and user friendly functions, dialing could be easily done with one hand AND the speaker stayed off until you told it to turn on. The Flip has the annoying feature of having the speaker on for frequently used functions, including the annoying dial tone when you open it up. Even more annoying are the ""beeps"" you get when sending text messages, there's no way of turning that off except dialing the volume all the way down, an extra unnecessary step. After that you have to remember to turn the volume back up so that you can hear calls. What you are doing can clearly be seen on the screen so why are the beeps necessary? Here's a radical idea: Engineer the phone so that you only have the speaker on when you want it on.
Fixing the beeps and dial tone issues would make the phone better, but one would still be stuck with an unnecessarily big bulky phone. My fantasy is that a Jitterbug 5 type phone would make a comeback with new features like more symbol choices such as $, &, %, "" and be able to send a text message with a phone number that you have in hand and not have to go online and enter it into your phone book list to send."
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,5,"This is a nice ""Star Trek"" (flip) phone, and I like it a lot.

First the plus side:
*I love having my phone number so prominent on the opening screen.
*The text library is INGENIOUS! Such common texts as ""Yes,"" ""No,"" ""How are you?"", etc. are saved and are easily available to pick and send--minimal fuss and bother.
*The earpiece speaker is loud, and the handset microphone is quite good. Old Dad, who is 80 and who is missing a lot of his hearing, can hear me better when I use this phone.
*The customer service at GreatCall is U.S.-based and is terrific. Second level customer service took a fair amount of time, but she was able to fix the problem right up once I got her, and she stayed on the phone with me until the Jitterbug was completely on the system.
*The keypad and the words are easily tactual--a bit sandpapery. This is NOT Braille--it is that the print can be felt. This is superb for low light or low vision.
*The call waiting, which seems to be NON-standard on this unit, is so easy--""yes"" to switch and ""no"" to end. Frankly, this is the first time I've ever been able to use that feature with a phone.
*The ""dock"" (drop-in charger) is something I've never had with a phone, and it's a GREAT idea! The phone can be plugged in as well.
*It's NOT black or charcoal gray! It's silver, and it's SO much easier to find! A bright little blinkie even comes on on the front of the unit when there's a text or a call.

On the more negative side:
*There doesn't seem to be a way to add a battery indicator to an easily visible spot, and it's a good bit of a battery pig.
*I haven't found a simple way to add callers, texters, etc. to the address book, and I've really tried. I've only been able to do it directly--write the number on paper, then add it to the address book.
*It's taken some getting used to because it's not all that intuitive, at least to me.
*I didn't care for the built-in games.

Mixed:
*The phone is fairly big (6.6 inches by 2.4 inches) and is on the heavy side at 4.64 ounces. Size is both a plus and a minus--big screen is nice sometimes, but it's pretty big in a pocket. The weight easily pulls it out of my pocket, and I think I'll start using a small camera case to hold it. It just fits in one. It does seem to be able to handle a fall, though, and mine bounces once a week or so.
*The magnifier (uses the camera to show something on the screen) isn't all that useful, if you ask me.

So...I call this one most highly recommended, IF you're looking for a simpler phone. If you want a ""smart"" one, you won't be happy at all."
B01DRV2BBY,J. Pressel,1,"Trying to look at the phone was very difficult.
The company that sells the jitterbug phone (Great call) does not let stores like best buy open the phone box so you can see the phone. We had to buy the jitterbug phone just to look at the phone. The phone did not work for my friend. The flip phone has a smooth surface that was to hard to get a grip on. She could not open the flip phone. She returned the phone that day. But what a pain for an already handicapped person!

Only GreatCall phone service works with jitterbug phones
GreatCall makes jitterbug phones and controlls the phone plans. Unlimited talk and text is $49.99 per month plus admin fees. Then add in the special services and you have a big bill!"
B01DRV2BBY,MARK E.,1,"Activation was a pain. The Great Call support person said I should be in an area where there are at least three bars or the activation would be difficult. This forced me to leave my home, get in the car and park where there was a good signal (using a different person's cell phone) just to activate this one (which took several attempts by the way).

The charging cradle was sloppy. You had to play with the phone's position and tip toe away hoping it would stay in the ""charging"" mode (very frustrating).

When you wanted to use the phone, once flipped open the display sometimes would appear, sometimes not. Usually when the display would appear, there was a delay first. When you were lucky enough to get the menu to display, there was a noticeable delay from when you pressed the up/down button to when the item on the screen would change.

Powering it off/on, removing/replacing the battery and calling Great Call were of no help. The symptoms persisted.

I can't comment on battery life or call quality since I returned it to the local pharmacy store where I bought it out of frustration.

I should've known with the poor design of the charging cradle, more frustration with the phone was inevitable.

Months later I called Great Call asking if they worked the bugs out. They admitted there were some phones out there ""with those issues"" but they have corrected the problem. As of this review (April 4, 2017) I still see negative reviews out there for the same issues I experienced several months prior. Since my Jitterbug5 died and they no longer activate those models anymore, I'll wait for the Jitterbug Flip to be discontinued and will consider its replacement.

Since there seems to be lots of people who are happy with their Jitterbug Flip, the only advice I can offer is if you get the phone and don't have these symptoms, CONGRATULATIONS! If not, make sure you return it before your return period expires because it won't get any better.

I, for one, don't have the patience to keep buying/returning it until I find a ""good one"". Great Call should've recalled those they know to be defective, or at the very least offer a decent alternative which isn't a smart phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Chelzie,5,"I bought this phone for my 85 year old grandmother, per her request. It has great features like big buttons and...A DIAL TONE! This is essential for our seasoned citizens, who are just getting used to having a little more access to technology. The interface is very easy to use overall, and you can navigate easily by using the large YES? and NO? buttons. Both times we contacted customer service, they were excellent and extremely helpful. We were even able to port her existing phone number over to the new device in about two days. She's a happy camper, and so am I!"
B01DRV2BBY,leoman,5,"I purchased this item for my self, I find that it works very well. I can call or receive calls and they are very clear. I got the flip phone as I do not need (or want) the smart phone, with all of it's features. I wanted it for basic communication, mostly on trips and do not require any of the other features on the smart phone. My phone will text, but I do not wish to ! I would recommend this phone to anyone who requires communication. This item is also available in a smart phone version, if that is what you need. I never had any trouble getting or receiving a signal and it was always crystal clear !"
B01DRV2BBY,GadgetFamily,4,"Seniors seem to fall into one of 2 categories...either they are pretty tech savvy and lean heavily on their smartphones and tablets to help them or they are extremely tech-phobic. This Jitterbug is obviously geared toward the latter group. It is cleverly designed with some features that make it easy for seniors to use for calls and a valid and surprisingly convenient ""safety"" device, too. Our experience of it is mixed as there are definite pros and cons.

Pros:
- Solid feel compared to the typical flip phones of yesteryear
- Large Font and bright, easy to read screen
- Large BACKLIT Keys on the Keypad
- Default Text Messages saved for easy sending
- Camera is decent for a flip phone!
- Red ""5"" button offers great service
- Games to stimulate brain (more available, too)

Cons
- Charging stand is AWFUL
- Yes/No commands are sometimes confusing
- Navigating the menus is not all easy or intuitive
- Volume is completely inadequate for anyone hard of hearing

Overall, it is a great simple phone for calls for seniors, especially if they do not have any hearing issues. If they do, a typical phone call may be difficult as the volume never got loud enough for the lady for whom I do caregiving. She didn't have the patience to try to stamp out text messages of her own design either, but she could use the static ones already saved in the phone. Since it is a flip phone with a standard numeric keypad, you need to press each key multiple times to get to certain letters or characters (remember when texting first came out?).

We have an 8 yr old who has medical issues and, between her tremors and lack of dexterity, she can't reliably use a touchscreen. She often has medical needs that arise when she is in bed and we thought we would give her this phone to try instead of having to communicate via the baby monitor (she shares a room and doesn't want to wake her sisters). She was able to easily update us on her needs through the old-school text method on the Jitterbug and she really grew to love it!

The menu system on the phone leaves much to be desired and, while it may have been clever to label the Send/End buttons as ""Yes"" and ""No,"" the prompt questions don't always fit those responses, which created a lot of confusion for the lady I take care of. She has all of her faculties, but found the Jitterbug rather confusing, except for making or receiving calls and sending the stored messages. Our daughter, though, has less fear about pushing the wrong buttons, (a benefit of being 8) and although she thought the prompts were confusing, she didn't mind the trial and error method. The elderly lady, however (like many older people who are technophobes) was afraid she would destroy the phone with the press of a wrong button, so it was more challenging for her. She did really like the larger buttons and the crisp, easy to read numbers on the screen, though!

The 5 star button (center bottom of the phone) is a really cool feature, though everyone here agreed that it should say something else on it...because 5* doesn't mean anything to anyone except Great Call. It should say HELP or something like that, especially if a senior has any memory issues...they wouldn't know what the heck ""5*"" means. The 5 star service itself is awesome, though! If a senior falls or has a medical crisis and presses that button, they are instantly connected to the service team. Our experience with them was fantastic! They operate as a triage team of sorts. They can dispatch medical or police as needed, or simply notify a couple of pre-determined individuals on a contact list about whatever the situation may be. It can even be used to see if symptoms warrant immediate attention or not. For us, we could have our daughter keep this at school with her in case she has a seizure between classes or in the restroom and needs help. We could set it up so they could notify her school office and me, for example when she presses that button. If you press the 5* button and don't answer, they call the phone and you can leave specific directives with the team as to what to do if they don't get an answer. This customizable help feature is definitely the SHOW-stealer of this phone and is critical for vulnerable people, whether they live alone or not!

The serious downfall of this phone is the charging base. At first, we thought it was wonderful...you set the phone in it and it starts charging...which is what a senior citizen or someone with compromised dexterity (like our daughter) would need. Unfortunately, however, we found that MANY times, it actually wasn't charging! It would say it was...and we would go back a couple of hours later to get it and the battery would be completely dead. Soon we realized that it takes a delicate balancing act to get the phone to actually take a charge. The charging station has 2 little prongs in it (see the photos) and they have to essentially slip inside little openings on the phone. But much of the time, they don't stay there! The base itself is powered by a micro USB cable, which I appreciate, since it isn't a proprietary connection to the actual base itself. But, the phone needs to truly be easy to charge. Maybe it is just ours? With as innefective as our charger is, it would be nice to have the option of a traditional charging port, even though that requires dexterity."
B01DRV2BBY,SYD,1,Bought this for my 9 year old mother who is hard of hearing. Itâs hard for me to hear. We tried all ring tones & volume high. It cuts out a lot. Great Call is not great at all to work with. We no longer use it so there is no satisfaction to this red lemon. Would advise anyone it to purchase.
B01DRV2BBY,Jack R,1,"I had the previous jitterbug, it worked fine for years. Died. And I bought the Easy-to-Use brand-new from a friend who got it but had a stroke. This one simply does not work. Takes about 3 seconds for every command. Texting, it hangs on each letter. I called technical support, they have reprogrammed it. Still doesn't work. I took it to a cell phone tech and they confirmed everything that I have observed, he could not send a text on it. Now I am searching for some other phone that is elderly-friendly. I notice other comparable reviews."
B01DRV2BBY,NatCurl,5,"I bought the jitterbug flip for my Grandmother 4 years ago and it still works like a charm. She is 96 years old and I asked her if she wanted me to purchase her an updated jitterbug. She said this one works just fine and she loves it. She sleeps with it under her pillow at night so she always has it close by. Of course she has hearing issues, she is 96 but she rarely has to ask me twice what I said during our conversations. My brother calls her every morning and I call her every afternoon for the last 4 years on the same jitterbug. Had an issue one time, customer service was great and it turned out that when I entered a phone number for her online I entered the wrong number. Thank so much to Great Call!! I will be calling soon to get a smart phone for myself!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer-KJM,5,"The Jitterbug flip phone is finally a phone my 88 yr old Dad can use with very few problems. The buttons are larger and easier to read and the text on the screen provides a larger font to see contacts in the address book. I can update, or add contact for him from home on my computer through the website. It has been a God send for our entire family but especially my Dad. I recommend this phone for anyone who is visually or hearing impaired or both. A wonderful asset and I'm so thankful I took him off my son's cell plan and signed up to Great Calls!!! I did purchase the Jitterbug at a Bestbuy as I wanted to talk to someone who knew something about them as opposed to ordering one online. I would now have no issues ordering one online now though."
B01DRV2BBY,GTR0419,4,"Overall the phone has been good. My mother in-law likes the large buttons, the overall size, and finds the red color easy to find if she forgets were she put it. Outside of two issues, it works as well as any other phone our family has. The first issue is that the ringer will stop working about once a week. If the phone is restarted, the ringer comes back. Odd. I'm actually not positive she isn't doing something. The second issue is more concerning. Twice over the six moths she has had it, it locked up and we had to do a hard reset to get it working. If she was in trouble and it locked up, bad news. Thank said, she was having a lot of trouble using her other phone due to it's size and she refused to use a smart phone. Not getting daily calls because she messed her phone up has been a big stress relief."
B01DRV2BBY,C. Faraone,1,"I bought it for our 91 y/o mother in a nursing home. She was always complaining about the size of her previous cell phoneâs numbers so I though this would be a major improvement.

So far the phone has been a pain in the butt. The interface is relatively simple and straightforward and yet annoying to use. I use electronic devices on a regular basis and this phone has a number of counter intuitive features.

On a number of occasions the unit has gotten squirrely (functions didnât function, callers kept hanging up because they couldnât hear mom when she answered).

After calling Great Call and waiting on hold for 20 plus minutes (after ignoring the recorded advice to call back due to high call volume) it was more than a little annoying to discover the Great Call operator hung up because he couldnât hear me.

Desperate, I turned the phone off and then back on and it worked. When I told my brother, he told me heâd done the same thing to clear up a different quirk with the phone. So the question is, how often does the phone have to be turned on and off?

Speaking of Great Call operators, when my sister called to set up the service an annoying rep (obviously a saleswoman) wasted an inordinate amount of time agressively trying to upsell services mom didnât need and wouldnât use. Itâs absurd to have to argue, justify, and explain to a salesperson about basic service being more than enough just to initiate service.

A while back, when mom had trouble with her Medical Alert unit (from the same company) she let the phone rep know how annoyed she was. I was astonished to be notified the service was turned off. (If my name wasnât on the account it would have remained off indefinitely.)

When I called the company, a supervisor was honest enough to admit heâd listened to the phone conversation involving my mother and the rep. It turned out she she didnât request termination. What happened was the creep was so annoyed at mom, he retaliated by turning off her service.

The supervisor was very apologetic BUT I was shocked to think some thin skinned phone rep would be spiteful enough to risk my mother's life by turning off a device designed to save lives."
B01DRV2BBY,Darlene P,1,"They changed the manufacturer from Samsung to Alcatel. Alcatel is below acceptable for this phone. I have a Alcatel smartphone and wish everyday I would have chose another brand. And there is not a holder that goes around the neck. If you try using any holder, it is usually to big to fit in the holder and the holder covers the ringer which muffles the ring and no senior including myself cannot hear the phone ring at maximum. So my mom is stuck holding the phone and constantly losing it. You would think there would be a place to hang a lanyard so a senior could wear it around their neck."
B01DRV2BBY,Reacher Fan 1909,4,"If all you need is a basic phone with reasonable minutes at a great price AND your area has Verizon service, you're set. If you text a great deal, get their smartphone. I don't, I just need a phone to make emergency calls and to have during power outages (frequent in my area). I also want on handy in case of road emergencies. I don't want to surf the net or text or play games, just call and for me it's PERFECT. I have high-speed internet at home so I'm set. Porting my number went quickly. I just periodically turned the phone on after speaking to my old and new carries and it was done in hours. Price is great and call clarity excellent."
B01DRV2BBY,Chen Sun,5,"My parents have resisted the smartphone, and even learning much about the cell phone. When my nearly 90 year old mother tried Great Call's Flip phone, she instantly appreciated that the earpiece and ringer sounds were louder and crisper. When I answered her call, I appreciated her clearer voice, made possible by Flipâs clearer microphone.

Flipâs speaker-phone is also loud and crisp, and its cameraâs lens doubles as a bright small flashlight and as a magnifying glass. A big red button to call for emergencies. Larger screen and phone buttons. Cell phones menus baffled my parents. Flip simplified this-- nearly all instructions are in large, plainly-written text, and need only simple yes or no responses. Very well designed for seniors.

Flip utilizes a phone-emergency-assistant service, which appears to be same as my prior reviewed Great Call's emergency telephony button, as seen here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5UC1L37RSZG/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCWEEPS&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=2335752011&store=wireless#wasThisHelpful . Lengthy URL! This button review, titled ""Very good emergency resources management service, July 14, 2014"" includes comparisons of competitive services. Notice also in the buttonâs review that the service has fail-safe features that correct errors seniors make with technology products. I believe Flip has comparable features.

I like Flip, and believe my parents will love this. About as much technology as my elderly parents can handle. Very well designedâsize of buttons, clarity and volume of speakers and microphone, very easy navigation, etc."
B01DRV2BBY,RETSmile,5,"I have had this service for my dad for several years and am beyond thrilled with it. He lives in a small town and is in his upper 70s. He still works so he uses this phone throughout the day to converse with me, clients, his secretary, etc. Being in such a rural area I thought he might have trouble with his coverage, but that is rare. And he much prefers this phone to even his house phone. He has trouble hearing and wears hearing aids in both ears and says he can just hear best on this phone.

You can go in online and setup your contact list and enter your emergency contact numbers as well as pertinent medical information. This new phone unit is different than the older model in that the 5Star button is located directly on the front as a one button connection rather than having to dial it. Whenever I have had to use customer service, they have been very helpful and are also very careful. They are acutely aware of people trying to scam seniors so they manage well that fine line of being helpful but also protecting against fraud for their customers.

We really like that this is a no nonsense unit. The numbers are easy to dial and it is easy to answer. It directs you where you need to go for what you want to do on the phone, be it speakerphone or voicemail. The screen is easy to see and easy to read and having the flip phone makes carrying and using it simple and intuitive. You can even set up a specific ring for the contact who is calling. I will say I don't think the camera and the magnifier on here work that great, but that is not why we have this phone and they won't be used that often. They are adequate for our needs.

We had tried other carriers and their units - we have asked for the very best for hearing impaired and the easiest to use. None of those are as good as the Jitterbug. We actually kept our other for a while before completely going to the Jitterbug to make sure we chose that which we like best. The Jitterbug is the clear winner and I'm glad we have this updated model with the emergency button on the front - it gives us peace of mind."
B01DRV2BBY,Prime Customer,1,"It worked just the opposite from what I thought. Flip closed didn't turn it off. My $14 subscription ended up around $24 after taxes and stuff! This senior found it hard to understand. I am keeping my TracFone flip phone, it works and is much cheaper."
B01DRV2BBY,Lori,5,"She was recently hospitalized and had difficulty using the cell phone she's had for years. So I ordered her a smart phone, disabled the WiFi and data, but she couldn't even swipe. I did my research and found Jitterbug and I can't emphasize enough how wonderful it is. You only pay for what you want -- in this case, just phone calls, no texts or voicemail because she can't work either of them. The phone is a great size when you open it. The color makes it easy to find it in her purse. The ring is adorable. The cell phone problem after she got out of the hospital was virtually a crisis. Problem solved. So glad I went with the Jitterbug. And the price is better on Amazon. Love love love."
B01DRV2BBY,Donna,5,"We are in our 60's and hubby has gone without a phone since he retired 10 years ago. Was not interested in a phone since most of his career he carried two phones. A situation came up this pass summer and he had to drive across the desert in the middle of summer with no phone. I told him ""that is it"" you are getting a phone to help relieve the stress you put me under when you are out and about. So he received an early Christmas present and got a phone,. He does not want to tex, or have access to anything. Just to make calls and take a couple of pictures here and there. The flip phone does text but he is not interested in that - just make calls. I did a lot of research on phones since I am somewhat of a tech person and decided on this phone. Its great and everything he wanted......THANK GOD!!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,1,"I bought the Jitterbug for its 5Star button, but I am fed up seeing ""charging critical"" because it needs charging regularly (like every few days) and as I don't have any other use for the phone to remind me that it needs charging so often, I think the Jitterbug is a waste of money. In other words, the 5Star emergency button is only as good as the battery and I am going to ask for my money back."
B01DRV2BBY,luvtoshop,2,"I just discontinued service after 3 years. Reason: Had to call several times due to problems with phone. The customer service was not very good. Finally, the speaker would not work and I had to call several times on that. The check-in call was not reliable. Some days would not get check-in call or it was late. Then I found out that the check-in call really doesn't mean anything. I thought if they couldn't reach you, they would call 911 or your contacts. Not so!! The only time they will call your contacts is if you push the 5 Star button. If you faint or have a stroke, and cannot push the 5 Star button, you are out of luck. I have the old shell flip phone and I understand the new Jitterbug flip is hard to open."
B01DRV2BBY,Jack S.,1,"Unfortunately we have had problem after problem with this phone. They rolled out a new phone without adequate testing, and the seniors who depend on having a working phone are the ones who pay. There is a software bug that causes the phone to remain off when you open it. They have a patch, but it doesn't always work. We have been through three phones, all with issues. They send a ""warranty"" replacement, which is just another phone with problems. Sometimes the phone remains on indefinitely when closing the phone.

Another issue is the outgoing sound. It can be extremely muffled, so the person using the Flip cannot be easily understood. The person must use their other hand to bring the phone closer to their mouth in order to be heard. Great Call is stuck with selling this awful phone, and they will continue to claim it's ""new"" and they're still working out the issues. It's a shame we've spent so much time just trying to get a working phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Lynn McCormick,5,"My husband is 72 and has a significant hearing loss as well as challenges with technology. He had 2 other flip phones which he couldn't hear ring and eventually lost. He has done well with the Jitterbug. He can hear it ring, hear the speaker, understand the directions on how to use it, and has managed to keep track of it. My only complaint was in activating the phone. The directions said to ""Press the on/off button"" to turn it on. Nothing was happening when I did that. I finally figured out that I needed to ""Press and HOLD the on/off button"" to get the phone to initially turn on. Hopefully Jitterbug will fix this wording issue."
B01DRV2BBY,Twiggy,1,Bought several of these for my 90+ YO mother. We have had 4 Jitterbugs in last 2 years. They are not designed for the elderly!!! Volume very low on highest setting in the ear piece. Hard to work buttons. Too complicated for elderly to figure out. Horrible option. She cannot hear it ring on loudest setting. Stops working after a few months hence 4 different non working phones...Not under warranty.
B01DRV2BBY,DenverGuy,1,Donât waste your money. My wife bought this phone and immediately returned it after her first bill from Great Call. Cheaply made and Great Call ainât so great either. Had to pay a restocking fee to Great Call even though it was purchased from Amazon.
B01DRV2BBY,EJ Honda,3,"My mom's previous Jitterbug was starting to lose battery longevity, so I decided to take advantage of Great Call's offer for a free upgrade to this latest model. Right from the get-go, it has had very disappointing battery life. Despite my mom living just outside Baltimore and having a ""strong"" signal, it won't hold a charge for 24hrs even if it isn't used. Not sure why this is happening, but I'm frustrated and will be reaching out to Great Call to see if they have any answers. We've had very good luck with the previous phone and customer service in the past."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"The phone is ok. My mother in law had a hard time using it though.
But the real problem is getting yourself out of the contract. You have to call them and I am now on about 40 minutes on hold. They try to make it so hard to get out you'll forget about it.
There is apparently nowhere on the website to cancel service. They make you go through the phone lines.
Creepy. Like dealing leeches that won't let go."
B01DRV2BBY,MaryP,5,"Finally after many years and many phones, we found a phone my 81 y/o mom can and enthusiastically uses. She only does the basics, so this phone is perfect for her. The customer support is great."
B01DRV2BBY,joseph d. vinarski,1,"Have had phone for several months without a glitch. Suddenly, I was unable to either forward or receive photos . The screen shows ""photo successfully sent'"" but it never arrives to its destination, just vanishes. I attempted sending one to my own number and it shows on the screen that ""you have a new TEXT message"". Contacted customer service, was on the phone for close to an hour with unsuccessful attempts at rebooting, software updates and finally a puzzled rep telling me that it may be the phone. No kidding. So I'm stuck with a piece of garbage that can send and receive texts but is incapable of handling photos. Save your money, your blood pressure will thank you."
B01DRV2BBY,Brian M. Smith,1,"Would not do business with GreatCalls. Flooded my cell phone with repeated telemarketing calls from call center. ,12 in a single afternoon. I called them back demanding they stop calling me. Person said they couldn't remove my number from call list. Transfered me. Next person said they couldn't do it but would get supervisor. Same person came back,said they had a number for me to call to get my number off the list.. I said they needed to remove my number, not me and where is your supervisor? Put me on hold a long time. Same person came back, said supervisor only takes calls from customers.. Gave me a number saying, again, I had to call it to have my number removed. Number they gave me is Federal No Call list. My phone has been registered on it since the beginning and registration regularly updated. GreatCalls is flagrantly breaking the law."
B01DRV2BBY,Heather Paola,1,"Cheap cell phone plans through Great Call which is what my mom needed. About $15 a month for 200 minutes or so. So That's awesome. Has a cool little stand charger that my mom found easier then the plug. That was good.
My mom had trouble with the phone but she has dementia so might not be the norm.
Bad thing about phone for her was when she missed a call in would give her an audible notification every 5 minutes which she didnt understand how to make it stop. There is no way to turn that audible notification off so that sucks.
Then... Phone just stopped working after about 3 weeks to a month. Don't understand why just doesn't work any longer. So I will need to contact them to get a new one."
B01DRV2BBY,BermudaOnion,4,"This phone is easy to use and perfect for seniors with it's large keypad and loud speaker. It's an entry level phone that's difficult to text on and doesn't connect to the internet. It comes with a few games loaded but they're kind of cheesy. There are lots of services available with this phone - for instance, you can have someone call to remind you to take your medicine - but they all come with a price and adding all of those extra features would be expensive.

I did have some questions at set up and called customer service. They were very friendly but couldn't help me. They promised to have a supervisor call back between 3 and 4 that day but they never did. I emailed the next day and was able to get the issue resolved."
B01DRV2BBY,Jan Moore,1,"Bought it for my 98-year-old mother on recommendation of an assisted living center. Operation is not at all transparent: very confusing. What's more, during the time my mother was trying to use it there was a usage/transmission problem which the company would acknowledge IF you asked the question ""why isn't my phone working?"" We thought it was our mother's cognitive problem so didn't report it - and when we discontinued service with Great Call they gave us no credit for that period. By the way, Great Call seems to be the service provider - and it is WAY too expensive for basic service. Their rationale for high service cost is the medical alerts included - but it a person is in a facility already it has its own medical alert system. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! My sister can't even figure it out, and she's pretty young!"
B01DRV2BBY,Carolyn J. Mears,5,"Bought the new Jitterbug Flip Phone for my sister three weeks ago, with the Text and Talk only plan, but she doesn't use Text. So far, we're both very pleased with her new phone, because it's so SIMPLE and EASY to use. My sister's older Jitterbug version and plan only provided 50 minutes a month (for $19.95), but she likes the phone so much, she has begun using her Jitterbug exclusively, so it seemed fun to upgrade her to the new RED flip phone and a plan that provides 600 monthly minutes for about the same cost as the old plan."
B01DRV2BBY,Digerati Ohm,1,"I don't even want to give it one star. First, if you're typing a text and get a phone call or another text it wipes the text you were working on. Second, after several months we noticed the clock on the phone was an hour off. After several calls it still isn't right. Also, after some updates the microphone on the phone stopped working intermittently and sometimes would work if you rebooted the phone. But this really concerned me when we tried to call 911 for an auto accident (not us, thank God) and the dispatcher couldn't hear us. If this was an emergency we could have been in real trouble. I will say their help desk people are real friendly and as helpful as they can be, but if they can't fix their problems then I'll find another phone, which is what I did."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"I really like my Jitterbug Flip phone as it is easy to use, I am able to store numbers I call often in the phone book. It also includes 5-Star , the emergency program that I used to have in separate item before & then I also had a cell phone so I had 2 items that I had to carry. I keep it charged in the desktop charger that came with it. Mine is silver colored and flip also comes in red. I can accept text messages on the flip, this I can't do on my land line so I am very happy that I invested in the flip ;last Sept.2017."
B01DRV2BBY,Marian Stanley,1,"Terrible experience. Got this product for my husband. One hardware problem after another. Phone had to be replaced, then the charging cradle was defective, multiple service calls. Finally just cancelled the contract and tossed the phone and charger after a last maddening conversation with a tech specialist. Got an ATT flip phone for my husband and everything works just fine. Jitterbug Great Call seems like a scam for seniors. I use an iPhone."
B01DRV2BBY,Joe Warren,1,Not dependable for the elderly. When a software upgrade is required the phone shuts down and requires a removal of the battery then reinstall then turn back on procedure to reactivate service. Over the past year I have had to go to my moms house and perform this operation 4 times because the phone was deactivated.
B01DRV2BBY,Just Me,5,"Great phone for my aging mother. Big buttons and screen is fairly large. Simple menu and Yes/No buttons make it easy for her to use. I love that I am able to manage her account online, including her Phone Book so I can add contacts for her at any time. We're not using the 5 star button feature yet, but I'm glad to have that option available and will likely be adding that service in the near future. I love that you can decide which services you need and only pay for what you need. There's nothing else out there for senior cell phones -- I've looked! Jitterbug / GreatCall is awesome."
B01DRV2BBY,memere,5,"It's like having your own body guard ! It helps to know there is a trained agent to speak with 24-7 should you need help ! My phone helps me to feel secure and safe and the best thing that, I ever did for myself !!! I highly recommend this great call cell phone ! I can talk anywhere and never loose communication unlike other cell l phones! and this is a great feature that anyone should be looking at when purchasing a cell phone !! As an older person, I wouldn't think twice about buying it again !!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,C. Hill,5,"This Jitterbug Flip Easy-to-Use Cell Phone for Seniors is a practical solution for those that don't want or need the advanced features found on most modern cell phones.

The phone comes with a charger and was very easy to set up and get working. We really did not want the games or other built in apps and are only using this for phone calls. The buttons are large and most screen prompts use the ""Yes"" or ""No"" buttons for selection. I like that ""Dial Tone"" can be heard when the phone is flipped open since this is a sound most Seniors are very comfortable hearing and know what to do when it starts.

We have fairly good coverage in our area and the phone conversations are decent quality on both ends of the call, but I suspect results will vary based on physical location.

Highly Recommended!

B01DRV2BBY,Avid Reader,5,"The Jitterbug Flip is super comfortable to use. The large, well-labelled keys, and yes/no prompts make it a breeze to adapt to. The 5Star function provides priceless peace of mind for me. It means a lot to know I just have to press a button and help is at hand. Also found the magnifier and super bright flashlight very handy. I love the attractive design and shape.Even a 20-something co-worker admired the way it looked. Wherever I go, the Jitterbug makes my life easier."
B01DRV2BBY,IRead IWrite,3,"I'm happy with the Text and Talk functions but not the camera. I have not been able to get my photos out of the camera using a USB Cable, nor have I been able to register my Facebook account at GreatCall.com to send photos to Facebook, as they promised. I did send a photo to a friend's smart phone who emailed it to my email account and I was able to retrieve the photo on my computer that way. It's a very low resolution camera and the photo was very grainy."
B01DRV2BBY,yoyoma,5,"Very good phone for seniors & others who may have vision problems or other disabilities.
I wish this was available when my mom was alive because it would have been so easy for her.
It's very simple to use and figure out even without the instruction book.

I set mine up in the bedroom, very easy, my only negative is that the picture in the instruction book does not show which way to set the phone in the cradle & I can see some people being confused by that but it's easy to figure out.

My favorite thing about the phone is the ease of overall use. It has simple yes/no buttons, you really don't have to remember any commands. Easy to take & send pictures as well.It's much simpler than other phones I have used.

It also has a one touch emergency button that I think is also very good for seniors & others.

The only drawback I see is that it's a bit too simple for me as I like to text & I don't see any way to use any punctuation or emoji, but again texting is simple to do even in places where it is hard to see."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"Tried this service with this flip phone. Stopped working the first week.
Had to stay on the line with company for hours troubleshooting the problem, before they
Finally agreed to take the phone back. Next phone lasted about three weeks. Again had to troubleshoot the problem for several hours. Sent phone back. Third phone lasted about 6 weeks. My advice......donât buy this flip phone. They are all defective.
The amount of time spent âtroubleshootingâ was ridiculous. Waste of my time."
B01DRV2BBY,C. DeRousse,5,"1. I did NOT order from Amazon - I ordered directly from GreatCall after a horrendous experience with Consumer Cellular.
2. This is an EXCELLENT basic flip phone for those seeking a simple phone or not wanting a smartphone.
3. I purchased this phone for a senior relative who began having challenges with her basic touchscreen smartphone.
4. The phone covers all the basics with built in flashlight, 2 megapixel camera, speakerphone, easy to read menus and address book. It also has Bluetooth, but I haven't used that feature.
5. Reception, call clarity and speaker phone are fantastic.
6. Customer service is AMAZING. Very helpful, understanding AND in the U.S.
7. I absolutely LOVE that I could create an online account and manage the address book online. Makes it so much easier than the other person having to program phone numbers."
B01DRV2BBY,Beejay,4,"I traded a smaller 5 year old Jitterbug for the newer, larger Jitterbug mainly for my husband, who has hearing aids in both ears. He was having trouble hearing calls from our children and grandchildren. The new Jitterbug has improved his hearing their message, but it still isn't perfect. Several relatives have come to check on us because they had called and we hadn't answered. When we checked the incoming messages, theirs were not recorded. So we may be missing some calls. All together I think the new Jitterbug is probably an improvement, but I am thankful we didn't pay an enormous charge to make the change from a 5 year old one."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,I`ve been using Jitterbug phones now for several years and am very pleased with the phones and the service when I have had a problem.What problems I have had were taken care of by customer service who in my experience have been very friendly and willing to help.I used the Jitterbug plus for several years and just recently went to the Jitterbug flip which I am loving so far.These phones work well for me as I like the ease of them as they are not complicated.They have everything I need and not a bunch of things I don`t.The plans are very reasonable in cost and you can have what you want on your phone.My brother got me my first Jitterbug a few years ago as he is the older one but did not want to carry a cell phone so I got one so we would have a phone with us to call if we needed help of some kind.As I said I just recently got my Jitterbug flip and am very happy with it so far.The only thingthat I can say otherwise is that the company made a small mistake when they mailed me my phone as I had actually ordered a red one but got a gray one instead.This is okay as I `m not worried about color just a phone that works and gives good service.I`ve gotten that from the Jitterbug.
B01DRV2BBY,J. A. Lynn,3,After paying for the phone and various fees it was considerably higher than quoted. Then after dropping to the most basic of the plans I calculated I was paying over $250 annually for a phone hardly ever used! I am calling to cancel the service today when their Pacific time office opens!
B01DRV2BBY,Martha W.,5,"I purchased this phone for my 89 year old father who recently moved into assisted living. He has never used a cell phone before (despite my getting him one many years ago) because he's technology phobic and insists he can't figure them out. This phone is very simple to use and while he still struggles with remembering how to use it, he often can figure it out without too much difficulty. It's loud, which is good since he's hard of hearing, and the numbers are big. You flip it open to answer it and close it to end a call. The Yes and No buttons are used to place calls to numbers already in the phone book. Using the phone book may be the biggest challenge because of needing to remember to scroll through it to find the number you want to call. For someone not use to using a directory of this sort, it's hard to remember to do that."
B01DRV2BBY,Kay,3,"One thing that makes this phone different from others is the âyesâ or ânoâ feature. For example if you want to take a picture......while scrolling down the menu, when the word âcameraâ is highlighted, you push the âyesâ button, and the camera feature appears, ready for picture taking. If you push ânoâ, the phone scrolls down to the next feature. If you donât want to use the yes/no feature, you can use the arrow keys to scroll, then push âyesâ to select the desired item.
All number buttons, as well as the menu items are large and easy to read. Also the speaker volume and ring tone can be adjusted very loud.
The 5 Star feature is the most unique and important feature. Just push the red button and an operator will answer to help in any situation. This eliminates the need to wear a call button around your neck. Some people find a neck button awkward, and this combines 2 services into one, with only 1 bill to pay.
Finally, the red cover is beautiful and easy to find, and the size of the phone is perfect!"
B01DRV2BBY,Mary fox,5,Jitterbug has made life easier for my husband. The phone is thicker than AT&T flip phone and fits better in his larger hands. The buttons are large enough that he does not hit two or more buttons at a time. The emergency red button make me know that he can receive help when I am not right at his side. I had a jitterbug phone for my Mom. There was no question about getting one for my husband as he has aged. The red color makes it easy for him to find.
B01DRV2BBY,miac888,2,BUYER BEWARE!!! this phone's carrier does not work in all areas. I was going to buy it for my 91 year old dad and found out that is does not work in my zip code. Make sure you check your area before buying this.
B01DRV2BBY,Barb,1,"It doesn't hold it's charge... I have to keep it off to hold a charge for any length of time. It grunts when it wants charged, and I use it only for calling my husband. They say they have plans for as little as $14.99, but I haven't seen that low price since I bought this phone some years ago... now I pay $26 for it and I use it about five times a week. I left it on by accident today, and when it grunted that it was critical battery, it was HOT! I'm going to get a trac phone... paying $26 a month for about 20 calls is ridiculous! And don't fall for the big numbers and good screen... the flip is so small, nothing is is BIG! Do I sound angry... I am, because I only want a flip phone for emergencies and short calls, and it is costing me $26 for that."
B01DRV2BBY,frequent buyer,5,"I LOVE this phone. So easy to use. I have had other phones with so much on them that was useless to me. and the service was more expensive. This is exactly what I was looking for. I can call, text, take pictures, send and receive pictures and get phone messages. I don't need anything else! I can also get games, but don't want to. The price for the service is great. The only thing I was unaware of was that I would have to pay 10 cents to send or receive pictures; however the service is cheap enough that I don't mind - don't use it that much anyway. Love the *5 button."
B01DRV2BBY,Totally Retired,5,"The Jitterbug flip phone may make younger folks laugh, but who cares. This cell phone is all I need and it always works. I bought one for my wife and me primarily to take with us when we're driving around town taking care of business and running errands. We're not one of these people who has a cell phone constantly glued to one ear, nor do we text all day or while we're driving. This Jitterbug phone is great for calling someone for assistance or just checking in with my wife when I'm out and about running around town. It has a telephone directory to call people I need, a camera, and the ability to text. One great feature is the extended battery life. I've had the battery registering 32%, and the phone functioned as well as it did when it was charged at 97%. Finally, the customer service at Great Call is simply outstanding. Regardless of the situation, no customer service rep at Great Call makes you feel stupid for asking for help with a techno question or problem. They walk you through the issue while providing instructional information how they will correct the problem. It's a great product."
B01DRV2BBY,PV,1,"Ringtone is too low even at maximum volume. Call quality is terrible; static. Calls drop constantly; I had to call back my dad 3 times during a 5 minute call. When someone calls, sometimes it rings, sometimes it doesn't. We've only had this phone for 2 weeks. Frankly, I think we got a defective phone."
B01DRV2BBY,MDM,5,"Bought it for my 88 year old father who has macular degeneration and is hard of hearing. The numbers on the key pad and screen are easy to see. The menu is easy to navigate. Volume, sound quality and flashlight are good. Magnifier isn't the greatest. He doesn't have the 5Star service but we like that it can be added on if needed. And no contract is nice. All in all, it's easier for him to use than his last basic phone and he's happy with it."
B01DRV2BBY,Chalis,5,"I have a cell phone primarily for possible emergency situations and don't use it often. Simplicity of use is very important to me. The Jitterbug has all the features I need. The screen contains simple instructions on use, and those instructions are available every time I use it. In fact I use it a little more because I don't have refer to a users manual every time I want to make a call. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
B01DRV2BBY,Lisa,5,"Bought this phone for my 87 year old Mom and she loves it. It is easy to use and has nice large buttons. The customer support at GreatCall was awesome and walked me through setting up the phone and features. When Mom accidently pushed the 5* alert button, the operator was very kind, understanding and reassured her that they would always be there for her if she needed them. Great product and customer service!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Rodney Westervelt,1,"I bought it for outdoor furniture cover, followed directions and didn't hold, could be the type of material.I was trying to fix. NOT sure"
B01DRV2BBY,Judy Ackermann,5,"I got the Jitterbug Flip for my elderly mother after a fiasco with a Samsung Smart phone. It has been an absolute GODSEND. Unbelievably easy to set up and use; it's as if senior citizens got together to design a phone and input all the things they want/need. I input all first & last names of contacts and then initiated voice-dialing for my mother. The Flip phone voce had difficulty recognizing the last names of contacts so I deleted all last names (online). Problem solved! Not having to remember a password for voice-mail? Brilliant! Ease of taking pictures and looking at the photo album? Simple! Every operator we've talked to has been extremely easy to talk to and seems to know to explain things in non-techno-speak and one or two syllable words.

Complaints? Mom doesn't like that the 'On/Off' switch is right above the 'NO' button and wishes the volume rocker-button was not on the side of the phone. When a senior answers the (Flip) phone, they grab it tightly and can sometimes press the rocker which can turn the volume all the way down. She would also like something like a lanyard to hang it around her neck. I got her a passport cross-body pouch and that solved the problem."
B01DRV2BBY,A M Dawson,5,"Bought this for my 81 year old Mother who is visually impaired & has been struggling with standard phones for a while. When she saw this phone she was so happy that everything was big & bold & she could see what she was doing. She doesn't really need to use it much but she wants it with her for that comfort feeling. She has the 5Star option too so it makes me feel happy that help is not far away if she needs it.
Definitely would recommend for the elderly."
B01DRV2BBY,9523,4,"I read somewhere that you can stick a pin into the power outlet. It works. After getting text messages that I am not signed up for and the phone beeping over and over and over again which woke me up, I started looking online for answers. I found a pin and inserted it into the power plug in of the phone. I moved the pin back and forth and finally I was able to turn it off."
B01DRV2BBY,Lorraine,3,My father purchased this from Greatcall. As a phone it is ok. But I thought it would be fun for my father to stay in touch with grandchildren via text. We started looking at it. The texting system is Ancient! I mean back in the 1990s. There are so many steps in the Jitterbug texting when it should be straight forward. Why has the texting system not been brought up to date? Yes many older folks arenât interested but at least make it easily accessible to those that would like to!
B01DRV2BBY,JERM,1,"I bought this phone for my Dad for the ease of use. He really loved it -until 4 months later it literally fried on the inside while it was charging. This left my elderly father without a phone for over a week while getting a replacement. I was worried. He lives alone -in the boonies. I bought him the phone for safety reasons and not only did the thing get super hot and melt inside - but my elderly Dad was without a phone for a few days! "" GreatCall""'s customer service acknowledged the overheating/melting problem and said they'd since corrected it and the newer models were fixed. Not true. The exact same thing happened again to his replacement phone. My Dad gave up and got an Iphone. I cancelled ""GreatCall"" and they did NOT refund my money for the phone - even though it was a manufacturing defect and even though the warranty was renewed with the replacement phone.
Bottom line: If you want to keep your seniors safe - Do NOT get them the Jitterbug Flip. Not only is it a potential fire hazard - but it could leave your loved one without a phone for a while."
B01DRV2BBY,hywelda,5,"My husband and I are 70 years old and never had a cell phone before. Due to a health problem, I needed one for him. He knows zilch about technology, and I have bad eyesight. The Jitterbug is the best phone out there for folks like us - simple, easy to use, large buttons and large DARK print. It works for what we want it to do, and at a much better price than most other companies."
B01DRV2BBY,Harper,4,"I purchased this for my elderly mother who wears hearing aids and has a difficult time seeing small print. She needed something very easy and this was it. She loves the large buttons and easy YES - NO questions. The only thing I dont like is that you get a dial tone every time you open it. My mom took her first ever picture with a cell phone today, it's that easy! I'm happy with the purchase."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"I was given a prepaid c ell phone that could do everthing this thing could for severasl hundred dollars less.I don't feel safe walking to my car?????? REALLY....I am lost??/ This phone service is ridiculous and having a phone that is more durable less expensice by many hundreds of dollars is simply better,unless you're completely over come by alzheimers in which case you shouldn't be friving or walking alone anyway."
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara Ross,5,"My husband has Alzheimer Disease and is in a Memory Care facility. I have the phone set up so all he has to do is flip it open, press 'yes', and it will automatically call me. We talk twice a day and it give him a feeling of security to know that he can reach me. I love having the date and time displayed and highlighted on the phone when it is shut and in its stand. He can then cross off the date on the monthly calendar of events as the day ends so he always knows what activities to take part in the next day. One bit of advice: I bought the phone at Best Buy and paid 90% more than if I had ordered the phone from Amazon. It is a perfect phone for someone with Dementia."
B01DRV2BBY,D Kovnat,5,"The Jitterbug Flip phone is extremely easy to use right out of the box. The screen is easy to read, the functions menu is easy to navigate. There is a one-touch button called 5Star that connects to agents who can help you if you have an emergency. I have traveled with this phone and it has worked great in every state I traveled to. The phone receives texts well, you can reply quickly using standard phrases that are stored in the phone's memory, or use the keypad to send a specific text. Overall I would recommend this phone for someone who does not
find texting important, but just primarily needs a phone for making phone calls."
B01DRV2BBY,Edward A. Radek,5,"Got this for my 95 year old mother, she loves it. Smart phones were too complicated and regular flip phones were too small. She likes the sound quality, the large buttons and the easy navigation. I like the excellent customer service and the price is very reasonable. I also like that it's on the Verizon network."
B01DRV2BBY,Mick,2,"I bought this for my now 91 yr. old Father for his BDay in 2015? It needs to be rebooted DAILY, which he CANNOT understand. The location feature works...80% of the time, which is nice, except for the other 20%.
The hardware/phone itself CANNOT be locked on full volume, you CANNOT BLOCK ANY NUMBERS...
For the price, I would NOT recommend. I am buying a LARGE BUTTON cell phone, that he can operate, and hear. Maybe the other models are better? But the Jitterbug Flip/Red one, leaves a LOT to be desired!"
B01DRV2BBY,Colleen,5,"Jitterbug is a perfect name, as we all did that in our time, lol. I DO NOT text, so it's perfect for my arthritic fingers. It has a library with a few phrases for you to send those pesky texters who insist on texting to us. All you do is hit the button for the phrase you choose, and away your message goes. Letters are big. Buttons are big. Volume is great. I LOVE IT!"
B01DRV2BBY,Alaska Chick,5,"Called the number from the Ad in the AARP magazine. They explained everything and in three days (no xtra charges) got my phone, all set up and even with my top 4 phone numbers input. I love the large buttons, the simple yes/no choices. I like everything about it and about saving $20 a month on my cell phone bill."
B01DRV2BBY,Ed VALLEE,5,"Bought this for my wife after trying several other brands with many bells and whistles, she is not tech savy at all ,this one she can use. That what this is ====a phone, you want bell and whistles===look elsewhere but with the extras available== it can't be beat"
B01DRV2BBY,Kate,1,"I have not bought this phone but I have done days of research and want to share what I've learned. I am blown away at all the negative reviews for every single aspect of this phone and Great Call. While overall it gets better reviews than other senior-targeted options, I am actually discouraged that this company has more hidden fees than any of the others. A fee to send a photo, a fee to setup ($35) when you are doing them a favor by adding to their revenue. While they claim they target seniors they obviously do not consider seniors on a fixed income, again catering to those who have higher income and can easily afford all the costs associated with this phone and a plan that gets as many negative reviews for customer service, etc and the cheapest other options. If I'm going to pay $150 for the newest model I want much higher consistency in quality of the phone as well as customer service. Go to several other web sites and research for yourself before considering the highest priced senior targeted phone and service out there."
B01DRV2BBY,melissa Coe,1,"Be careful, elderly people can easily be mislead by the large $14.99 price advertised on the box. There are also connection fees only listed in tiny print on the bottom of the box. The customer service is variable so please know your total fees plus taxes before you buy! Very unhappy with the way this is presented to Seniors."
B01DRV2BBY,L. Peltier,5,I tried several other phones and the jitterbug is by far the easiest phone there is for someone who has poor eyesight and just wants the basics to communicate. I am finally happy and feel safe when i leave my home that I am able to use this phone with no issues. I am tempted to try the smartphone but maybe I should just leave well enough alone.
B01DRV2BBY,T Weekly,4,We've had this phone for about 3 months now and love it. It was easy to activate and is so easy to use. The ability to set up your directory on-line is a big plus. Love the big numbers the intuitive yes/no method of finding the function you want. We live in Florida where it is easy to find service everywhere and we just returned from a trip to the west coast where it worked flawlessly. The only reason I didn't rate 5-stars is that it takes an exceptionally long time to boot up when first turned on.
B01DRV2BBY,Skye Jones,5,"For 30 years I had two telephones on my office desk at Oxford University. When I retired I vowed to forsake telephones altogether, but discovered I did need to be able to phone out (plumber, electrician, emergency services, etc.) even if I did not want incoming calls. My main line of communications is e-mail - not telephone. But I am impressed by my Jitterbug Flip, which sounds like a drink one might order in a bar, but is an entirely user-friendly device which I am happy to have."
B01DRV2BBY,K. J.,4,"I really like my Jitterbug Flip Phone. I don't need to take care of the world with a phone and the Jitterbug fills my needs perfectly. Easy to use, easy to see the screen. However, I would like it better if the names in the address book would automatically come up alphabetically."
B01DRV2BBY,Texas Butterfly,5,"The Jitterbug Flip Phone is the perfect cell phone for me. I am not technical and am ""scared to death"" of Smartphones. This phone does what I need it to do -- it is easy to use to make calls when I am out of the house or out of town. I love the large number buttons, which make it simple to make phone calls. My only complaint so far is that my saved phone numbers are not in alphabetical order, but that does me no great harm. I hope we never need the special emergency service, but it's good to know that's also there."
B01DRV2BBY,Lsk,5,"The first thing to know about the Jitterbug mobile phone is that it is a two-in-one device,
namely the marriage of a mobile phone with a medical alert system. This phone kills two birds with one stone and makes the ""I've fallen and can't get up"" beeper worn around the neck unnecessary. Press the red 5-Star button and an emergency operator will respond. A notable health and safety feature is the ability to message the smart phones of family and friends if there is no response to a programed daily check-in call. Other cool features are 24/7 access to doctors and nurses and daily reminders to take medications.

This phone was built for the elderly. Large fonts and intuitive navigation make the phone easy to use. The built-in magnification and light feature comes in handy.

In my home the phone's signal strength was reported as Poor. However, there was no
problem hearing and being heard. The signal strength went from poor to fair to good as I walked a few yards from my home.

The phone charged to 98% with a few hours. Three days later with minimal use the charge was at 61%, estimating a charge could last approximately one week with limited usage. I cannot at this time report how long the charge would last with greater use.

The only problem incurred was the charging stand did not work. For me, not an issue since I prefer plugging the cord directly into the phone.

In summary, anyone looking for a simple, easy to use mobile phone with the added benefits of medical alert system the Jitterbug fills the bill quite well."
B01DRV2BBY,LRQ,1,"Locked down to Great Cell with no way of using a different SIM. The 3G version of this phone was great and wasn't locked like this. I had high hopes for this new version, 4g LTE etc.. But now I will have to return it. Also, this phone really isn't that intuitive for seniors -- ie, it has a 'Yes' and 'No' button rather than hangup and dial buttons -- that's not intuitive."
B01DRV2BBY,Sally's Perceptions,5,"My 'Jitterbug' cell phone is a 'Great Gift' to my life; at 86 years of age, I have Hearing Loss and Texting makes sure I did NOT hear correctly on my Land Line. Also I have the Joy of taking Photos, with my Camera INSIDE my little phone, I can Add and Delete Ph. #s, Text and , Voice messages. AND I KEEP MY CELL WITH ME ALL THE TIME FOR GOOD REASONS AND ONE OF THE BEST IS MY RED 5 * ...I appreciate the large letters and all the conveniences for Vision inconveniences ! WITH GREAT JOY, I SAY ""THANK YOU FROM MY HEART' GREAT CALL ! ""
Sally Nave, Mesa, AZ"
B01DRV2BBY,Terry Hull,5,"My stepdad loves flip-phones because he can drop it in his pocket. When my Mom passed away, every time I was around him he told me how much he hated the flip-phone he had. He claimed it was too hard to see the tiny buttons and he couldn't hear it ring and that it was even difficult to talk on. My sister was constantly having to ""fix"" his phone for him. I got him a Jitterbug Flip-Phone and he loves it! All he wants it for is making and receiving phone calls. It's perfect for him."
B01DRV2BBY,Ted Burch,5,"Purchased this last month for a family member with vision and mobility issues. He is quite pleased with its ease of use, as well as the peace of mind it provides. Prior experiences with power failures and loss of land-line service were distressing. These problems are now a thing of the past. Very satisfied with our purchase."
B01DRV2BBY,R. Christie,4,"I'm pleased with the technical performance of the phone. If you buy it directly from Great Calls AND have it pre-activated you should be OK. Administrative performance is less certain. We had ordered a flip phone and a Smart Phone at the same time. When we went to set up owner accounts confusion prevailed as to which account belonged to which phone. This took a while to iron out but was ultimately resolved., The owner's manual is clear and comprehensive and the rates pleasant compared with the competition"
B01DRV2BBY,L V Hernandez,5,"My 91-year old father struggles with his Android for the duration of the contract. Hard to read texts even harder to get to the texts! Kept saying it was smarter than him but the real reason is because it was difficult to handle with his 91-year old hands. As soon as the contract ended I got him the Jitterbug Flip based on the glowing reports I got from a friend with MS. Easy to use, easy to navigate and best of all easy to see! Ordering from Great Call was the second best thing. Their customer service is awesome and porting over the old cell number to his Jitterbug was easy. No need for him to figure out who to contact to tell them to update their phone lists! Best phone & service for someone like my dad!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"I had trouble with the complexities of my smart phone. The Jitterbug does everything I need to do, and it is so easy to understand and to use. The numbers and letters are large, it's so simple to scroll up or down and to simply indicate yes or no for a function. Calling and answering a call couldn't be easier, and that's all I really need it for, but it also has a camera, which is a bonus as far as I am concerned. I love it."
B01DRV2BBY,K. Hernandez,5,"My MIL loves this phone, although we had a little trouble setting it up to work with service. The big numbers are just what her tired eyes need. Heck, I could use some big numbers on my phone and I'm not anywhere near as old as she is! For a phone for elders with the few critical features they need, this is perfect."
B01DRV2BBY,Gail,5,"I love my new flip phone. It is so simple and easy to use. I only pay for what I want, no contracts. The volume is great. I can't here the phone well. I like the size, fits well in my pocket or purse. I down graded from an iPhone. The iPhone was too big and my plan was very expensive. I didn't need most of the stuff on it. Jitter bug was a great buy, I recommend it."
B01DRV2BBY,Ken Stedman,5,"This new phone is very easy to use. Being 75 now and having MS, my gate is on the losing side. After falling several time and stumbling a lot these days, my wife feels confident that as I am out by myself I have something to rely on. I was never one to carry my former cell, which was very good, but easily going off as I bumped into things. Hence, just very disturbing to the point of not wanting to take the phone with me. Now, with the Jitterbug flip, all those former distractions are now gone."
B01DRV2BBY,LDC50,4,"There is no phone that will solve all the Senior problems, but this is MUCH better than the LG Flip phone thru the local phone company.
One request: Lanyard hook, so could be a necklace.
Support excellent. I think USA, as no accent.
This is a CDMA phone, so is on Verizon, so good coverage."
B01DRV2BBY,Fern,2,"Bought one in April 2018. Now in July it no longer can send photos to Facebook. The help people said it is a software problem in all of the Flips now. They said to send my pictures to my email address but I can't find any info on how where the @ icon is or how to switch back and forth from numbers to letters to put my email in my phone book. As a phone it is okay. Another thing is that when I bought it they didn't tell me they were at the end of their billing period so I got 2 bills with in days of each other.
I think I will look for another brand that takes pictures."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,"WARNING! DONT BUY A PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! VERY CHEAPLY MADE!! Worst phone and service! After a couple of weeks the buttons were not working well, and the battery was not charging well. After it got worse, I called the company and just missed the 30 day return policy. However, they did send a new phone after much complaining. After a month or so this new phone has the same problems. Bad sound, buttons dont work, and doesnt charge well. I am just going to throw it away and eat the money."
B01DRV2BBY,leftlane1,5,"Used by my 93 year old father.
Love it. He has it connected with Great star, He fell and was able to call for help. They GPS'd him, found him and got him the help he needed"
B01DRV2BBY,Michael L. Elterman,5,"Answering a call is as easy as opening the phone and disconnecting is just as easy, close the phone. My father doesn't text and if that were important, I would not purchase this phone. Does not have reminders from phone but you can call Greatcall and set up what you need. Otherwise, phone is great."
B01DRV2BBY,The Bear,5,Great easy to use phone. Keys are easy to read and the 5 star feature is good knowing that help is just a button push away. Setup was easy even to someone not familiar with cell phones. Loved the magnifying feature!
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,3,"Big numbers are good. Phone: Heavy. Clunky. Game feature worthless. Camera quality marginal. Magnifier of limited value.
Verizon has dead-spot in my area. That Jitterbug is on Verizon Network should have been clearly stated. Vibrate or Ring Tones cannot be used simultaneously.Volume button on side phone is easy to hit inadvertently. Wish I had purchased earlier, simpler Jitterbug."
B01DRV2BBY,Frank F.,5,"I have no dislikes at all. I am 69 yrs old for someone like me it has just what i need for my lifestyle, no bells or whistles but just good reliability, loudness, big numbers,easy to use, small size flip phone, it has been the best phone i have had and i have had several."
B01DRV2BBY,Drlechien,4,I bought this Jitterbug after looking at other simple flip phones because I thought that it was the best for me.I had a smart phone for over 3 years and didn't use it enough to warrant the cost.This phone is just what I need so my family can get a hold of me when needed and I can get in touch with medical help when I need it ( the red button ) since I am having some heart problems. I feel much safer since I got this phone and carry it with me all the time. I have already talked to other people my age who are also interested in this phone and recomended it to them.
B01DRV2BBY,Edward Anderson,2,"Sometimes it works, often not. Not a very reliable phone for elders who live alone. Bought two and neither is dependable. Don't throw away your money."
B01DRV2BBY,Linda Cave,5,"I like that it is only a cell phone and not a smart phone with all the apps. It is light weight, which I like not heavy like a smart phone is. I use it when I go out, so that my husband can call me, if he thinks of something else for me to buy."
B01DRV2BBY,Weary Shopper,1,Efficient easy to read phone design is overshadowed by its delayed response when pressing keys. The delay is so great the product is being returned and the Great Call Network will be replaced because it is not such a great network for calls.
B01DRV2BBY,Sharon Newell,5,I bought this phone for my elderly father in law. He could no longer hear with his other cell phone. I ordered this from Greatcall. They were easy to deal with and friendly. The phone works fine and he likes it. He can hear his phone calls again.
B01DRV2BBY,g8rsrgr8r,5,Great customer service and the phone works well for elderly technophobes. Offers many optional services that seem like they will be useful in the future as my parents get older and become less independent.
B01DRV2BBY,OHeidi,1,"Horrible phone, not good for seniors especially! Not very loud at all, ringer or speaker for phone use. Not user friendly at all. Don't waste your money, a normal cell phone is easier. The only pro is bigger icons on the screen, which you can switch to on a regular cell phone, so not really a pro."
B01DRV2BBY,NStab2017,5,"This phone has all the essential features for people who want and need the basics. There instructions are easy to understand. It is easy to navigate through the screens and locate the features that you want or need at the moment. Also, there are many options for plan choice and additional services that can be added a-la-carte."
B01DRV2BBY,SandyB,5,I use the speaker as I can barely hear a phone without it. I like the phone. I am still learning how to use it. I have had a smart phone for a long time. So the learning is slower plus I am getting older. I love the phone. I would recommend it to anyone who needed a phone that was economical.
B01DRV2BBY,Kindle Customer,1,This phone is good for the user but the person getting the call cannot understand a thing being said to them on the other end. The WORSE RECEPTIUON SOUND QUALITY I have EVER WITNESSED. Very frustrating for both ends when you can't understand each other. This phone was returned and we are going back to Consumer Cellular (recommended by AARP) and getting their flip phone!
B01DRV2BBY,B. Teitell,1,"this phone may be ok but you can not return phone through great call without the biggest hassle. Had my 92 year old mom in tears. .do not buy this for your mom or elderly father, have to wait so long on hold, so upset great call is so"
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara A. Keim,3,Easy but not that easy for a 95 year old. Doesn't always ring which I can't understand. Like this morning we are both sitting at the table and we got a message that we had a missed call but there was no phone ringing. This has happened before. I can't blame him because I am sitting right there too. It took a long time to train him and sometimes he bumps the red button accidentally and someone has always answered so that is good.
B01DRV2BBY,Brigitta M. Belviso,5,"I absolutely love my Great Call flip Phone. I am 85 and find it very easy to use and I especially like the 5 star feature in an emergency . It is rechargeable and you can decide the monthly cost , by buying how many minutes a month you need."
B01DRV2BBY,Judy C. Landrum,4,"We bought this for our former neighbor who is 89. She has never used anything like this before. So far she has been able to understand and use the calling feature and use the few contacts she has. She just wants to do the very basics. We wanted it for her safety,"
B01DRV2BBY,S. Ezell,5,"I ordered this phone for my husband that hates technology. After I set it up for him, he has not had any problem in using this phone and carries it with him whenever he goes out. It was extremely easy to set up, however I do recommend going online to add contacts. The menus are simple and it is very easy to use. The big buttons and screen are a plus. Saw their ad in AARP magazine and it is everything they say it is."
B01DRV2BBY,Marjorie Jackson,5,I ordered this phone for my 93 year old Father who is still very active and it has been wonderful.The reception and clarity of all phone calls has been a real lifesaver in helping me keep track of him while he is outside the house.I would highly recommend this phone from the purchasing through the phone setup process it was very easy and stress free.
B01DRV2BBY,Alan D. Walker,5,"The phone is first rate, but I have trouble getting on line to view my account. I believe I gave a valid password but it seems not to be accepted. If i continue to have trouble I'd prefer to get statements on paper. Also, it appears that I'm on a 400 minute monthly use. I expressly ordered a 200 minute per month use, which is adequate for my needs. Alan Walker Acct. no. 3179436"
B01DRV2BBY,Gordon H. Hawkins,5,"I find the Jitterbug and the Great Call service reps topnotch. I have no need for a so called ""smart phone"", so the Jitterbug is perfect for me. Large numbers and an easy to use ""yes or no"" decision to make. Love the camera and the ability to load my phone numbers on my Great Call account page."
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara,5,"Just activated the flip phone for my 87 year old mother. She loves the large numbers and easy notification of missed voicemail and/or call. The only feature she uses is the phone book, but it is easy for her to find the person's name, and is now getting used to the ""speed dial"" number for the people she calls everyday. At any time, you can open the flip phone, push the one/two digit number and hit YES and it places the call. Very easy."
B01DRV2BBY,rondon47,5,"The phone is easy to use, big buttons, and it asks you at each step and mode what you want to do and you answer yes or no to the questions. The 5Star button, if you have that service, is easy to push accidentally. Otherwise, it seems to be a very good phone and phone service."
B01DRV2BBY,David L. Pruitt,5,"purchased for my 94 year old father. number 1 best feature: Largest display i could find.
Father struggles with any technology. not sure the menu's could be any simpler. Works as good as any device he has used with his hearing aids."
B01DRV2BBY,Dorothy,2,"You are unable to transfer information, contacts etc from your old phone! You must type in all contacts. You also have to scroll the entire contact list to get to what number you are looking for, my husband hates this phone and I don't blame him. Sorry"
B01DRV2BBY,Amy H.,5,"Purchased this phone for my elderly mother. She did NOT want a cell phone/plan and did not like the touch screen smart phones or tiny buttons on other phones. Too hard to read and use. Did not need all the ""bells and whistles."" Found the Jitterbug advertised in a magazine and I bought it for her for her birthday. Easy to use, big buttons, and keeps her connected should her home land line go down.
Excellent purchase and the company really seems to stand behind their product."
B01DRV2BBY,OneGalsOpinion,3,"UPDATE 10/21/2016:
The 1st phone started to intermittently function like it was muted. No sound from the Jitterbug but the person on the other end could be heard. I called Great Call and they have not heard of this problem.They sent another phone and in less than a week, it is having the same problem. I see that 2 other reviewers have had this problem and one was told to turn the phone off and back on which solved his problem until it happened again.
The phone should have a lanyard or case, an option to block/disable text messages, less expensive minutes.
I am subtracting 1 star because a phone for seniors should be simple which it is but also reliable which it is not.

I purchased this directly from Great Call to replace a Jitterbug 5 that had stopped working after 1 year. Even with help from Great Call (escalated to 2nd lever of support) it took a long time to get the phone activated. All contacts and minutes carried over successfully.
One of the things liked about the former phone was the optional lanyard.This option is no longer available on the Jitterbug Flip and per the company there are no current plans for adding such. I have spent hours looking for a lanyard or a case to which I could attach a lanyard. This is an important feature for seniors or anyone with motor issues. I finally found a YouTube video that explained how to use the speaker holes on the case back of a different phone. The speaker holes of the Jitterbug Flip are tiny and will not accept a lanyard but will accommodate nylon thread to make a loop for attaching a lanyard.. I don't believe this will void the warranty. Don't know if it affects the sound quality
I have to get this resolved before it goes to the person who will ultimately use it. I would appreciate any other ideas for lanyards or cases for this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,Nice size to the screen and numbers are so easy to see and the large buttons work better for a person with large or shaky fingers. I have been using an android and miss the one tap to write but I will get used to this. I have had flip phones before and do appreciate the ability to close the unit and protect myself from ending up with weird things happening. The older I get the more simple I like things in my life.
B01DRV2BBY,Harry S,5,"My quest was to get some semblance of a smart phone focused toward geriatrics whereby the GreatCall Jitterbug flip phone more than fit the bill. It's comfortable to hold, very easy to use, and in affect has texting, photo and voice-call activation capability. I opted to include the one-button 5Star emergency call function for obvious reasons. Overall, I'm very pleased with the device and GreatCall's exemplary customer service."
B01DRV2BBY,Joan L. Turner,5,My 81 year old husband loves this cell phone. He says phones are to used to talk not write! lol
B01DRV2BBY,Kamala,1,What a piece of junk. I called tech support on numerous occasions because one thing or another stopped working. They even replaced one. I got this for my mom and at first thought it was because she couldn't use it properly. But it actually didn't work most of the time.
B01DRV2BBY,Spectacular Shopper,4,"I like my Jitterbug very much. It is the right size and the screen is wonderful. Going from a smart phone it took some time for me to adjust to the simplicity of it. I no longer needed all the bells and whistles of a smart phone and needed to save some money. Mission accomplished on both counts.

On the down side, sometimes the buttons are hard to press and need pressing twice."
B01DRV2BBY,Michael and Faith,5,"Best cell phone ever had..extremely user friendly..and the one button concierge feature worth its
weight in gold..forget that smart phone nonsense which is a big con to make money off you by advertising
sales and selling you apps and etc..
Thanks Jitterbug my red flip I will never give up !!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Sara Kirchhoff,1,Can someone enlighten me on how this phone can be so highly rated when I am thru only a few pages of reviews and I have 4 likes and 25 dislikes? I was contemplating this phone for my husband because of how highly rated it is in several cites for cell phones for seniors. The only way I could submit this was I had to give it a rating.
B01DRV2BBY,BV,2,My mother is 91 and for a year now has been ok with phone...Only downside is I wish the volume was louder. Half the time she never hears the phone. Also there is no BLOCK number. My mom gets calls all the time. It scares me...
B01DRV2BBY,Dorothy A. Benoit,4,It is my first cellphone and it works well for an older person. I am 80 and cannot see well. It has done all I had hoped it would do. I would buy another. I would like to have a way to block numbers.
B01DRV2BBY,Glenn W. Ehrlich,5,"I needed a phone for my elderly mother with big buttons, solid construction, and most importantly, an easy to use UI, because she is very technophobic. The UI is very simple and very elegant and she has even figured out how to use some features on her own. The owner's manual and quick start guide (especially) have nice, large, clear print for her to read. I also like that the buttons are very, very big, because manual dexterity is an issue for her hands and the simple keyboard & large buttons are easy for her to use. In addition to the easy and elegant UI, the screen has a minimum of information on it and what it does is clear and in large print. I am extremely pleased with this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,John,4,"I appreciate the simplicity of this type of fun. As a prisoner to the iPhone, its refreshing to eliminate the distractions and just have a phone with very basic texting ability. I love not having access to the internet, its healthy to get away from all of that stuff instead of drag around in your pocket where-ever you go. The Jitterbug is a great flip phone, if you remember that's what it is, a basic flip phone."
B01DRV2BBY,SANDRA BRADLEY,5,"I love it, it is the best and easiest phone to program and find what you want.can't say much for picture quality but giving up for ease of use would have liked a red one but Best BUY only had grey. one more time i love it ,loud ring had a dial tone just like a land line.."
B01DRV2BBY,txstar,5,This phone was purchased for my 92 year old father and he finally has a phone that he can use. It's easy to use and the larger buttons and onscreen assistance is readable and simple.
B01DRV2BBY,JLH,5,"After struggling with a touch screen she couldnât use properly and poor connection problems from a cheap carrier, my mother has a phone she can use. And the call stays connected. The whole family is so happy because itâs now so easy to call her and receive her calls. Definitely a great service for those tech challenged seniors."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"PURCHASED FOR OUR MOTHER WHO IS 90 YEARS OLD AND NEEDED A PHONE THAT WAS EASY TO OPERATE, AND THIS IS THE ONE, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO OTHERS!! SO FAR IT WORKS AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS PHONE AND IS MUCH EASIER TO OPERATE FOR HER."
B01DRV2BBY,samsingndans,4,"We've only been using this phone for two weeks. It is for out 95 year old father. We wanted something simple and clear. Although the learning curve is greater for older people, generally, he seems to be learning how to use it. We have not introduced him to the voice command yet. ...baby steps...
Wanted a bright color (red) so it would be easier for him to find it if lost or misplaced. I and I hope he, likes the dial tone that you hear upon opening the flip phone. This is like an old house phone. We'll see how he's doing with this phone in a few weeks or months."
B01DRV2BBY,Rose H.,4,Easy to use with large buttons and easy to program with the yes and no and up and down arrow navigation buttons. Calls out and in had clear sound quality and I especially enjoy the built in games and the bright flashlight when you flip open the phone and press the button on the side. The 5* button make it easy to get help if you need it by hitting just that button. They know automatically your location and can call 911 for you or get you an ambulance. Nice phone for the price.
B01DRV2BBY,eyeread,5,"The Jitterbug Flip phone ads are directed towards older phone users, but I think it is a great phone for any age. Out of the box, the Jitterbug Flip phone is easy to set up. Using the ""Yes"" and ""No"" buttons on the Jitterbug makes the menu very easy to navigate, making the process of each feature easy to complete. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the photos I took with the Jitterbug Flip phone in comparison to a Verizon flip phone I had a few years ago. The Jitterbug Flip phone produced crisp, clear photos with its easy to operate camera. If you are looking for an easy to understand, simple to operate phone, you'll love the Jitterbug Flip phone, as much as I do."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"Good phone for this senior. Easy to read and hear and even I could figure out all the different things it can do. Texting is not something I like to do (arthritis causes stiff fingers) and this phone is not as simple to text as the more costly smart phones. I can text when I must, call & receive calls and take and send pictures. I don't need more than that and this phone is priced right and the monthly cost is minimal compared to other phones. I like it."
B01DRV2BBY,Beverly Duzenack,4,"So far I like it. It is easy to read, to navigate and the yes and no is simple. Only use the phone when traveling or going to town so is not on 24/7. So far most of my issues have been solved and the waiting time is reasonable. We will see in another 6 months."
B01DRV2BBY,Susan C. Levine,4,"This is a simple no frills phone. I bought it directly from Great call and it arrived ready to set up. Very easy. I send some texts, and it is much slower without a keypad, but it works. I rarely used my iPhone and got tired of the cost. This is so much cheaper, no contract, good customer service so far. If you want a fancy phone this is not it. But, for safety and basic phone needs, this works well."
B01DRV2BBY,Alexander Lucard,4,"I picked this up for my father to use who broke his cell phone on his last trip to Washington DC this summer. He only uses it for emergencies, like when he travels to see me or to have in his car in the winter (he's in Minnesota) in case of a bad snow fall or car accident. This means he doesn't need a phone to surf the web, check email, or the like. He uses a cell phone like it's 2005 and that's fine because that's all he needs. Which is what made the Jitterbug so great for his particular needs. He's a bit anachronistic when it comes to technology, so having a simply flip phone with easy to read numbers is just what he needed. Push buttons instead of a touch screen was also right up his alley. The plans for the Jitterbug are cheap and so we're not paying fifty dollars a month for minutes he will never use. We haven't had to use the emergency button but it's good to have. One button to reach emergency services is better than having to press three. It's a simple easy to use phone for seniors who just want something in case of an emergency or their land line goes out."
B01DRV2BBY,DIYer Dave,5,To me the phone has been direct and simple to use. I have had no problems with it since I purchased about 4 months ago. Batter life has been very good.
B01DRV2BBY,mary,5,perfect phone -easy to use-not complicated! 5 star is great in case of need. working in hospital- all shifts- feel secure! easy to use! meets all my needs! get it! you will not be sorry! (various packages to choice from)
B01DRV2BBY,L. Roth,4,"This is a phone intended to provide basic functionality with an easy to use interface, large buttons, and large screen. It's aimed at those who just want a phone with one or two extras, not a hand held computer.

It comes ready to go out of the box, already charged. Just make sure it's compatible with the network in your area, and it should be fine."
B01DRV2BBY,Thomas F.,1,"After reading most reviews I decided the best course of action is to go.with a proven winner, that being Tracphone.
Thanks to all reviewers, you do make a difference and most companies pay attention."
B01DRV2BBY,Nancy Clouse,5,"The buttons are large and everything is very simple either yes you want to or no you don't want to. The cradle is great because it doesn't wear out a usb charging port on the phone. I was surprised to learn I had to go online or call to update and delete phone numbers. My husband doesn't go online, so that could be an issue for someone. The voice quality isn't the best, but it's understandable."
B01DRV2BBY,janniesue,5,"I purchased this phone for my mother for its simplicity and large numbers and words. Also after getting this phone, she was able to cancel her landline and be free of that expense."
B01DRV2BBY,Vaboy,5,Has given me much needed independence. I have macular degeneration and was unable to make calls when I was by myself. The voice dial feature gave me back my independence.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,phone is nice and load buttons are big and I would have given it a 5 star if it was not for the location of the volume buttons. All phone put the buttons on the side of the phone and when one pulls the phone out of the case it's in you can't help the fact you are pushing on the buttons and then lowering the volume which is the main reason for buying the phone. Volume buttons should be under the cover and no buttons should be on the outside.
B01DRV2BBY,Steph P.,5,"Super simple for my 70 year old Mother, now if I can just get her to continue to use it steady. Excellent customer service, they definitely know their customer base."
B01DRV2BBY,marie westermann,5,Easy to set up and easy to use- especially for people not used to technology
B01DRV2BBY,Dennis Koffer,5,"Amazing customer service. Tech support arranged for 3-way conference call to help my 99 year old mother when the phone failed,They then sent her a replacement, and transferred all 75 of her contacts to the new phone. The set up for the new phone was so easy she did it herself. Support has been available promptly even on Sunday. Being able to edit the phone book on line has been a plus for me as I live 300 miles away."
B01DRV2BBY,Richard Conner,5,I have only had the phone for a short time . I like the size of the screens and number pad. Also the easy way to make calls and use the other parts of the phone. As I am a senior citizen it works great for me I am very satisfied at this time.
B01DRV2BBY,Brian Cochran,2,"I purchased this phone for my 92-yr-old mother about a year ago, when her previous flip phone, from t-mobile, stopped working well. I used the phone myself for about a week and found it to be an decent basic flip phone. My mother learned how to use it easily, but she has also been able to learn how to use other inexpensive flip phones easily in the past. There are really 3 problems with the phone: (1) Sound quality is just okay, and the loudness, even at the highest setting, is not particularly loud. (It's okay for me, but not for an average senior.) This is really not a ""special phone for seniors"" as far as sound quality goes. Also the speakerphone feature is quite poor (again, the sound quality). (2) The call loudness is easy for my mother to change inadvertently during the call. (It starts at high, then shifts to medium and she can't hear me.) In other words, the location of the volume buttons is really a poor design for seniors. (3) The sound quality has gotten worse over the course of the yearâ¦ imagine that, a phone for the elderly that doesnât age well. ;)

In my experience, the Jitterbug is an avg-to low quality flip phone with a slightly dumbed down user interface and big keys on the keyboard. There is nothing else special about it as a phone for seniors, unless you use the emergency alert services. A disappointment overall."
B01DRV2BBY,Rita S. Padden,5,"I purchased the phone because I wanted a phone basically just to make and receive calls. My husband suffered a stroke and cannot ""work"" anything very complicated. This works well for just a basic phone. One neat thing I had it programmed by my audiologist so I can answer the phone through the hearing aids remote hanging around my neck. Very easy to use jitterbug and sound quality very good. I can use it without my hearing aids on."
B01DRV2BBY,gaintman,4,"Very pleasantly surprised to learn I can use Lyft ride service without needing a smart phone. a BIG bonus. do not understand why unit will tell me i have 1 new text message when in fact I do not. was never going to get another cell phone but when my late wife became terminal, it became necessary. this flip phone completely fills the bill."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"This is a great, simple phone for seniors. I got it for my 95-year old mother, who has severe macular degeneration, to use in emergency situations. She is able to see the large buttons with relative ease compared to her previous phone. The red 5-star button that she can push to get help gives me peace of mind."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"I PURCHASED MY JITTERBUG DIRECT FROM GREAT CALL.. I CAN ONLY RATE MY JITTERBUG WITH A TRIPLE 5 STAR RATING.
ASOLUTELY THE BEST CELL PHONE I EVER OWNED.. THE PHONE DID TELL ME IT DID NOT WORK WITH A USB CABLE TO UP LOAD
PHOTOS TO MY COMPUTER**BUT IT DOES*** I HAVE UP LOADED SEVERAL PHOTOS TO MY COMPUTER
AGAIN I COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPY WITH MY JITTERBUG****GREAT PHONE***
BILL TARRANT, ALTON, IL"
B01DRV2BBY,Shursts59,5,"This phone has been wonderful for my mother. She suffered a stroke and has weakness on the left side, unable to open a regular flip phone easily or fast enough, and not quite able to grasp learning a touch screen smart phone! I highly recommend this phone for elderly people... simple YES and NO buttons make it easy for my mom to understand. Thank you jitterbug!!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jean,4,I like this phone very much. It would not charge on the cradle and the charge plug in went out a mouth later. These things happen. The customer service people are excellent and they are sending me a new charge cable.
B01DRV2BBY,deborah allison,5,"I purchased two of these phones for my dad and my uncle. They both love the sound quality, the bigger, easy to see buttons and the easy navigation through the menu options."
B01DRV2BBY,Ballpark,5,"The Jitterbug Flip phone gives me just what I need. It's very easy to use, help is just a phone call away, I take it with me each time I leave home and it gives me confidence in case of an emergency."
B01DRV2BBY,JIM BALFE,5,I purchased the Jitterbug for my mom. She loves it!! The red color is easy to find in her purse. It is extremely easy to use with the large buttons and simple screen. Best of all the personal service. They helped us set everything up.
B01DRV2BBY,Giftgiver,5,Not a better phone anywhere for those with poor vision and hearing. Easy to use also. Only thing I wish I had is the ability to load a feew APPS.
B01DRV2BBY,Ann Browning,5,"I had a smartphone which was complicated but in 2 yrs, I learned it but when I saw the Jitterbug for seniors; and really love the big buttons it's big text; It takes way less time, I do all the rest on tablet or laptop. it's size makes it possible to carry it and charge card in my pocket. No need for a big heavy purse."
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara Patton,5,Easy yes or no choices with the topic highlighted makes this phone extremely easy to use.
B01DRV2BBY,James Chance,5,"The phone is everything I expected, and is just what I wanted. I tried the Jitterbug smart phone and soon discovered that it was smarter than I was. Didn't like the thing. Great Call was very helpful in exchanging it for the flip phone. I now am a happy customer."
B01DRV2BBY,Karolina Ken,5,"My wife's cell phone was getting pretty old and not always dependable. I did some research and determined that the Jitterbug Flip was the right choice. Obviously, it operates differently from her previous phone, but she is getting more comfortable with it every day. the large viewing screen, numbers, and buttons has been a real find. Was a little disappointed that AT&T does not provide a network for this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,FunnyBubbie3,4,"I purchased this as an update for the previous version for my 95 yr old Mom. The biggest drawback is the placement of the volume buttons. Silver buttons on silver not good for visually impaired, and on the side where anyone wants to grab the phone causes problems we didn't have before. The added camera, magnifier, flashlight are all good...but hard for Mom to remember how to use. Even the ability to use Voice dialing is hard because you have to go to the phonebook first. I think all these new features are wonderful if your elder can see relatively well. Great Call' s Customer service is top notch 24/7 365. Also the one thinv I love is the 5star button. Once activated, as soln ad the phone is opened the GPS is on. If Mom has a problem ANYWHERE she presses that red button and Grsat Call knows where she is to notify local 911. Peace of mind...worth it!"
B01DRV2BBY,Lonnalee Krans,1,We bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas. She has had a terrible time with it. Now the phone doesn't even take a charge or won't turn on. This would be a terrific phone for her if it worked. Please give us suggestions what we can do with this phone for her.
B01DRV2BBY,Sandy Stambaugh,5,I bought the jitterbug smartphone for my 83yr old mother who has dementia. She could not use this phone even though it is a very user friendly phone. I sent it back and got the flip phone and she has been using it without a problem. Great easy to use phone.
B01DRV2BBY,billwald,5,"for emergency, meeting people, when away from home. It is normally not turned on. I prefer email or land line."
B01DRV2BBY,elaine shearin,5,"Having this phone for my husband had been a big worry off my mind. I now know that no matter where he is, he isn't far from help. It is a very good price for not only having the phone for communication, but the safety factor alone is worth the price. We owned system earlier, but one had to be within a certain area or it didn't not work; several times it didn't work or notified emergency personnel without needing."
B01DRV2BBY,Patricia McConnell,4,I enjoyed using this phone because it was light and fit in my hand. the number on pad were very large which was nice because you did not have to squint to see them.

B01DRV2BBY,C. VanDyke,3,"I bought this Flip Phone phone through GreatCall over a year ago for my fairly deaf father who is 96.

Upsides:
1. the numbers are large.
2. The speaker is loud, when you use it instead of the handset.
3. The menu navigation is pretty straightforward for old people without a lot of confusion, but there are still seniors who will get confused using it. Answer the questions yes or no and the phone does what you want it to do. ""Do you want to call this number? >YES."" That kind of menu.

Downsides:
1. You can't block numbers on this flip phone. Old people are a big target for phone scams. My dad gets bogus telemarketing calls all the time and I can't block the numbers to prevent repeat calls. Thankfully, my next comment comes into play so he never answers the phone ...
2. Why? The ringer isn't very loud. My dad can't hear it even when it's in his pocket, and it's set as loud as it will go. On top of that, you can't set the ringer to loud AND vibrate, which would be very helpful. The ringer is either on some volume OR off with vibrate only.
3. For my father, even with hearing aids, the handset is not loud enough. Hence, we use the speaker a lot.
4. The charging dock bit the dust in less than one year."
B01DRV2BBY,M. Peterson,1,"This phone made by Alcatel is junk compared to the older Samsung flip. We upgraded when our battery went dead and were unable to replace so we thought it would be better to upgrade the phone. What a mistake. First we had all kinds of trouble because the phone would not activate even though we had to go by a window, then go to the front yard then the backyard. Hours with customer service with no help, we had to mail it in and have them activate it then send it back, more hassles and no phone. Finally we got the phone back and found that it would go dead for no reason at all. Again went through customer service, she had me take the back off and remove the battery then replace it. This is the only way we can make the phone work. If you need it in an emergency you are stuck out of luck until you remove the battery again. We were told not to do that but to return the phone for a replacement, for what another junky Alcatel. Not again. We are going to look at other carriers that have a reliable phone."
B01DRV2BBY,JJ,5,"Jitterbug Flip phone has Large Keys and SIMPLE operation. It is just great for seniors or non-techie persons. Price is most reasonable. Texting is available IF the user wants it. With Large clear menus , it's EASY to operate with YES and NO buttons! Voice dial service is free!"
B01DRV2BBY,Carmen,1,"Great Calls doesn't tell people the truth when they activate this phone. They advertise affordable monthly plans, but don't tell you that they charge you for INCOMING calls as well as OUTGOING. My 89 year old mother only has the phone for emergency calls and talking with family members. Her first bill came (on a $33 a month plan) and it was $250! They charged her for every INCOMING and OUTGOING call!!! This also means that any solicitation calls she got, Great Calls charged her for!!!!!. When I called to tried to find out why the bill was so high, they told me my mother would have to go on-line and print out her call usage and identify every phone number on there....all 276 calls!!! We cancelled the next day."
B01DRV2BBY,Zelda's stuff,1,"My 77 year old mother has this phone and has nothing but problems. The buttons on the sides of the phone are right where your hand/fingers would go to hold the phone up to your ear when talking to someone. The ringer mysteriously gets turned off all the time. The menu keys are so slow to respond it reminds me of when the internet was dial-up. It could be my mother not knowing how to use it, by both I and my sister have tried to turn on the ""jingle"" as they call the ringer, and it just goes off again. Is it my mom's thumb grasping the phone as she holds it?

I don't know, but it's no good. I do not recommend. I love the idea of the large letters but it still has too many un-needed features like background color, etc. Seniors don't want that option...do they? Time for another company to re-invent the wheel here. A wheel for seniors."
B01DRV2BBY,JRS,1,"I bought this phone a year ago directly from âJitterbugâ/GreatCall for $99 plus a $30 activation fee. My mom is in her 70s and I just needed her to have something for emergencies. The cheapest plan they have is something like $25 per month with fees but it was worth my piece of mind. She has had flip phones in the past so I figured this one would be no problem. I even programmed her friendsâ numbers into it. SHE HATED IT. I paid for the service for a year before finally giving up. She couldnât get it to turn on, it never worked right and it wouldnât hold a charge. Honestly, I heard nothing but complaints from her for the entire time she had this phone.

For Christmas I gave her my old iPhone 7 Plus. She looooves it. I honestly didnât think she could figure out a smart phone, which is why I gave her the Jitterbug Flip. What a waste of time, energy and money.

She used the Jitterbug MAYBE a total of 30 minutes for the ENTIRE YEAR!!!

The worst part of this is that when I called to cancel the service today the rep was like âToo bad your service month just renewed January 10th. I can cancel your service but youâre still paying for it through February 9thâ!!!!

WHY IS IT THAT EVERY OTHER COMPANY IN THE WORLD CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRO-RATE A CANCELLATION?!!â Good job getting an extra $20 out of me, GreatCall. Maybe youâd like to step into the 21st century with the rest of us?"
B01DRV2BBY,Frank Candlish,2,"I got a great price for the phone I bought here on Amazon..I made the choice considering the easy use of the phone and idea of a $14.99 monthly charge with no contract..Sounded great!!! But....when I got the phone and called for the activation, I learned the company adds a ""service fee"" on top of the monthly charge which came to roughly $31.40 a month. Additionally the phone has camera and texting capabilities..Great!!!! But...every time you text, it costs $0.10 for each text you send and receive. Furthermore, for every picture/selfie you take, it will also cost you an additional $0.10 for each photo..I was not pleased about the additional fees,especially the ""service fee"" which doubles the monthly basic fee. This explains the two star rating. However, I did keep the phone and activated it..These additional fees need to be considered when purchasing this phone,especially for those on a limited budget.."
B01DRV2BBY,Veg Traveler,1,I wanted to believe the good reviews because my mom wouldn't stop bugging me to purchase this red flip phone for her. She has bad eyesight and like many older seniors needs to have a cell phone that will work without all the fuss of the internet on the phone. My sister broke down and got it for her and it has been a head ache for the last 6 months. Just imagine that you don't live near the person who needs it and the phone stops working. Then you spend HOURS contacting every neighbor of hers and then more time contacting the seller to send a new chip. Many times it would just ring and she wouldn't hear it. Long story short - Before this red phone I had a walmart smartphone set up with a software that always showed big easy buttons. Then I used bluetooth to transfer her existing contacts. On this red phone all the contacts and numbers will need to be entered manually. The marketing for this phone is great because everyone who hasn't had one thinks it is a great idea. I thought it was. Currently she has no cell and waiting again for a new chip. I'm across the country so not sure if it is a signal related issue or just that the phone breaks easy. I just want to save someone else this headache and worry. Read all the negative reviews before you buy this.
B01DRV2BBY,Mel,5,"I am an retired letter carrier and I love my Jitterbug flip phone by Great Call but the only I had was as an hard of hearing, I could not hear the phone rings and missing some phone calls. Sometime next year, I am planning to Great Call Smartphone."
B01DRV2BBY,tshinn777,1,Had it less than 6 months and it's not working.
B01DRV2BBY,farriersgirl,5,"Love the big screen and numbers. Super easy to use - no ""swiping"". Great reception in areas old phone had none. Typing in the phone numbers list on the computer was great! Easy to download pictures taken with jitterbug to computer. Can't say enough positive things about this phone! BUY IT!"
B01DRV2BBY,Jayd,5,"Still learning how to use. So far, so good...."
B01DRV2BBY,denise hector,5,"Bought it for my 90 year mom,she seems to have no problems with it so far."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Worst costumer service ever product is not user friendly go to Walmart and by a track phone
B01DRV2BBY,Mary Merritt,5,"Love my phone. I do not have time to devote to learning a computer system, which is what the new phones amount to, so this phone is perfect for me - a very busy person, who has a lot more to do than sit on my phone all day."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"I first bought a consumer cellular Envoy and the buttons and numbers were to small as well as the screen, I had a hard time finding anything on the phone. I sent the Envoy back and called Great Calls for the Jitterbug and I am very happy now."
B01DRV2BBY,Betty Freese,5,"We love everything about the phone. When the trac fone quits, I will be purchasing another jitterbug phone. Keep up the good work."
B01DRV2BBY,Charles,5,"I bought my Jitterbug phone primarily for safety - to have a way to communicate if something happens while I'm away from my apartment. I'm 77.

I've used it, some, mostly to call family members when I'm ""back home"" visiting. and have had no problems..

Fortunately, I haven't had an emergency while away from my apartment, but, it's comforting to know I have it ""just in case!""."
B01DRV2BBY,JAWONNA PINELL,5,"WHAT SENIOR CITIZENS NEED IS LOUDER
RINGERS. THEY CAND NOT HEAR THEM WHEN YOU CALL THEM. THEY NEED LOUDER AND MORE RING OPTIONS!!!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Betty,5,Great phone with big buttons and large numbers. Perfect for seniors. Easy to use phone for those who only want to make and receive calls. My husband is very pleased with the Jitterbug flip phone. I want to add that their customer service is excellent!
B01DRV2BBY,Elhomic,5,"I like the bigger, brightly colored screen. The Long lasting battery. 5Star Button, bigger buttons. Built in camera with flash. Easy to find powerful speaker. The reading magnifier with LED flash light makes it easy to see and read in a dim light. This camera is so good for older people because of all the features and benefits. I highly recomend it."
B01DRV2BBY,Bobby,1,"I am not buying this phone. My mom needs an emergency contact phone if she is out of the house but has to keep her house phone because it opens the lobby door when her service people come. 1000 minutes a month is outrageous for her she won't use that many in 5 years. Soooo, too expensive upfront, I don't trust Verizon in Denver, I have a Verizon account and I have to sit on the lanai to keep from dropping calls when I am there so not even good if she uses it for her LD calls to me every week."
B01DRV2BBY,Harmon Bower,5,"Thank you for making a phone that I can use, very satisfied... Now that says it all"
B01DRV2BBY,Lloyd Carson,5,This phone is fantastic for my 87 year old mother that lives alone. Extremely easy to use; enough volume for her hearing aids; large buttons; easy to read display; quick friendly response from the alert service; and very reasonable cost.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,This phone is AWESOME! I love the size of the numbers and how sleek and pretty it is. I also was very pleasantly surprised by the docking station that came with it and the car charger that was sent to me in the mail. The phone service via Great Call is also incredible. They helped me to set up my phone and are so nice to talk to. Would strongly recommend both phone and carrier.
B01DRV2BBY,Pollywolly,5,"I love my Jitterbug, it's very well made for seniors!! I highly recommend it to all my senior friends!! Thank you Great Call!!"
B01DRV2BBY,Pi,4,"Shutterfly customer service states that photos cannot be transferred from the computer to the Flip phone.
Probably the only feature not on the phone."
B01DRV2BBY,charles higler,5,"So far, it is a perfect solution for simply making and receiving phone calls, which is all I want. The speakers seem to be a little raspy, but the sound is nice and loud. My wife has a smart phone and wishes she would have bought a Jitterbug!"
B01DRV2BBY,Lee Hargrave,5,"This is a sturdy, high-quality device that is perfect for the person with vision issues and chronic health needs. It is appealing and handsomely designed."
B01DRV2BBY,Harold E. Curtisjr,5,"I luv the new JitterBug,but Verizon needs better coverage--The closest tower is 15 miles away and down in a hole."
B01DRV2BBY,Connie Fabrizio,1,The volume buttons are in the side of the phone. Every time he grabs the phone he lowers the ring. And the ring is not loud enough to begin with. Why canât aomeibe just make a simple phone with no frills! Not easy to use
B01DRV2BBY,johnny bravo,5,customer service fantastic
B01DRV2BBY,LayKoon Tan,4,"It took me a while to get used to the features of this phone since I have been using an iPhone for a few years now. At first, I found it challenging when it came to texting (having to press a button repeatedly to get a letter to show up). And going from capital letters to small caps to numbers and exclamation marks. I kept referring to the manual but the instructions are all there. It's just a matter of getting used to it through repetition.
Nice that it has a camera though the resolution is not that great, but at least there is a camera.
I like the bright flashlight and how easy it is to turn it on. The flashlight button is on the outside of the phone (right above the volume buttons).
If you have the Health & Safety package, you can get help by pressing the 5* button which is below the numbers. In the event you're in an unsafe situation, pressing the 5* button puts you through to an operator right away to ask for help.
The numbers are lit up when you open the phone, and large enough to see clearly.
The phone is equipped with a magnifying glass! And the Speaker button is easy to turn on while you are having a phone conversation.
You can play brain games on the phone if you get bored."
B01DRV2BBY,Lyle S.,4,"large numbers and letters. less apps to wade through.
easy to use. able to hear better.

B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"During hurricane Irma the operators in California were such a help with getting my calls thru to the power company and to spectrum and my family and friends to let them know I was safe. I live in Deland,Fla. Thanks Jitterbug"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,4,"I prefer a smartphone, but I would recommend Jitterbug for people who don't need all the functions a smart phone provides. This phone would be especially good for senior citizens and people with arthritis or other disabilities. It is a good choice for people who want a basic cell phone that is easy to use."
B01DRV2BBY,Nancy Chizek,5,"This phone is perfect for people of our age. It is easy to read, operate and hear through. Have tried 3 other flip phones in the past but this is
the best along with the no contract feature and low cost."
B01DRV2BBY,John Vergot,5,this phone is fantastic easy to use great clarity on send and receive. the only problem I'm having is marring it to my new 2016 ford focus.
B01DRV2BBY,Lenore Rosenblum,5,I like the larger numbers and the convenience of having everything at my fingertips especially the button for calling for a Lyft ride. I also like the games they have posted. Am very happy with my jitterbug.
B01DRV2BBY,sonny sparks,5,"The phone was a gift and I have had zero problems with it. I have had several phones in the past three years with no success. Two of the company's I had was a real bitch communication with them. One was a real problem but since I'm a really nice guy I will let it go. Thanks for having such a quality product.

Orville s. Sparks"
B01DRV2BBY,Hikick51,4,"I liked the simplicity and clarity of its use, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was difficult to do email, etc."
B01DRV2BBY,KATHY TYLER,5,"The Jitterbug Flip Phone is perfect for people who do not care about all the bells and whistles of an I-phone. The numbers and letters are large and can be easily seen. I have had other phones in years past, but this one is by far the best for my needs. Highly recommend it."
B01DRV2BBY,crazywop,5,Like the size of the buttons. Much easier to use. Phone takes a bit longer to power on.
B01DRV2BBY,Picbsu,5,Great device. Easy as it gets for my elderly father in law to operate.
B01DRV2BBY,Arthur Macdonald,4,"As a recent subscriber, I'm pleased with this device so far. The many essential functions are satisfied by pressing either 'YES' or 'NO' buttons. The speaker phone is quite handy. Dropped calls/no network service are unlikely, due to a contracted, robust (Verizon) cell tower network nationwide. Despite a bit of familiarization yet to go, this mid-eighties active senior does recommend the product."
B01DRV2BBY,Barb adkins,5,great customer service. My mother loves the phone. Its so easy to use. Love the network it runs off of.
B01DRV2BBY,Paul D. Siverling,4,"Like size of phone,large digits, Donât like the fact that there is no way to prevent receiving text messages."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"Perfect easy to use phone for someone who simply wants to be able to make and receive phone calls.
Excellent, polite customer service."
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"I love the 5* button and the large keys. Some other functions have taken longer to get used to, but I am sure I will learn."
B01DRV2BBY,Nadine W. Larson,5,Highly affordable. Easy to use.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,I got this for my 86 year old father. It is easy to use and the ring is loud and he can hear well on it. It has worked out well for him.
B01DRV2BBY,Frank A,4,I bought it for my mother who is 90 years old and is not teck savvy. It was a good quality product and very easy to use for senior citizens.
B01DRV2BBY,patricia ambrose,5,"My husband (76) LOVES this phone.....He is not at all computer savay but has absolutely NO trouble using this. He set it up himself and has had ""proud"" moments trying all the things it has to offer ie: taking pictures, texting, etc. I would recomment this phone to anyone and when something goes wrong with my phone, I plan on getting one of these for myself!"
B01DRV2BBY,dennis mitchell,1,Horrible sound. Slow to start. Not impressed.
B01DRV2BBY,sharon,2,mine just died while charging and I have no phone--GreatCall is not accessible at 7:00 pm on line if I have an emergency just too bad.. Can't trust the product..

B01DRV2BBY,honestly,2,Everything works on phone as advertised except the time on display is incorrect. The issue has not been resolved for the 3 months since purchasing. The incorrect time is confusing for my elderly and challenged parents. Beware.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,LOVE THE PHONE EASY TO UNDERSTAND WITH LOTS OF HELPFUL FEATURES I FEEL SAFE KNOWING THAT IF I AM OUT AND ANYTHING GOES WRONG HELP IS ONLY ONE CLICK AWAY
B01DRV2BBY,Barbara Lewis,3,The Jitterbug Flip has large numbers and screen size. It allows me to not be concerned about accidental calls due to the flip.Clarity in dialing is also a plus/
B01DRV2BBY,Eddie,5,The best and easiest to use cell phone out there!
B01DRV2BBY,Donald S. Kent,5,This is our second Jitterbug Flip and it meets our needs competently and efficiently. This new version has features that make it very easy to use. A great phone at a fair price.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"I can't say enough good things about this flip phone - Both my wife and I each have one. The five star button gives us peace of mind and the phone is super easy to operate. We are both elderly and the big screen, large buttons, simple operation, and good volume are much appreciated. Not having to deal with a long term contract is another plus and the rates are very reasonable."
B01DRV2BBY,Dottie Plautz,5,it is so easy to use and the numbers are nice and big to see! I finally am using a cell phone!!
B01DRV2BBY,Lady J,5,Great phone for seniors easy to use. The Big num.& letters easy to see. Got this phone for my Brother in nursing home he lovers his phone. Customer Service is very friendly and answers all questions.
B01DRV2BBY,nancy s.,5,"Do not get this phone.I JUST READ the long review of the lady having so much trouble getting anything resolved on the phone from Jitterbug.
Believe me,been there, done that! I SYMPATHIZE! Also ,do not expect to send pic to Facebook. They dis continued that feature soon after I got my phone__with no warning. You. May wonder why I stay. With them--reasonable rates!"
B01DRV2BBY,SAFeiner,5,I love the large print on the keys and ease of using it. I can't think of any thing I don't like.

."
B01DRV2BBY,Deborah Williams,2,I loved my previous flip phone. This one is very slow to activate. It is temperamental . I can't feel as confident in it as I did my old phone. Wish I had it back.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"This phone is exactly what our mother needed, easy to see the numbers, loud volume and simple instructions ! I give it 5 stars!"
B01DRV2BBY,LEP,5,I like it because it is easy to use and I can hear on it.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,"the phone is easy to use it has big numbers, hearing impaired features and speakerphone, the camera is good.i have not tried the assistance features but i am sure they are worth while. i am provided with a business phone so this is my personal phone and i do not use it all that often but when i do use it i am very satisfied"
B01DRV2BBY,Donna Giese,5,Very easy for Dad to use! Big buttons and easy instructions. Don't like the old way of using number buttons to text or add contacts but the use of the phone is worth it for Dad .
B01DRV2BBY,Doug,5,"I live in the mounins where we do not have cell service. We use the Jitterbug on the times we are ""down the Mountain."" It works great for that and using the Verizon service network gives us great reception, even in remote N.CO. and S. Wyoming."
B01DRV2BBY,Jerome R.,5,This is absolutely the best senior flip phone.
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,5,The Jitterbug flip phone is so much easier to use than my previous phone and is less expensive.
B01DRV2BBY,Mimi Hammond,5,"I bought this for my husband who has very poor technical skills. After helping him learn the flip phone features, he seems to be very happy to use this phone."
B01DRV2BBY,Juli A. Pederson,5,"I'm in love with my Jitter Bug. It gives me great peace of mind! I can hear and see very well with this cute little device! It isn't easy getting older, but this phone makes it much more fun!"
B01DRV2BBY,Amazon Customer,1,Not as easy to use as stated for the elderly. Would not recommend for those with memory impairment.
B01DRV2BBY,George Heide,5,This is a great cell phone and it is the best one for seniors like me. It is very easy to use and the sound is great. There are lots of options that can be had if you want them and the prices are very reasonable. I will recommend them to all ( old and young ) Great Call is the best !

B01DRV2BBY,William C. ATKINSON,4,"All the witch said it would be. I am pretty deaf so learned to text in a minute. Would be really good if one could go back over text to edit before sending. Takes reasonable pix, but needs a steady hand. Flashlight is awesome!"

B01DRV2BBY,Diane Mason,5,"This phone is easy to use. My previous phone was difficult when it came to answering calls. Half the time I couldn't answer. I do hate it that I paid a higher price for the Jitterbug than if I had waited a few days. I paid $100, could have paid less a few days later."

B01DRV2BBY,Janette Marie,5,My husband and I are not Smart Phone kind of people. Also we don't get cell reception at our home (dead zone) and only needed a phone that was simple and easy to use. It has all the features we wanted and nothing we didn't. The large buttons are great!

B00PWEN2ZE,AttackOfTheVapors,5,"Not sure if I'm qualified to write a review on a ""tech"" item or not. Up to now, I've used a flip phone and this is the first smart phone I've used. Keep in mind that I'm not a tech saavy senior and my concerns might not coincide with the general public's (younger, more informed people).

I like the fact that this phone has some heft. To me, the weight of it attests to its quality and makes me believe it is a solid product. It feels good in the hand during use and, even with a Ringke case, it's not too bulky to be comfortable.

The display is clear to me. From what I understand, this phone, as an economy model, has a lower pixel count that competing models. Even so, I think the clarity values are more than sufficient for the average user. If you have no activities you engage in on your phone that require extra high resolution, this phone is a good choice. The 4.3"" screen is adequate for easy viewing.

Sound quality is excellent. I have never had a problem understanding or being understood by anyone I have talked to. The small speaker actually sounds surprisingly good playing music (from your music library or FM radio) and doesn't even distort at max volume.

Design is fine, with rounded corners it fits comfortably in the hand. I particularly like the inverted ""dimple"" on the back. A finger of one hand fits well there while texting; ensuring a better grip on it and lessening the possibility of slippage.

Even though this phone is 3G and supposedly out of date by todays standards, response time has been incredibly fast. I'm more than satisfied.

The only complaint that I have is that this phone only has 4GB of built-in storage. Upon receipt, the phone has almost half of that in use so, the amount of apps you can install is limited. For most of us seniors, it is still adequate. Unless you want to install a dozen game apps to your phone, the amount of space will be sufficient. You do have the ability to install an SD card (up to 32GB) for extra storage. Unfortunately, many of the applications cannot be moved there to free up internal storage. You can however, store your music library and photos on the SD card.

The camera, while only 5MP, produces fine photos. There is no flash however and, if you're addicted to selfies, you'll be disappointed as there is only a rear facing camera lens. Battery life, I feel, has been exceptional. I'm only charging this thing up every other day.

Wifi has been flawless; I have absolutely no issues with this feature. Since I purchased this, I've gotten a portable Bluetooth speaker and this phone paired easily with it for great sound and the ability to use the speaker for conference calls.

For the most part, the switch to this smart phone has been intuitive for me, even though I am not technologically minded. There is lots of info on the web for any function you have questions about. If you are a senior like me, and know how to use a desktop computer, you probably have enough expertise to successfully make the switch to this entry level, economical phone. While TracFone is not known for selling high usage plans economically, the triple minute feature makes them more competitive. For approximately $25 a month (if you buy a 90 day plan) you get 450 min of talk time, 450MB of data (this is used to browse the web when you are away from your Wifi router) and 450 texts per month. While this won't be sufficient for a 16 year old Junior in high school it will be more than enough for a senior citizen who doesn't engage in 2 hour talk fests. Leftover time on the plan does carry over if the plan is kept current. If you're an ""age challenged"" person like myself, don't let the phrase ""smart phone"" scare you off. If you can operate a computer without having the Grandkids over every other day to unfreeze it, you can utilize and learn from this phone. Thanks for taking the time to read this lengthy review.

Update - 4-9-2016: I just purchased my first quarterly refill of ""pay as you go"" minutes and felt I should correct what was a misstatement in my original review. The plan I mentioned was $79.99 for a 90 day period. I just noted that there are some additional charges above and beyond that price. Most notably, for me, is just the sales tax (here in Texas it is 8.25%). Depending upon the state you reside in, you may pay more or less. While I'm still satisfied with my phone cost, in the interest of correctness, after the monthly breakdown I pay much closer to $30 per month than the stated $25 a month."
B00PWEN2ZE,JHM,5,"I have had the Moto E for over a week now. I have been a Tracfone customer for many years. The last phone I had was the ZTE valet. The Moto E came with a wall charger that has a micro USB on the other end. You will need a separate USB to micro USB to plug into your computer if needed. I have never had any issues with transferring service from one phone to the next. I logged in to my Tracfone account, and my phone # and minutes were transferred within 5 minutes. I used Motorola Migrate to transfer all my pics, music, etc. from my ZTE to the Moto E. Transferring my contacts via Bluetooth also worked flawlessly. I noticed my Android version on the Moto E is at 4.4.4, which I believe is an update from 4.4.2. Under settings the phone has a system update, which checks to see if you have the latest updates installed. I am hoping to get android 5.0 update when available. I installed a 4 gigabyte Sandisk micro SD card to store my music and photos. Their is one opening on the back to install the micro SD card. I believe 32 gigabytes is max. Wifi is excellent, I am able to pick up wifi as well as an IPad, whereas my ZTE was horrible. The screen is amazing, responding perfectly to the touch. I have had no lag whatsoever in opening any app or game. Web surfing is lightning fast. The FM radio works great. Your headphone cord acts as the antenna. The speaker sound is also excellent. The speaker is located on the front, where it should be. I have been able to play YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, etc.etc. flawlessly. I have taken a few pictures, and compared to the ZTE, they look great, even with no flash. The camera seems to let a lot of light in for a great picture. I like that you can tap the screen anywhere to take the photo. I will still use my digital camera for my important pictures.There are two buttons on the right side of the phone. One turns on the phone, the other adjusts the volume.There is a light on the front that flashes notifying you of a text, email, or missed call. This is the first phone I am not going to install a screen protector or cover. You can purchase different colored back covers from Motorola. GPS works perfect. YouTube and Netflix play full screen, and look amazing. Battery life is great. The Tracfone logo is on the inside of the back of the phone. When you snap the back cover on, the Tracfone logo is hidden. Moto Assist is handy to silence the phone during meetings, or overnight. The Moto E is CDMA and uses the Verizon network. The Moto E is 5 inches long, 2 1/2 inches wide, and 7/16 thick. In a nutshell, I love this phone. Compared to the ZTE, the performance is simply amazing in every way. I find myself using the IPad much less,since the Moto E works so well. Super responsive, looks very classy, FM radio, excellent WiFi connection, sound, etc.etc. I am not sure how the Moto E compares to the LG Ultimate 2, or the Alcatel Icon Pop, as I was unable to find a comparison as of 12/18/14. The only features I would like to have are a flash and autofocus for the camera.

**UPDATE 12/30/14** The Moto E is working perfectly. I have had no freezing or lag whatsoever. The WI-FI reception has been exceptional. I did not install a screen protector or cover, and the Moto E screen and case still look like brand new. The battery life is great. With a full day of normal use, web surfing, texting, calls, email, etc. etc. I am around 65 to 75% by the end of the day. I normally charge the phone daily anyway. Overnight, the phone will use 5 to 10% of the battery life, which is with Wi-Fi always left on. I replaced my wife's ZTE Valet with the Moto E also. If you are debating on upgrading from the ZTE Valet, you will not be disappointed. I still have not been able to find a comparison between the LG Ultimate 2, Alcatel Icon Pop, and the Moto E as of 12/30/14."
B00PWEN2ZE,User08,1,"I have been a loyal TracFone customer since 2005. My first phone was a Nokia 1100 with a monochrome display and I have upgraded many times over the years. Today I can no longer recommend the company to anyone due to their abysmal warranty policy, which I now -- for the first time in over a decade -- need to use.

I bought a brand new Moto E from an authorized TracFone reseller on Amazon in September 2015. Everything was great with the phone at first except the fixed focus camera with no flash, but I could live with that. Then media sounds stopped playing out of the speaker. I could no longer hear movies, music, games, etc. Throughout the day at work the phone would out of no where speak in a female voice that I had a headset attached. I tried blowing out the headphone jack, factory resetting, etc. Nothing worked. Luckily basic calls still worked. Phone had been carefully handled this whole time -- never dropped, never submerged in water.

I called TracFone and the rep told me they would send me a replacement phone, and in the same box would be a prepaid return label and envelope for my defective one. TracFone's web site stated the same (see image). Rep also stated that because I had the phone longer than a month, I would be receiving a refurb even though I bought mine brand new. Also stated the refurb would not have a new warranty, but would continue on the original phone's 1-year warranty. All of this was less than optimal, but I had no choice.

I received the box a few days later and it felt suspiciously light. Opened it and it was empty except for the return label and envelope. I called TracFone back and was told I had to send my defective phone in first before receiving a replacement, despite what the first rep and the TracFone web site stated. Like many TracFone customers, this is my only phone and I cannot be without my cell phone for work and emergencies. Not to mention there was no guarantee I would receive a working replacement with my data and airtime intact. I told them this was not an option and even offered to let them put a hold on my credit card if they were worried about not receiving the defective phone back. Went through several call center and live chat reps, posted multiple times on their Facebook page. TracFone would do nothing.

So ends my 11-year relationship with TracFone. Buyer beware: if you are going to do business with TracFone, bring your own phone/buy only their cheap phones so you're not out much when they break, and above all, expect ZERO customer service."
B00PWEN2ZE,Aaron Stout,5,"The Motorola E is one of Tracfone's first ""real"" Androids in the market. It's generous 4.3"" qHD display makes it look the part of an upper level Android, but doesn't have the costs like one. And while it's internal specs aren't anything to gloat, it'll get the job done.

Being a Tracfone user all of my life, I already knew what to expect from it, but first time Android users beware, as the minutes are counted differently. Instead of call time, texts, and data all coming from one bucket, they are divided up into their own separate buckets. Personally, I love how Tracfone has done this. Some months I might be using more texts than phone minutes, so I'll start calling people. Or optionally if I were to run out of texts, I could use Google Hangouts and message over data. It creates more ways to stretch your dollar.

Setup does take awhile to happen. Once you've typed everything into the Tracfone's website, you patiently have to wait, one hour personally, for Tracfone to deactivate your old phone, and transfer it to your new one. Once transferred you have to call a certain number and it ""programs"" your phone, with all of the Tracfone settings. It's not too long or tedious, but it is painful to wait for Tracfone to transfer your information as you wait to use your new phone.

One of the best things about this phone is the version of Android that is used. My Moto E runs off of Android 4.4.4, which is one of the newer versions. But this isn't the best part. After seeing my friend use their LG Fuel, their version of Android was modified. The options menus were different, not all of the base Android widgets came with it, and some base Android apps didn't work too well. This isn't the case with the Moto E. The options menus are almost exactly the same as my base Android, Nexus 7. I have all of the widgets. All of my base apps work perfectly. I have a feeling that this is because Motorola is owned by Google, so they closely working together, while LG can more freely do it's own thing. But nevertheless, this is why the Moto E wins me over.

While the internal specs aren't anything to brag about, they'll get the job done, especially for $99.99. The dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 boasts battery life and speed for entry level phones, and delivers. I use my phone an average amount for a smartphone user everyday, and it usually gets down around to 50%-60% before I charge it back up every night. The 1GB of ram isn't huge, but I haven't experienced many app crashes. But this can also be contributed to the limited internal storage on the phone. Tracfone and Motorola claim 4GB internal room, but the OS and base apps are included in this. The ""total space"" listed in the settings says 2.17GB, which I can believe is the accessible space. Even though all music, photos, and videos can be moved to the SD card, (apps say they can, but it doesn't really work very well, and I've never actually gotten it to work) there just isn't much room for a lot of apps.

The screen is actually surprising clear and good-looking for such a budget phone. It boasts a 540 x 940 screen resolution, and is often advertised with qHD - quarter HD, 1/4th of 1080p resolution. You can rarely pick out single pixels like some budget phones, and it's ~256 ppi is pretty well done. The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is the same as most phones today, and I have yet to get any scratches. But with how nice the screen looks, the 5MP camera doesn't do it justice. The fixed focus really hurts the value of the camera, as it sometimes struggles to do simple tasks such as scan QR codes. It can record up to 480p videos, but unless the lighting is above good, it'll look choppy. The lack of a front facing camera does take away from the full Android experience a tad, but it isn't the most expensive phone on the block, so it'll get the job done in a pinch.

The chassis of the phone is built pretty well. It's slim enough that it doesn't leave a huge bulge in your pocket. Near the top, next to the speaker, there is a light that will blink if there's a notification. It's very helpful in case I didn't catch the buzz or ringtone, but can sometimes get annoying because I'll have a game request that I want to save for later, but the light won't stop blinking until I dismiss the notification. The main speaker on the phone is on the bottom of the front, just below the screen. I actually really liked that they put it there, because it sends the sound straight towards me while I'm listening. The speaker is a pretty generous noise producer, and is louder than my Nexus 7's speaker.

Overall the Moto E for Tracfone is a great phone. It's the first true ""Android"" for Tracfone in my eyes, and is the first Android I would recommend out of Tracfone's long list. It may be a budget smartphone in comparison to some, but it will hold it's own against the big dogs, with just a few markdowns from the top-of-the-line phones. The Moto E is not a deal to be missed."
B00PWEN2ZE,g graham,5,"Update 7/28/16
This phone now doesn't have enough internal storage because the updates of preinstalled apps has taken it. You MUST disable some of the preinstalled apps AND uninstall their updates to regain some valuable internal storage.To do this go to Settings>Apps and touch the apps you don't use. Clear the Data first then disable the app and uninstall updates.
This phone requires at least 300 mb of free internal storage to update apps and to work properly.
Get a micro SD card to put music, photos and apps that you install on. To do this go to Settings>Apps and On SD Card and put a check mark in the ones that you want to move.
-------

First off i really like the Moto E. It stands head and shoulders over the first wave of Tracfone offerings. It only took Tracfone a year to start offering some decent phones.

Now i know how bad the ZTE Valet that i used for over a year really was. Though at the time i considered it ok and i guess it was. It was painfully slow at running some apps like the yahoo mail app in particular. A few apps would crash because of the lack of processing power. (I had two weather apps running which showed the temperature in the notification area and that was about all the ZTE valet could handle.)

The Moto E is quite fast and runs android 4.4.4. (1.2 Ghz dual core processor and 1 gig of RAM.) I tend to use one app at a time rather than multitask and there is no lag what so ever. I think it could probably handle several apps running at once as well. When i first connected to my router and signed into my Google account it proceeded to install all the Google Play apps that i had on my previous phone automatically as well as my contacts. The speed in which it performed this was amazing. It left out a couple of apps which i later installed but got most of them about 20. I also installed 11 apps from Amazon App Store whose names were stored in the cloud under my account. Five of the largest apps i moved to the micro SD card and still had half of the internal storage available (2.21 gb of internal storage available to user total initially).

The camera is 5 MP and is fixed focus only. This was the only slight disappointment of this phone. I was expecting an auto focus camera. I've taken a few photos in good light and they are sharp and clear with great natural color. The phone by default stores photos in internal memory and you can move them to the SD card by going to Settings->Storage->Move Media. When the camera is open swipe right to
show the camera settings and one of them makes the camera store the photos directly onto the micro SD card. The camera has HDR setting which allows greater detail in light or dark areas of the photo. The more photos i take the more impressed i am with color balance and clarity. 9/23/15 The camera now has an exposure control so it may be able to photo checks for deposit with banking app. Open the camera and swipe to the right to access settings. The second from the top (the hand touching inside a square) touch to turn it on.

The screen is crisp and clear (960x540 resolution) and at 4.3 inches is a very comfortable size. I find 5.1 inch screens a little too large for putting in your front pants pocket.

The speaker i found a little tinny and with too much treble at first but there is a built in equalizer (Settings->Sound->Audio Effects) which i set to Extreme Bass and it seems to help or possibly i've adjusted to the sound. The speaker is on the front which i like.

The Power Control widget placed on one of your home screens makes it easy to control what features are turned on or off though it lacks the Data setting.

I had considered buying the next higher Motorola model the Moto G and bringing it to Tracfone in their BYOP program but several people said it couldn't be done with a new Verizon Prepaid phone. There is now one review that claims he activated a new Moto G on Tracfone as of December 15th. The Moto E Tracfone was the safe route to go and i am very pleased with it.

Update 1/9/15 I bought a 32gb micro SD card class 10 and put 13gb of music on it from my PC. (I also moved the files from my previous card using the PC.) I now think the speaker sounds great after listening to some of the music. This is the first phone i've had where you could listen to music on the built in speaker and enjoy it. Also moving the files to the new card with an adapter in the PC was the easiest way."
B00PWEN2ZE,CC,5,"First I want to say that I purchased the Motorola Moto E as a birthday present for my mother who formerly had a QWERTY messaging phone on Tracfone. I chose the Moto E because I own the Moto G (Verizon) and thought that it was a great budget smartphone that fits my needs perfectly. My mom loves having a smartphone and being able to check her email on the go and play game apps. She picked up Android KitKat right away. That is one of the great things about this phone on Tracfone--it has KitKat and not some older Android OS like Gingerbread or Ice Cream Sandwich. Even though Motorola has said all their devices will be getting Lollipop, I doubt this Moto E will be since it is on Tracfone and they almost never seem to update their device's OS.
The Moto E is a little bit of a step down in almost every way than the Moto G. The screen's colors are not as vivid, the camera's photos are a little less crisp (although both don't take the greatest pictures), the physical buttons are squisher, and loading of webpages, ect is all just a tad slower which a dual core instead of a quad core processor. This aside, for an entry level smartphone user, that still wants a very user friendly and good experience with KitKat the Moto E is a great choice.
Like the Moto G, the Moto E has great call quality on both ends, the speakers are clear and crisp and loud when turned up a bit. The best part for Tracfone users is that (like the Moto G) the Moto E has an FM radio that does not use data. This is great when going for jogs, ect because of how limited most Tracfone user's data allotments are.
How does Tracfone do data? It's actually a perk of getting a Tracfone Android device. You buy a card, let's say 100 min (units) that that gets put in three seperate pots-- you will end up with 300 min 300 text and 300 MB of data from that one 100 min card. The only downside is that you can't use promo cards.
We were able to transfer my mother old number from her basic Tracfone to her Tracfone Moto E. It took a little over a day and about 45 min on the phone with Tracfone (their customer service leaves a lot to be desired) and then a second 25 min call to Tracfone to help with activation when the number was finally ported. Thankfully, she was able to keep her same account (her mins and service days from her old phone) and her number.
I paid $79.99 for the Moto E and in the box came the Moto E phone with stock black back (you can buy different colored/grip backs from Motorola), the irremovable battery already instead and 48% charged, white micro USB charger cord, and a 4GB micro SD card. That's the one better thing about the Moto E than the Moto G--it has a micro SD card slot to help with its only 4GB of storage space (Moto G has 8GB/16GB of storage space on device).
Overall this is a solid little device with Corning Gorilla Glass and a water resistant coating. I would recommend this phone for someone who uses Tracfone and wants the benefits of a smartphone or wants to upgrade a lower end Tracfone smartphone. However, if you are used to flagship devices with one of the big four (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile) this phone and Tracfone are not for you."
B00PWEN2ZE,fleabiscuit,5,"I have owned the Moto E for a month now, upgrading from a ZTE valet. I finally feel like i have a truly usable Tracfone, and wife is equally happy with hers. Itâs rather easy to use, sounds great, looks good, good screen, decent battery life, and for us cheap to use. We are a light user of the âphoneâ feature, mostly texting each other, and then usually in a wifi location. We keep building up tons of minutes, texts, and data, even when only purchasing 60 minute cards (3x everything remember). That brings our monthly out of pocket cost to about $6.67 a month. $6.67 a month! Good grief, a couple of coffees to go for the road costs more.

For the cost of the phone and monthly costs I truly cannot think of a worthwhile negative, and Iâm really good at that. Oh, maybe the camera. Fixed focus meh. Still gets the job done. For the rest of the features you should evaluate your particular needs, like FM radio. Really? Your mileage may vary. Apps run fairly snappy but Iâm sure someone can find one that wonât. Some people can break a steel ball.

Hey, itâs a good phone and I donât hesitate to recommend it. I find I can make it play nice with my Apple computers as well.

I recommend activating your new phone at the trackfone web site, make yourself an account first too. That makes activating, checking minutes, and buying airtime very easy. I had two swapped over in about 30 minutes on the computer. If you have to call use a land line or a different phone if you need to swap out another cell phone.

B00PWEN2ZE,Beth Adcock,5,"It was great until the screen went black, and I couldn't find any way to get it back on; it simply came back on its own once, then went black again and didn't come back on. I was unable to contact the ""seller"" because Amazon ran interference. The Customer Service Rep couldn't understanding that I couldn't send the phone back before getting a new phone because I needed to transfer a considerable amount of Tracfone calendar days, minutes, texts, and data units, not to mention to port my phone number over, but did issue a return label. Then he wanted to have a cell phone support person call me on my husband's Tracfone and put me on hold, which would have run my husband's time down. However, I'd already ordered another phone for my husband, so I transferred my number to the newer phone when it arrived, and ordered yet another phone, since my web searches weren't showing a pattern of similar problems, just loads of happy reviews. The return was easy, and Amazon made the refund as soon as they were notified that the package was on its way back to them. Now that I have a working phone again, I'm extremely happy with it, and my husband is similarly happy with his.

Prior to that episode, my review was Five Stars, and as follows:
Tracfone hasn't managed to dumb down this smartphone, and it really does act like one. I love that it runs the android apps I use on my Nexus tablet, and runs them well. It's got nice speed. Phone call quality is excellent.

Tip #1: If you've already got a Tracfone, you don't need to buy a card to use when activating it. You'll be credited with text and data along with days and minutes when those are transferred to this phone.

Tip #2: if you've got wifi, make sure your phone is using it before you start downloading apps. I thought I had the password in correctly, and my phone didn't inform me otherwise, so the initial app downloads ate up a chunk of my data allocation.

Tip #3: If you don't already have a Google Voice phone number, get one, and set the phone up to use that first. When you're on wifi, you won't eat up your Tracfone minutes."
B00PWEN2ZE,D. Caldwell,3,"As a cell phone it's great, as a smartphone it has limitations. There is not enough internal memory to allow more than a few apps, and I find I'm constantly trying to clear cache, etc. just to be able to update the default apps that came with the phone. I didn't think the lack of close focus or a small flash would make a difference, but it's also limiting. No scanning bar codes, etc. I bought my wife the LG L22C (Power) a month or two after I bought my Moto E. Now I wish we both had the Power. However, I'll continue using my Moto E until a new batch of improved Tracfones come out with a lot more internal storage. The ability to use a micro-SD card with the Moto E is not that helpful, unless you want to store music, videos/photos. Not many apps can be moved to the SD card."
B00PWEN2ZE,NJ scientist,1,"A very nice, cost-effective device UNTIL it fails. My speaker failed after 2 months. This was a predictable disaster; the Moto-E customer forum shows speaker failures dating back to June 2014. I will praise Motorola in one respect; their customer support site, RMA provision and Device Exchange process works very smoothly. I can only hope they have found the flaw and fixed it. I will then modify my rating upward. A real shame!
added : Warning!! Do NOT return defective Tracfone branded Moto-E's to Motorola!! The replacement they deliver do not have MEID's recognized by Tracfone, despite having a Tracfone modified OS. This prevents transfer of your account from the broken phone. Tracfone insists that you return your device to them for exchange .. and it takes ""forever""!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"I have been using the moto e for a year and can't find much that it cannot do when compared to my daughters $400 iPhone .. If there is one complaint it would be storage, but it is easy to disable the stock aps that are preloaded that you don't use freeing up room for aps that you do, I have Amazon, Waze,Textra, 3 bank aps, FB, messenger, words w friends, and a few more that all run fine. The camera is not the iPhone quality but can focus on checks for mobile deposits which is important to me. The case is really rugged and unless you are extreme I don't think an external case is neccesary, the case material is a non slippery mat finished hard rubber like material that extends a little beyond the screen giving it great fall protection. I think it is much better than iPhone in this area. The ""gorilla glass"" on my 1 year old phone looks new despite occasionally sharing space in my pocket with keys.. All in all along with tracphone service this is a really cost effective truly smartphone option."
B00PWEN2ZE,Joe,5,"Fantastic cell phone. However, purchase the Moto E that comes with a 400 minute card for $99.00 from shopcelldeals.com. They are selling it without the minutes for $99.00 also, so be careful which option you chose when you buy. The reviews said the dual core snap dragon is not as good as the quad core snap dragon on the Moto G. I have used this phone for two weeks and it is fast, really fast with the dual core snap dragon processor. Lots of apps run concurrently with out the phone speed degrading. The phone looks like it is worth significantly much more than a $99.00 phone. People have asked me about it and when I tell them it was $99.00 they can not believe it. And when I tell them it comes with a 400 minute card that translates into 1200 minutes, 1200 texts and 1.2GB of data they think I am lying. Essentially you get the phone free. I moved from a ZTE Valet which I used for 6 months. It was OK but a ""starter"" smart phone. This one is a real smart phone. I am told the new Moto E will have a quad core snap dragon processor so they must be clearing the inventory to make room for the new one. You can wait for the new one but this fits the bill. I am not sure you will get the deal with the 400 minute card when the new one comes out."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jim,4,"I struggled for a year with the Tracfone ZTE Valet Android phone. The slower processor, smaller screen an older operating system made it cumbersome to perform simple operations.
This Motorola Moto E is slightly larger, but much more user friendly.
Why did I wait so long?
I have been a Tracfone customer for 10 years, and this is by far the best phone I have used.
Here is what I paid:
$85 for the Moto-E phone.
$95 for a 1 year service card. This card come with 400 minutes, but the Moto E triples the minutes, triples the text messages and triples the data plan. So you get 1200 minutes of talk time. 1200 text messages (send or receive) plus 1200 MB of data usage.
For me, that lasts over a year.
So my annual cost is less than $200 -including a new phone every year."
B00PWEN2ZE,XP and 8,5,"Processor:
With a 1200mHZ dual core processor, this phone is faster than you would think. It plays Minecraft, Asphalt 8, and other 3D games easily.

Display:
The qHD display on this phone is beautiful. It has great color, dark blacks, bright whites, and both text and video looks very sharp. It has good viewing angles, however dims slight when tilted to the left, however this does not effect use.

Camera:
The 5MP camera is decent enough for everyday photo shooting. Of course, the lack of flash makes night shooting poor, and the lack of autofocus does not allow close ups. However, it has HDR and produces photos with great color, and at a decent resolution.

Sound: The front firing speaker is very loud and clear. Although it doesn't have stereo sound, it is still good enough for watching movies. It also has a built in equalizer, which is good for both the speaker and headphones. The ""Mobile Theater"" setting makes stereo headphones sound like a surround sound system, and it works very well."
B00PWEN2ZE,JH,5,"Great phone. Previous phone was the Samsung Centura. This phone is far superior in its processing speed, display and options. For the price it is a very good buy with tracfone service. I believe it utilizes the Verizon network. It has a relatively slim profile and is no heavier than my previous phone making it easy to carry in a front pocket. Has a solid feel, accommodates a data card for memory expansion, and has front firing speaker that is clear and adequate in volume. The blue tooth easily paired with my cars audio system for hands free use. I used Motorola Migrate app to move all contacts and images from my previous phone. The app worked flawlessly. I think I will be very happy with this phone for some time.
If you are looking for a smart phone with tracfone service I can't see how you can go wrong with this phone. Triple minutes apply to new minutes purchases and my previous minutes, text, and data were transferred from my previous phone upon activation. Activation was easily done online and accomplished within minutes. The camera images are good enough for my use although there is no flash for low light conditions. Also there is no front camera for Skyping or selfies. A few limitations, but what can you expect for a $100 smart phone. Strong reception of wifi. Use wifi and save your data. The display is Gorilla glass making it very durable and resistant to scratches. Will be adding a case cover to protect against drops. Battery seems to last several days depending on use.
Again, good overall buy if you are looking to keep the costs of a new cell phone and service in check. Personally I cannot justify spending more for my use."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kate Gryffin,5,"Love this phone, its our second one. We use Tracfone exclusively because we there is no plan out there that is as reasonable in cost. The Moto e is a smartphone with triple minutes for life which replaces our older tracfone with single minutes. We have two and the Moto e we buy the least amount of minutes for costs less than $7 a month. The other one has been running us about $10/month with the 200 minutes / 90 day card.
No, there is no front facing camera so it doesn't work for skype. Yes, it is only 3G, not 4 G. But, it does have wi-fi and wifi doesn't use up minutes. It has mobile data which can be easily turned on and off with an app to turn 3G on and off.. This gives you internet anywhere. We use it with google maps for driving directions which are much better that the ones on the garmin.
Two phones for just over $200 a year - if you need an economical plan and want to move up to smart phones, this is a good start."
B00PWEN2ZE,D. meadows,5,Cute little tracphone smart phone. Purchased for 19.99 for my son whom is 10. It has internet capabilities i didnt purchase data but he can use wifi at home and still be able to get on the internet. Hes able to get 500 minutes a month with our safelink plan and unlimited text. I thi k this is the best 19.99 spent . it even has a fm eadio already installed on rhe phone. He has downloaded games thst he can play to and from school . and i believe if he needed additional minutes its a double or triple minute phone... I might not have to purchase a real phone for him for a while.. Hopefully.. As long as he can talk or text he should be good. Only thing is it takes a longgggg time to charge.... Not sure why
B00PWEN2ZE,Helping2FindaWay,5,"At first this was a gift for my husband because the phone he had the screen broke. I wanted to get him something he could also listen to music on & of course thought of Tracfone because of the low monthly plans available. When I saw this phone I took note of the many good reviews saying the camera took great pics (in bright lighting), also video (also in good lighting), has a glass screen, water repellent back, also is by Motorola (a solid company).
This phone has wifi capabilities, hooks up to blutooth devices, including wireless headphones, the camera takes wonderful pics given there is enough light or else there's a little feature on it that you can lighten up a 'dark' picture before taking the pic, the video is nice with good lighting & the sound quality during calls or playing music is excellent. 4g of internal memory after all the factory apps doesn't make the phone slow & it can hold a 32g micro sd card for those apps that can be put on a sd, or music and videos. I am able to run the ""This Life"" app by Shutterfly to upload all my pics & videos onto, or just view them on the phone. There is an internal music player, GPS (that works, thankfully), google search by voice. I like that service is only $10 a month on the pay as you plan with Tracfone, which is broken down to 90 min of calls ($1 a min), 90 texts & 90 mb (how ever you say that one) of data. I use a text app so while i'm connected to wifi I am able to text for free on the app without using any of my 90 texts from the Tracfone plan. Calls, I still do make on the Tracfone plan, because there just isn't a free wifi app to make those. Bummer.
All around this phone is great. I bought it initially for my husband & really like it so I bought one for myself too! We haven't had any problems at all with these phones. I have taken so many pics and videos already & have a ton of songs saved on my sd card. the phone works wonderful & loads apps fast.
I have read reviews saying this phone is on Verizon but in my case, I'm not sure if the phone is or not, because sometimes I have a poor signal & other times there's a strong signal-either way, I haven't lost a call yet due to bad signal!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Ken Y,1,"Be aware that this is the 1st generation of the Moto E (released 2014). The more in-depth manufacturer description for the phone is INCORRECT when it states that it has a 4.5"" screen (which is only true for the 2nd gen Moto E).

This model does NOT have an autofocusing camera, so no close up pictures will be in focus. We were trying to use this with a barcode scanner and were puzzled at why it would not focus."
B00PWEN2ZE,RvaCountryFan,4,"I have never owned a smart phone before and wanted something affordable. I really like this smart phone. Its my very first and easy to use! Since I have trac phone with pay card, I didn't feel like switching to a plan. So I could me old trac phone number! Its very nice. The camera takes really sharp pictures- even though its only 5 megapixel. I'm not a big ""selfie ""person. So if you like to talk selfies, this phone will be more difficult, as it has no self facing camera. I can use instagram, email, and all apps with ease.
Some Pros:
If you're a trac phone user, switching from a non-android to an android phone is a breeze. You can keep your phone number and all the minutes.
Its big enough , but still more compact than other smart phone or tablets
The camera takes clear pictures and video for the amount of space it has
I had no trouble finding out how to use this phone and it was my very first smart phone ever
Its incredibly affordable for such a nice phone

Some Cons:
Apps drain the battery more quickly than i expected. I usually must charge after 12 hours of use
It doesn't have self facing camera for ""selfies"", but I'm not a narcissist so I don't care
It smudges easily so keep it in a case
Phone calls sometimes pixelate or not as ""clear"" as some other cell phones."
B00PWEN2ZE,Matthew,5,"Very good phone. I use it for a mp3 player for my car. The battery lasts several days before I have to charge it. It is running 4.4 which is pretty old, but for my purposes it works perfectly. I'm sure I could have gotten an actual mp3 player for cheaper, but this works great for my purposes. In the off chance I loose my main phone, I can use this in place of it and basically have a fully functional phone at a moment's notice.

The camera is pretty bad, but then again we are talking about a phone running Android KITKAT which was released pretty much three years ago. Even though that may not seem a long time, vast improvements have come in cell phone technology.

The default 2gb of storage is pretty trash. I was able to only hold a couple songs which would have defeated my purpose. I got a SD card which I am able to fill up to 32gb. The speakers are average, and I can't actually hear too many audio differences between this and my iPhone 6s. The only time I can really hear a difference (audiophiles, please feel free to shoot me) is when the volume is maxing. However, the speakers don't matter to me as I just plug the phone into an aux card which leads to my cars speaker.

I didn't activate the TracFone service so I can't comment on whether or not it's good. Apparently TracFone uses Verizon for the Moto E, so I can't comment on that either as I am a T-Mobile customer.

I'm not sure for other purposes, but for mine, the phone is great at what it does. If you somehow rate this phone less than 4 or 5 stars, it's more than likely your fault. This is an old phone and is not the cutting edge of technology anymore (or ever for that fact, the Moto E was for entry level customers).

TL:DR; I use it for a MP3 player. Buy it."
B00PWEN2ZE,j.bockius,5,"Well worth what I paid for this phone. I still have problems with some of the features, like there is no way to get acknowledgement when you receive text messages when you unlock the phone. Every phone I've had up to this point always had this feature but this one only acknowledges when you send messages. Hmm, I know when I send messages. Don't need the phone to tell me that. I am not 'techy' and I'd rather the phone be user friendly. But otherwise I like the phone. It was well worth the 40 bucks I paid for it. And you get triple minutes when it's a tracfone. Since I don't hang on the phone like a lot of people do I pay only 20 dollars every three months for service. That's less than 7 bucks a month--can't beat it. If you aren't a techy phone fanatic that always has the phone in your hand this is a great buy.I play games, use this as my work phone, and use the internet on it and never seem to run out of time or data with it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Paso Fino,5,"Awesome Phone!

I've converted from iPhone to Android because the price/performance is compelling for this device.

It takes some getting use to because this phone is highly configurable. We purchased two of these and ditched our older iPhones.

The cost savings are compelling. We are saving $1,000 per year in cell phone bills by switching to Tracfone. No contract or monthly payments for overpriced iPhones."
B00PWEN2ZE,Donna,3,"Screen size is good. I don't do selfies so did not care about not having a face camera. But, what annoyed me was that the description showed this phone could keep a charge for up to 8 days. After 12 hours, the phone would be at 50%. After 24 hours, phone would be dead or close to it. I would try everything to slow the power bleed. After another search, did find a forum post about the exact same problem. The poster noted that if you turn off your mobile data (his was 2G, mine is 3G) there is no longer the power suck. I do go one step further, I go to settings and turn off WiFi. This does not stop incoming and will auto on if you use it. I noticed it does not drain as much either when I do this. Please note this doesn't happen with all Moto E phones and I could never figure out why some and not others but please with phone now that issue is over. This is not my dream phone, but after I got the power suck under control, it works, it does what I want it to do and if it didn't...there is an app for that!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Jeffpb,5,"Well worth every penny! I got this because the low cost Samsung junk I purchased last year for $85 was constantly locking up and requiring reboots. I'm so happy I made the switch to this phone!
I currently have this Bluetooth paired with my smart watch Asus ZenWatch, with no problems. The two stay in contact through most of my 1 bedroom condo. Buy an SD card and move as many apps to it as possible. The phones internal memory is small.

Pros:
1. Fast boot up time.
2. Fast access to whatever I'm doing. No freezes or lockups like the Samsung junk phone.
3. Switch is protected so it's not constantly turning on like the Samsung junk phone.
4. Nice camera.
5. Good WIFI.
6. Excellent Bluetooth.
7. Battery last a minimum of 16hrs and looks like I could get 24 hours with the battery saver activated. Recharge is quick.

Cons:
1. Wish it had more internal memory. I added an SD card, but some apps insist on being installed on the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Miss Opinionated,5,"I think that people are initially hung up on having a two-year contract with a cell phone carrier. I used to be the same way. I will say this much when you have a contract you may have a better functioning telephone, as far as features, but overall most of these phones are capable of doing what we needed to do. So anyway, I needed an extra phone for various reasons and I just went on Amazon one night and found this phone and it's worth it. it's a smartphone it has a qwerty keyboard. It has various ringers. Various screensavers that are actually cute. It's no different than any other phone I can check my email I normally log into my internet service at home if I need to watch videos on my phone or whatever. So for the money, which prepaids are generally reasonably priced, this phone is really awesome if I had to recommend it to somebody I would. The only thing I did notice is the other day I tried to use the flashlight and I didn't see a flashlight option on the on the screen on the settings so I downloaded a flashlight app but otherwise it's fine. . So my last point I wanted to make was I opted for this phone because I knew that I would only need it here and there. So even though there are prepaid services that you can pay for monthly, this phone I purchased minutes and the minutes never expire they kind of roll over. Purchasing minutes is not something that I'm really big on but for what I needed this phone for it's perfect"
B00PWEN2ZE,Gallant,4,"I was looking for a cheap phone, because to be fair, I have an old iphone I use with the wifi on it only, and do most of my talking online or through watsapp, so I didn't really need a fancy (and expensive) phone + subscription.

However, one for calling people outside of watsapp and apps is kind of handy so I was looking for one. And found this one. I'll be honest - I thought it would be a crappy phone with snake and solitaire game on it.

Much to my surprise to find a phone like this with app store, browser, camera, and everything you'd want in a smartphone. It can seriously compete with the modern android and iphones, that's much how it caught me off guard.

With the Tracfone subscription I pay 20 dollars for 3 months, giving me 60x3 (this phone tripples your airtime!) 180 minutes of call time and 180 text messages. Absolutely perfect. It has since then replaced my old phone as this one is so much better. And that only for $18.50 with a $20 3 month subscription.

Skeptical me however is still trying to find a catch as all of this sounds too good to be true. Or it's just a perfect fit for me personally, who calls rarely and uses wifi for most his phone business. Definitely a nice surprise.

Edit: Update 4/8/2017 - The phone has slowed down a lot and I have to adjust my review a little bit now I have been using it for a longer period of time. It's still a good phone, for sure, but even with added memory (microSD) it will have little space to install things on. Keeps asking me to remove things in order to update apps.

It's also slow, and apps sometimes just fall apart when using them, especially the more modern ones like Snapchat. The camera is really poor on it also.

However - it's still a great phone for this price. Just not as smooth as it was in the beginning and you can't install/update unlimited stuff on it. For calling and cost it's excellent however."
B00PWEN2ZE,Leenie,5,"Wow. I love this phone! I have had a basic tracfone for several years, and needed to upgrade to an Andriod to get current. I got this at $34.99 (originally introduced at $120 in 2014) after reading reviews and realized that it was the phone to take me into this century. It has wonderful features which I never imagined I would be able to get at a Tracfone price. I even have loaded Netflix onto the phone and can use it, if I really want to watch something on that small of a screen. I have loaded my email account onto the phone and it is great to be able to screen my emails as the come in. I cannot always see the details on the emails, such as some pictures, but I go to my Kindle or computer for that anyway. It connects easily to wireless networks, which really helps keep the data use down. I love the feature where I can text by talking, search google by talking, etc. This is the Motorola Moto E First generation, which is smaller than the 2nd generation. I like having this smaller phone. I got one for my husband, too, so he can get his work emails, too. The only downside I have found is that it is 3G, but not 4G. I was in a very remote place last weekend (Chama, NM) and did not get a signal, so I was out of contact for the time I was there. The batter life is quite good. It can probably standby for about three days before requiring a charge for someone who it not a phone junkie. With tracfone minutes, I will probably still not spend more than $10 per month with this triple minute phone (triple talk, text and data in three different totals). My Dad is now looking in to this very economical and very smart looking phone!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Nibor Diva Tsidun,4,"FINE SMARTPHONE FOR NEWBIES w/Helpers
This smartphone is the very first smartphone I ever touched. And after reading some reviews both before and after purchasing it. I need to say I was able (after 1.5 hours and getting transferred a couple times to Tracphone reps that donât speak the English language very well) to transfer my tracfone flip phone number, time remaining and minutes. That also gave me equivalent text and data units. This DOES come with Triple minutes. That does NOT mean that minutes come with the phone. You must either buy an airtime card or have some minutes to transfer. What triples is the minutes bought on an airtime card.
The phone does NOT come with ANY logical instructions. So if this is YOUR first smartphone it will be a good idea to have someone around to show you how to use it. I didnât even know how to answer it when it rang. I have been using computers since 1978, but smartphones are a different thing all together. Be careful if buying a case for it. Cellphone cases are VERY individual. (this is a Moto e 1st generation) I did purchase a memory card for it. It has very little memory and it will tell you you cannot install anymore apps due to memory limitations after you have installed just a couple. I wish I had NOT changed the ringtone because once you do, it has an issue with the initial volume; you canât hear it. As it rings the volume increases. By the time you can hear it the caller may have hung up!
Iâve only had this for about 2 weeks. When I learn more about it I will update this review."
B00PWEN2ZE,John L. Garza,3,"This is a great phone at a great price, but it has one severe limitation that I wasn't aware of when I placed the order. This phone has only 2 gigs of built in memory, and that means one simple thing, you will not be installing apps of any significant size! I found a few apps that I wanted to install that simply don't fit in the onboard memory. There are some games that simply won't fit, even if it's the only app you try installing. Sure, you can install little apps, things like a Restaurant App for ordering from your phone, but most games are just out of the question.

It's a real shame, because I love the phone and the price is perfect for someone on a limited budget, but that issue with memory is an insane omission! Not having at least 8 gigs is unbelievable. Having only 2 is a deal breaker for most people. Had I known it was that limited, I'd never have purchased this model phone. I've included a 32 gig memory card, but sadly, most apps won't install there regardless, so the main purpose of the memory card is photo's, music or video's, apps just can't install there, or at least very few, as some show that segments of apps can install on the card, but most will not."
B00PWEN2ZE,Carroll,5,"I wanted to upgrade from a bare bones flip phone; however, I'm a senior citizen and before I spent big $$$ for a phone I wanted to see if we were compatible. The good new is we are! I'm still learning but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase. The sound quality is very good, the screen size is close to perfect and I have no bad things to say about it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kit Lemmonds,2,"Due to google's increasing bloatware and Motorola not allowing the boot loader to be unlocked for rooting to uninstall that bloatware (the tracfone version of this phone is not eligible for unlocking), this devices memory will be almost full the second you enter your google account info and all the google bloatware begins to update. This device won't let you move the google bloatware to the sd card, so even though I only use one or two of the 12+ google apps like google drive, youtube, etc - it sits in main memory and prevents me from installing apps I'd actually use. For this reason, there are better options for the money right now."
B00PWEN2ZE,S. Petty,3,"I rarely use my cell phone (when I want to use it, the battery's frequently too low). I had a phone with a built in keyboard that I liked, but TracFone discontinued service for it. I bought this one to replace it. I prefer the old keyboard, and I liked that the phone kept track of how many minutes I had left. TracFone's website used to let me check with the phone number and the last 4 digits of the SIM card, but now I have to login in order to see how many minutes I have (it's been so long, I've forgotten the password). The last time I bought a card, I didn't get a text stating that minutes were added, only that time was added. I could not get the TracFone app to download on this (it kept stalling), and the TracFone app didn't work well on my Samsung tablet. It may be time to switch to a monthly plan, but I really don't use it enough to justify the expense (I think I've bought 2 cards since spring). I do like the Triple minute plan that this came with (so I'm spending less), but I'm buying cards by guess instead of knowing what my minutes are these days. It seems silly not to have something pre-installed on the phone to keep track of it when it's a pay-as-you-go card phone.

The battery these days lasts about a day or so before it needs charging, but I suspect that's from abuse (leaving it with low battery without realizing it), rather than a flaw in the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"I'm new to smart phones. Note that I rarely use the WiFi part. Can't say much about the web performance. I rather use my PC for browsing.
Battery life is good. Easy to use. Decent camera. Phone reception for calling (over Verizon) is good. I'm still no friend of touch screens but the typing assistant makes life much easier. If you use it straight as a phone for calling and texting I would recommend it. So far no problems with speakers (it's not a boom box after all - it's a phone...). This is not the latest Moto E model. It's the previous one that works (triple minutes) with Tracfone. Hope to see newer versions of this for Tracfone in the future. Only gripe: Went $30 cheaper after 4 weeks of purchase. But that can happen...

Update: ok, after a couple months of usage I can say it's still pretty good phone. But I'd like to update a few things.
WiFi is not great from a rural area. From my place I usually have only a fair connection. Camera is pretty crappy and makes
blurry pictures sometimes when you don't hold it steady, and unfortunately there no flash available which makes it for picture taking in the dark useless. The dimension listed here on Amazon are WRONG. This phone is size is NOT 8.2 x 6.4 x 2.1 inches but rather 4.91 x 2.55 x 0.48 inches! Otherwise it would be bigger than an Iphone which of course it's NOT.
Again if you use it only for phone calls and texting is works pretty good and for the current price of around $40 and triple minutes with Tracfone it's a no brainer."
B00PWEN2ZE,Vista2020,5,"I bought this for my wife about a month ago and she absolutely loves it. I was really surprised that it is such a quality made product for the price. I think I paid about $40 less for this phone than mine (and they both are Android 4.4). The QHD display is really sharp with vibrant colors and fast graphics. I added a 32GB card to it that should provide plenty of memory for pictures, video, and music. I'm very impressed. And a happy wife gives me a happy life. Thanks Motorola. :-)"
B00PWEN2ZE,A Very Happy Shopper,5,"This is an Impressive phone for such little money, IMPORTANT INFORMATION !!! YES, this phone IS SafeLink Compatible.
When calling Safelink to activate (either new service or transferring information from current Safelink service) if Safelink customer service representative tells you this phone can't be used, simply say thank you, hang up and call back. You'll get a different representative,
This happened to me, I was told I couldn't use this phone, after doing some reacearch on Tracfone and Safelink, I called back to ask why I couldn't use this phone, I never got the chance, the second representative was kind and efficient, the phone was working perfectly in less than 10 minutes, all my information, minutes were transferred, I've had it 2 weeks, with out any complaints at all.
I hope this information is helpful, I see this question asked several times, with various answers.... confusing!
DON'T hesitate if you're thinking of purchasing this phone.
If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. A very Happy Amazon Shopper"
B00PWEN2ZE,neognomic,2,"No, not even as a backup. Well, I suppose if it's 20-buck$ like it was when I got it on sale and you are absolutely certain it will be a temporary(as in less than a month) backup it can be tolerated. It might even be a good thing because of how much one will learn to appreciate the smarter Notso-Smart Phones.
I mean after using the Moto E for a while I even appreciate the LG Sunset which I had begun to dislike almost as much as the ZTE(any ZTE but especially the ZTE Valet).

Too many 'Notso-Smart' irritating items to list so will just give one: if you press any phone number summary, those, um, people at Motorola call the number. You cannot get squat for info about the NUMBER THAT CALLED YOU without jumping thru hoops backwards.
That and other firmware and software make it the weirdest default phone setup I have ever had in the 45 years I have been buying phones.

Well, a second Notso-Smart item: BATTERY LIFE IS OUTSTANDINGLY BAD. If I had to use this phone for work for a week I'd lose my mind, or my job. With NO activity(other than incoming spam calls), it does not last more than a few days.

You can of course do whatever but You Have Been Warned, ;)."
B00PWEN2ZE,Keith,1,"I've had the Motorola Moto E, Smart phone (Prepaid Tracfone carrier),for about 5-weeks. Tracfone CANNOT make my phone deduct minutes correctly. It's OVER CHARGING for text messaging. How much you ask? EIGHTY-SIX voice minutes for every text sent. The phone even did this for the tech guy when he tested it, after adjusting settings 'Over-the-Air"" (the ordinary way they program/activate phones. Over the course of three days, I've Made four calls to their customer service/tech, and each time a tech changed settings, but only improved the condition. After their last adjustment, it now deducts two minutes of voice time for every text. They cannot fix the problem. I've chatted with them three times online, and they're indiifferent to the situation, enjoying the fact I've used 128 minutes of my call plan trying to get them to fix their ""settings"". I'm going back to a plain-old cheap ""feature phone"" that makes & receives calls & texts. This phone with Tracfone service is terrible."
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert Mathews,5,"I didn't expect much from such a cheap little thing - I just wanted to replace my old flip-phone. And at first, I wasn't too surprised. It took a while, and a lot of fooling around, to get anything other than the phone working. Even the TracFone MyAccount app took forever, and there were some tricks to make the wi-fi work with my home router. But once I started to understand it, I was amazed. Now I even have my Kindle app, and I can read all my books - yes, the tiny screen is big enough to read. I downloaded hours of music and figured out how to make it play random selections. Its only remaining pain is trying to type on the tiny virtual keyboard. Sometimes it will expand when turned sideways, but not always. Texting with your thumbs? Forget it. But that's a small price to pay. And I would love to see a document that tells what all the little symbols at the top of the screen represent. Even the Motorola site is no help. In summary - despite some minor, almost trivial shortcomings, I don't think I've ever bought anything that was a better value for the price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Citizen,5,"My grand kids ages 10 & 7 absolutely love their Motorola Moto E phones. Even better, I love these phones for them. Especially with the Triple Minutes deal from TracFone... $29 card with - 120mins, 120txts, 120mb data for 3 months = 360mins, 360txts, 360mb data for 3 months. The data is a bit low but not really a problem for young kids. It is easily managed when you consider that they can run all the data they want on home wifi or at McDonald's or all over town where free wifi is provided by businesses. They download games at home and play them offline when and where they want while having the phone handy for calls and texts. The batteries last several days with moderate use and the screen, camera and sound are great! The three of us were flying together during the Summer and watched the Olympics on their phones... Great!!! We added 32GB SD cards and rubberized Tekcoo cases... All good. Oh, and here's the kicker, every one of their friends want one too... Get on the bandwagon now!"
B00PWEN2ZE,CP,5,"I have only had this phone for a day, but I am totally awed by it. I will admit that my last phone was a low-end Huawei Glory, which I purchased from Tracfone when I signed up for their service. The Huawei served me well, but there were several things that I didn't like about it. One of them was that it had a plastic screen, and that means that it was not as responsive to my tapping as glass screen is. I have an old iPhone 4 that I play with, and noticed right off that the Huawei with its plastic screen was not as sensitive or accurate when tapped. The Huawei was also very slow, but it was a low-end phone, so I didn't discredit it for that.

Now, the Moto E isn't the most advanced smartphone you will find, but it is plenty powerful enough to suit my needs and wants. This phone has the Corning Glass Gorilla screen, which is a pleasure to use. Sure, glass makes the phone a bit heavier than plastic, but it's a very worthwhile trade. The screen is larger than on the Huawei, but not so large that the phone won't fit in my running waist belt.
Everything about this phone tells me that it was well designed, and built with quality in mind. I have always thought of Motorola as the leader in radio technology, and what is a cell phone? It's a radio!

If you get this phone for Tracfone service, get it here on Amazon from Shopcelldeals. You can read my review of the seller if you want more details."
B00PWEN2ZE,RichardP,5,"I have always liked Motorola products. They are well though out, high quality and this Moto E smartphone is no exception. You will want to throw your ZTE smartphone against the wall and stomp on it after you get to use this phone. That's how good this phone is in comparison. The only downside if any is that it could have more internal memory and have a front facing camera as well. But for this price I really cant quibble. Buy an micro sd card and move as many apps to the SD card that you can to save your internal memory space. If your not going to put a lot of apps on the phone the internal memory should be sufficient for everyday use. The phone has a great response and battery life is good on a charge. The WiFi reception is far superior to the ZTE and overall cell reception is what you would expect in a cell phone. The android system is KitKat and comes with a few moto apps that come in handy. Highly recommended!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Mike P,5,"Wow... such a deal.
For me its a portable Wi-Fi device to play with and likely never will see use as a cell phone. Will spend its life connected to the internet.
Reading and watching some video's had said it has wifi A/GBN but there is no A, sadly - but 2.4 Wi-Fi works flawlessly well. I'll just need to enable 2.4 on my laptop for moments of Lenovo uShareIt file transfers to or from, or plug in a usb cable.
Slow to charge, maybe 4 hours from maybe 35% - but the charge is very long lasting... surely should run idle well over 24hrs with 2 messenger apps, two mail apps, plus OneDrive, OneNote, a calendar and Netflix always connected, plus the ok google and moto stuff listening to me and to the internet. I charged it to 100% and spent 24 hours most playing with it installing apps and goofing with Netflix videos before charging it again.
Android 4.something auto-updated quickly to 4.44, apps cant directly write to a microSD card, cant root it as the tracfone bootloader is unlockable. Might search Moto E XT830C .. nobody seems able to get root privilege on its android KitKat 4.44 sadly. Software will save pics/video/downloads and minimal configs to SD. Another words, you can only install a few apps even after disabling some of the included google apps.
Out of box said something like 2gb of storage and quickly went to 800mb free. So it needs a SD card added to move stuff and apps into.
Only have had it two days.. hope it last a long time .. .$20 for a touch screen internet tablet, but miniature size, seems like a pretty good deal."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michael L. Knapp,5,"I love this phone. I don't use my phone a lot & Tracfone has always met my needs while my wife uses a Verision iPhone. My last phone looked like an android smart phone but actually functioned more like an old flip phone. It finally gave out & I found this for a great price & decided to try it out. As time went by it completly blew me away. I discovered it did about everything my wife's iPhone 5s did & did it just as well. I had never texted before because of how difficult it was with the old phone but now do. The navigator, the web browser, the android equivalent of Siri, the music player, I love it all. And it's very easy to figure out. My wife pays $70 a month for her service, I pay $30 every 3 months for mine. When I switched to my new phone they let me keep all the minutes, including the triple minutes that I had on the old one & added an equally amount of data plus the minutes & data that were included with the phone when I bought it. My wife tried it & likes it as much as her iPhone & when her 2 year contract ends in February plans to get one of these & go with Tracfone. Or course for hardcore IPhonies this would probably never do but if you're not married to the brand save yourself a lot of money & give this a try. For most people this phone would be more than enough."
B00PWEN2ZE,Charlotte,5,"I personally have used only TracFone prepaid phones for as long as they've been available - at least 15 years. This particular model is the best one yet. It has more ""bells and whistles"" than any of the other cell phone brands TracFone has used (LG, Samsung, UMX, ZTE, etc). It's also easier to use than my last one and has interesting options where you can set it to go to sleep and wake up at your choice of times. It also had an app that made it possible for me to transfer everything from the old phone to this one (including text messages, photos, call history). It did have a slight problem with my contacts - not all of those migrated over - so I had to add the rest manually. The most amazing thing about TracFone prepaid phones is that the only problem I ever have is (like any other cell phone), the battery life eventually shortens considerably making it necessary, of course, to buy a new one. I've never had a call dropped, had the phone turn itself off, or been unable to log on to WiFi. There is also the added attraction that when you buy a ""card"" you get triple minutes, etc.; you can buy minutes, data, and texts separately; or set up a monthly add on of minutes, etc. There is never a contract. And lastly - TracFone cell phones are reasonably priced. This one was $20.00 on sale as most (but not all) are - so much easier(!) to afford than the $500 or $600 cell phones touted by T-mobile or Apple."
B00PWEN2ZE,Christopher B.,5,"While it appears that you must register the phone, you can bypass this by tapping the back/home buttons and jumping to the homescreen. From there, this can be used as a wifi phone, and it works incredibly well for the price ($19.99+tax). I use it primarily for an app Vikings: War of Clans, in which there is a slight amount of delay once in a while. It plays the app perfectly, let's me check my email, and provides a backup phone if I ever need to use it for its intended purposes. It does play with apps well though. My one complaint is that it does not support some apps (such as Vikings), but there are several third party markets available to bypass this limit (I used APK Pure and downloaded what I needed, which worked perfectly). All-in-all, for the price, this is a great smartphone. It feels great as well, has a nice semi non-slip backing, and great haptic feedback. All-in-all I'd highly recommend this as a backup/second phone, or even a phone for a youngling (a smart phone for $20!). It's also pretty durable all on its own."
B00PWEN2ZE,RED,2,"This phone has a excellent performance and it runs very well for a Tracfone. This is the best Tracfone. I bought this as a gift for my Mother, she couldn't t believe how well the performance was for this phone. It gets the job done for her needs.
Unfortunately, The volume on the phone went out in less than a week. I had to contact Tracfone, and they have to send a replacement. I am a bit disappointed with this issue. Hopefully the replacement will work out with this phoneðð"
B00PWEN2ZE,Blewe Hare,4,"Purchased for no-techy husband. Its his first smart phone and he has been able to adjust quickly from his old LG flip phone. Have been using the phone for the past 2 months and have had no problems with texting, photos or making & receiving calls. He wanted a basic easy to use smart phone and this suits him perfectly. He has had to adjust to charging more frequently than with the flip, but that is expected. Sound quality is good as he does have some hearing loss and this was an important factor in his decision on which phone to purchase. He does not use for games or browsing."
B00PWEN2ZE,C. P. Hendrix,4,"I've always preferred Motorola and was extremely disappointed a couple years ago when I tried to transfer my TracFone account into a great Motorola phone. I gave them everything they asked for to verify my account, and was then asked, ""Which Tracfone would you like?"" So now, Motorola made this one available and I was quick to transfer my Samsung Century. The actual transfer of data took about a half-hour with a very good tech from Guyana, but it took the rest of the day and into the evening to sync everything up like is should be. I have my preferred ringtone, which came from the other phone, and I've uploaded a couple apps so far. Getting everything in Google to work took a while. I still endorse this one, but be patient. And it helps to have good tech savvy friend, or some friendly teens! Good luck."
B00PWEN2ZE,JLS,5,"Bought this phone a couple of months ago to use with my Tracfone service. It's my first smart phone (I'm a late adopter!). The Moto E is an excellent, high-quality phone. At the price I paid (an advantage of being a late adopter), it's a screaming deal. Nothing about it looks or feels cheap. One of the most impressive features for a phone at this price is the ""gorilla glass"" used... very highly scratch resistant except for sand... I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. The camera is a step or two below the norm for today's phones, but that matters little to me... I use an actual camera for any photography that's important."
B00PWEN2ZE,James F.,5,"If you had a ZTE Valet and you're sick and tired of the wi-fi then this is your phone. The screen is very responsive, The voice and reception is good. Everything transferred over to my new phone after downloading the Motorola software. Basically all I did is follow the instructions do a QR scan of my new phone and it used my wi-fi to transfer everything over. The camera is OK for a cell phone but it doesn't have a flash. The ZTE Valet's camera wasn't much better at night but at least I could use the flash light app. That's the only thing that sucks. I can't use the flash light app. But everything else is so much better, faster and clearer that I don't care. After all, I only wanted the phone triple minutes and texting. Everything else is gravy. Can't beat the price."
B00PWEN2ZE,heatherdou,5,"I absolutely love this phone!!! I had the samsung galaxy centura for 3 years but it kept freezing and couldn't get on the internet. This phone however is awesome, fast and i can actually say its a true smart phone. Camara is pretty awsome too! I had no issues transfering my tracfone number to this phone and all my contacts and what not were imported as well. Very happy!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Janet Griffin,5,"Best phone I ever owned from Tracfone. I had the Samsung Galaxy Centura, I hated that phone. It would freeze all the time. It always needed to be rebooted and there were other issues. If your considering buying a new Tracfone you will definitely love this phone. I have none of the issues I had with the other phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,John rourke,5,"I have been a tracfone user for several years and their prepaid plan works perfect for my needs. I have had the Moto E for two weeks now and it works flawlessly. Screen responds fast to user input with brilliant clarity. The 4.3"" screen size is just right to handle ans fits easily in a front pocket. I have used a majority of the features and I am very pleased; good sound quality from front mounted speakers, gps is perfect, FM radio (nice addition) and very good wi-fi reception. Picture quality is OK but, I didn't plan on using it as a hi-res camera anyways."
B00PWEN2ZE,DALE,5,"I ordered this new tracfone to update my older one that went out of service and am amazed of the features this phone has compared to my older one I had for about 12 years with no such problems at all. this was shipped very well with all the accessory's that was advertised with it, I had to get help from tracfone in order to transfer my number to this new one , the company was excellent with there help and expertise to get my phone activated and in service, I would recommend this tracfone for anybody upgrading to a newer style. thank you . DALE"
B00PWEN2ZE,Dale Rice,5,"I am very happy with this Tracfone cellphone, that I just bought. Prior to purchasing this cellphone, I checked the Tracfone website, in order to be sure, that the tracfone would be useful in the geographical areas, where I normally travel. Because of this and its features, it suited my needs. The price was also to my liking. I recently installed a 32 GB memory chip, which I bought locally at a Target store. I had no trouble in transferring my minutes from my old Tracfone, model v176, to this new Moto E Tracfone cellphone, through my account with the Tracfone website. I made one phone call the next day as a follow up, due to a request for final confirmation, via email, from Tracfone. The cellphone was already working, so I didn't see the need for a phone call, but a short phone call was easy. All the hard work was already done on the website the previous day. It will take me a while to get use to all of the phone's features, but this task is not difficult. This phone is definitely a big step up from my v176 Tracfone. I will use the cellphone primarily for emergency purposes, as I did before, so a Tracfone is ideally suited to my needs. It is cost effective. I also just purchased a protective skin for this cellphone, that I expect to receive shortly. Because this phone has triple minutes, data, & text, I may begin to use this cellphone a bit more often, than I would have otherwise. This phone is quite a deal !!!"
B00PWEN2ZE,K Walt,5,"This phone, I've had it for over two weeks now, is great! Does everything, even pictures, very well. The screen is excellent, with vibrant colors. It is fast and smooth to the touch when in use. The phone call quality is excellent in both directions. Its size is comfortable in both the hand and pocket, too! What more could I ask for? A flash would be nice, but then, my iPhone 4 didn't have a flash either. Moto E is an excellent product at any price! So easy to use I bought one for my 86 year old Dad, he actually uses it!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Solarium Moon,5,"It truly feels like the future when you can get this much phone for this price. And with Tracfone, you can cheap out on service as much as you can afford to cut.

The phone does everything an average Android phone owner would probably want, with the exception of taking good pictures, because the camera is kind of poor...compared to phones that cost a lot more. And I guess no front-facing camera means no video chat...but who cares.

If you're a Tracfone customer in a place in your life where you want to buy a smartphone, get this one. It's not worth it to cheap out with one of the lesser offerings."
B00PWEN2ZE,Fantasticalice Alice,5,"Got this on a deal-of-the-day and I couldn't be happier. I visited a gal who lives in the boonies and she has spotty cell service. Not me My Trac Phony worked just fine (she has AT&T). This phone is a lot of fun for this ol' granny. Welcome to the future Alice! Takes great pictures too! UPDATE: Phone still works perfectly! For a ""starter"" phone this deal rocks!"
B00PWEN2ZE,CarlBudaTx,4,"I was paying $200/month to Verizon for 2 lines (the phones were free with 2 year commitment). Yes Verizon and is much more expensive, but Ii have tried ATT, Sprint and Cricket and Verizon has by far the best coverage. I heard Tracfone uses Verizon's network and that seem to be the case since i noticed no difference in coverage Since I use my phone only for short calls and text the 1 year plan for $100 worked for me since 2016. But did not work for my wife, she ran out of minutes with a few months. As far I can tell this is Tracfone's last triple minutes phone. I heard they were phasing it out in 2017. And am surprised it is still available"
B00PWEN2ZE,Marlena Vanvalkenburgh,4,Battery life on this phone is one of the best I've ever encountered. Nice phone. Bought as Tracfone and was supposed to be the last of the 'triple minute' phones still available before being discontinued. Didn't get triple or even double minutes so I don't know what's up with that. One thing I don't like about phone it doesn't tell you if you have any texts/messages on the Home screen app icon. You have to go into the App to check. Not returning because I got a great deal and it's a nice phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Donna,5,"I am really happy with this phone. I have used tracfone for 15 years and this is by far the best one I have had. I love being able to use the WiFi so there are no charges off my time when I do emails, etc. This phone isn't even available at tracfone yet, so was really glad to get it at Amazon. It was super easy to transfer my 7000+ minutes and my year subscription to the new phone. Did it on their website which is much easier than using the telephone customer service because I have a difficult time when people don't speak good English and that is what you get a lot of on their customer service. So this was a good suprise and plan to keep this one for a long time. Found some really cool cases at Amazon and have ordered several for protection, etc."
B00PWEN2ZE,BoyMomx2,5,"As a mom, I went through that awful dilemma of what to give my son for his first phone. Ultimately I settled on this. He uses it only for emergencies but I feel much safer with him having it. Itâs not expensive to put the minutes on either. I had originally considered a flip phone but for this price, you couldnât go wrong!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Darrin D. Vernier,4,"This are solidly built and perform well. Despite being a few iterations of OS behind the most current standard they still perform admirably any task requested. I use these to run programs and have left several running multiple tasks 24/7 for weeks at a time and they just keep on doing what they are asked to do. All this for a fraction of the price of many phones of lesser quality. The main issue is the relatively poor quality of the fixed focal length camera. If, like me, you don't use the camera it's not a problem. If you do anticipate heavy camera use look elsewhere or use this as an additional phone. I bought my first last year, currently own six, and have yet to experience an issue with any of them. Only missing a star because of the camera but for my purposes they've been perfectly rock solid reliable."
B00PWEN2ZE,NikkiG,5,Great deal! At 20 bucks this was a steal. My 7 yr old broke his moto g and I happen to find this for dirt cheap. He only uses it for the WiFi to play games and watch movies. I won't be activating it at the moment but a brand new phone for my kid at this price was awesome. So much so we replaced out 5 yr old moto g with this one also. It works out better because this phone allows an SD card and the moto g did not.
B00PWEN2ZE,PNTHSE9900,5,"I purchased this Moto E Android Phone thru Amazon back in February and I've loved everything about it since activating it! I find it much more user-friendly than the other Samsung Android phone I had and I love it's features, color clarity and how well it fits in my clothing. Who says OLD people can't use technology? This makes it so much easier once you familiarlize yourself with the operation, features and what is possible with the Moto E."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bob,5,Extreme value. Phone works exactly as stated. Neither of us talk that much and most of our use is texting. Long live Tracfone! $7 a month is a lot better than $40-$70+ a month.Motorola Moto E Android Prepaid Phone with Triple Minutes (Tracfone)
B00PWEN2ZE,L. Bullock,3,"If I had reviewed this earlier, I would have given it four stars. It loses a star because I added a 32 gig card and then, three months or so into the life of the phone, the phone stopped ""seeing"" the card. Trying to get the phone to ""see"" the card again has been a nightmare and so I eventually gave up, living with the limitations of the decreased storage space. Of course, if anyone out there has any great ideas about how to go about getting the phone to ""see"" the card again, I'm all ears. This was a ""starter"" smartphone for me anyway, and it was cheap, so no real skin, as they say. Still, as for a recommendation, I'd suggest going with a more up to date phone than this. It's shelf-life is really short, unless you just want something extremely basic and I mean extremely."
B00PWEN2ZE,AJ,5,"This is the phone that finally liberated me from MagicJack. Within my household we've got four Tracfones (some bought directly through Tracfone, others like my iphone I brought over using the Bring Your Own Phone program), and we haven't had a single problem in all the years we've been with them.

I've also been using MagicJack for my home phone for several years now, and it was one headache after another. I was looking into other Voip options to replace it, but then realized I could just buy another tracfone and designate it as my home phone. I had my doubts about whether or not I'd be able to port my MagicJack phone number over (I read a few horror stories from people trying to get their numbers from MagicJack) but it was a breeze. I filled out the online form and waited the stated two days it might take to transfer over, and that was it. I entered the activation number, and my new Moto E is now receiving and making calls using my ported MagicJack number. It could not have been easier.

This phone is fantastic, but I'm actually going to pick up a Link2Cell cordless phone (this one:Â Panasonic Link2Cell Bluetooth Enabled Phone KX-TG7875S) tomorrow so I can have standard handsets throughout my home, but I'm actually thinking about upgrading one of my older tracfones with this one."
B00PWEN2ZE,L. J. Snider,5,"I searched Google for a ""smartphone that is easy for a senior citizen"" and this phone was among the recommendations. Since I had never used a smartphone, this was a great choice. It was easy to transfer from my flip phone which was also a Tracfone prepaid, and I am slowly ""getting it"". Motorola provides excellent online video how-tos to help whenever there is a question. It also is a good size - not too small and not too large, and the Corning glass screen stays really clean. I will probably never use even half the available functions, but it takes great pictures and has very good sound quality. And when purchased as a Tracfone I get 3X the data, text, and phone each time I purchase a card. I highly recommend!"
B00PWEN2ZE,RueMaxwell,5,"I bought this phone for my preteen to use for after school. Let me first say that it DOES work with safelink although it says on the package that it doesn't. I called Tracfone customer service and just simply told them I wanted to transfer my number to the new phone I just bought. They never asked if I was a safelink customer or mentioned safelink at all. Maybe it helped that the previous phone they gave me was a tracfone too. I'm not sure if that's normal for Safelink but thought I'd mention it here. Anyway, it took about 3 hours for the service to kick in but it works fine with calls, text and web surfing. Regular data is slow but we use wifi so it's pretty fast.

As far as the phone itself goes, it's awesome. Perfect for my son. There are plenty of apps to download like Netflix, Snapchat and YouTube and they all work great. I'm used to an iPhone 6 and have no complaints. It's a cool little android and definitely worth the price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pat,1,Bought for my sons birthday. I bought it end of June (26th) and tried to activate after his birthday (July 27th) and the phone won't turn on or charge. Log onto Amazon and the return window had closed. Manufacturer won't do anything either :/ so I'm just out 40$. Expensive paper weight and disappointed child.
B00PWEN2ZE,Em K,5,"The quality of this phone is great for me. I used to use BlackBerry devices that were given to me at work. For my simple needs the Moto E has a nice, bright and easy to see screen. The touch screen is very responsive. The general interface and ability to turn WiFi on and off easily is a plus. Camera picture quality is quite nice for the price. The quality of communication is good and I sometimes I am told I sound so clear! The price was right too."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kris,5,"This phone is great for kids! Both my 11 and 12 year old kids have this phone and its been very nice for them to have when going to and from school and when they are away from home. Motorola has an alert app where you get alerted when they leave or arrive somewhere, they also have skype for free that they use for a select few friends, and we also added an app that allows our family to communicate between each other for free. They've barely used their minutes using these features so its been very affordable. We have one phone set up for 100 mins a month and the other gets 80 mins and it costs less than 20 dollars a month. I'm very pleased with these phones and recommend them to anyone that have younger preteens that want their own phone. They go great with the case described as Moto E (1st Gen.) Case, ECâ¢ High Impact Rugged Armor Hybrid Holster Shockproof Case Cover with Kickstand + Belt Swivel Clip. the ASIN # is B016W5KVTQ. Love Love Love these phones."
B00PWEN2ZE,ROGER L MCCULLOUGH,5,"I've been using Tracfones for years. This is my first smart phone and I'm having a ball with it. I read review after review of this phone and am so happy I got it. This one cost me $99 and came with a 1 year card and 400 minutes which, with triple minutes, gave me 1200 minutes of talk, 1200 texts and 1200 mb of data. I couldn't find this deal when I ordered my wife the same phone so I paid $69 for it. Transferring the service and minutes on both phones was a snap and my wife ended up with more minutes than she'll ever use. Neither of us are heavy cell phone users (unlike some people who seem to spend more time on the phone than on real life).
My only complaint so far is that the battery doesn't seem to last as long as I had hoped, but then I have no basis of comparison with other smart phones. Maybe my experience is typical.
All in all, If I had to do it again I'd do the same thing."
B00PWEN2ZE,M. Shirey,5,"Great price and a great phone so far. added a 32gb sd and already familiar with android tablet not with phone service, so yeah, that's okay, slight learning curve. I am somewhat relunctant to use it for banking or other sensitive data applications where I could be snooped. But hey it's only money!

Caution, data minutes go fast. I had wifi set 'on' but not the correct data setting (thought I did, oh well) so in a few minutes I used over 100mb of my 1200 alloted. Ouchy. Under Wireless and Networking. More... uncheck mobile data enabled. If in doubt, the tracfone website has lovely robots that can assit you in chat (be patient).

Haven't tried Bluetooth yet (not sure if I will) and other than web browsing and email, wll works as expected. Good quality phone, hard to beat unless you spend considerably more, and over the long run (if your not a chatty Cathy on the phone). I should have minutes left over at year end, and the ability to use wifi calling via Google Hangouts Dialer will help make that magic happen. Should spend about 1/3 to 1/4 less than a contract phone annual expense.

I'm nothing if not thrifty."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michigan,5,"Really nice phone for the price, hard to believe you can purchase a smartphone like this for this price. does everything I need it to do. Still playing with it and I really like the voice activated messaging this has. Had a regular cell phone before this one, now my wife and I have one and we love The triple minutes through tracfone. Shipped fast and super price, works great, very happy with purchase, was able to keep my old phone no. and minutes too."
B00PWEN2ZE,Mary Ann,4,"I've had this phone for several months now. I use the basic features (phone, camera, text, internet) and it performs all quite well. I haven't been able to figure out how to zoom in when using the camera and am not even sure it will. I did learn after I purchased it that the battery is not replaceable so I'm hoping the one that came with it will last a good long time. It holds a charge for several days even if left on all the time. The screen is bright and crisp. It has many ring tones to choose from. After some help from Tracphone I was able to get some of the settings set correctly."
B00PWEN2ZE,DSM,4,"This is my first smart phone and I am learning as I go along. I have an ipad so I am familiar with touch screens and apps. The phone works well and is a nice size, not too big or small. The keyboard for texting is a little small for my fingers (and I have small hands), thank goodness for predictive text! I bought it because I have a tracfone but wanted to upgrade to a smart phone. This one is so much better than my flip phone. I sometimes have bad reception in some buildings, but talking to others in the same places I have found it is the buildings, not the phone. I have not found anything else wrong yet. This is not being used for posting to websites or surfing the web. I have the ipad for that. This is mainly used as a phone and to text family & friends. It works very well for that. I am pleased with my purchase and have recommended it to friends."
B00PWEN2ZE,Thom,4,"This phone is my first smart phone. I have had everything from a bag phone to a flip phone. I had avoided a smart phone until now.
The phone is easy to set up and operate. I found a caller ID app that provided an easy way to answer or ignore an incoming call so I am surprisingly happy with this phone.
I would recommend this phone as a transition step from a flip to a smart phone.
UPDATE 5-15-2017
I still like this phone. It is very easy to use. I am glad I chose this phone. Tracfone service is fine with me though I believe that I will add my minutes on line next time. I had a hard time understanding the service rep when I did it through the phone. The rep had a very heavy accent and I had to have her repeat things several times before I could understand her."
B00PWEN2ZE,Mansel,5,"I prefer products that do what I ask them to do without having a lot of tech I either can't or won't use. However, I must admit this phone is quite an improvement over my last phone. The voice sound quality is superior, the ease of entering contacts is better, and the calls themselves are being handled more deftly. It also allows calendar inputs for appointments with reminders. So, it more than meets my expectations. The seller proved to be efficient and got the phone shipped and delivered somewhat ahead of schedule. Another plus but I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks so I cannot speak to durability. If similar to Motorola products I've had in the past, I think it will be around for awhile."
B00PWEN2ZE,P. Perkins,4,"This is a first generation Moto E with only 4GB of built-in storage, which is tiny by Android phone standards. It comes with KitKat 4.4.4 and does not offer any OTA upgrade to a newer release. It may be possible to upgrade the OS, but I'd be afraid the result would be constantly running out of space on the device. Even on KitKat, I've installed a 32 GB microSD card and laboriously moved everything possible to the SD card to preserve scarce internal storage space. As for transferring minutes / days / number from my old phone, for once I was able to get there without having to call the TracFone 800 number and wait on hold. But the web site waited until I clicked ""Do the transfer"" before it saw fit to mention that getting ready for me to try to activate the phone might take a couple of days, and the signal that they were ready would be that my old phone would suddenly stop working."
B00PWEN2ZE,Shelly R,5,"Okay so here's the deal. My son loves music. He's 8 years old and he also enjoys going to the YMCA and doing the kids fitness program. I could not afford an iPod Touch or iPod Shuffle and pay for all the music he wanted from there. At the YMCA there is Wi-Fi and at home there is Wi-Fi and he's able to use YouTube and Pandora and I don't have to put minutes on it or allow data or let him call. There are a few of the features available, some minutes, some texts but for the most part it's a smaller device than his tablet that he is able to take to the gym and listen to his music. I think it worked out great."
B00PWEN2ZE,SPARKY,4,"Just got a few days ago and after set up , I am impressed,,,Nice size and feel to it, especially with the "" Tank "" cover on...Screen is very clear and bright, doesn't fade totally in the sun and has very good angle viewing...I like the front speaker, about time, but not that loud at the highest setting for speaker phone use,, plenty loud though for video's, alarms, ringtones, etc...,so can't understand that...main use for a phone is to talk......The camera takes fairly nice pix quickly, and that's what you want ,,after all a cell phone is not a camera ,its for communication, like some complain about the quality or no front lens for ""selfie"" garbage.....Other thing is the apps needed for the time and minutes remaining,, should be like older tracfones, showed all the time, and you don't get the bonus minutes either when adding more...The sealed battery might be a problem down the road, time will tell.....Overall, I like it a lot ..like a small tablet with you for internet on the go, with or without Wi-Fi...."
B00PWEN2ZE,A. Arthur,5,"This is a great little phone! I use Google Voice along with my Tracfone account for free VOIP phone calls when I'm home or have a WiFI connection, so it's a very economical smart phone setup. I don't like to receive phone calls when I'm out and about, so it works out pretty well. I'm surprised at how much I use the built in FM radio, which is an added bonus. The Android interface is very peppy and responsive. I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't need a selfie cam, and who doesn't talk on the phone much when they're not at home."
B00PWEN2ZE,Diane Dyar,4,"I bought 2 of these phones for myself and my husband in August 2016. They work fine for the most part but mine lost all my pictures in the photo gallery .One day they were just gone and no way to get them back . Even the ones on the extra card I installed had disappeared . I tried everything I could find online to no avail.Tracfone said they couldnt help either. So if you have one of these phones ,be sure to download your photos to a flash drive frequently.Then the speaker on my husbands phone stopped working and the only way he can use it is to put it on speaker phone.(so much for privacy) The price on these phones was great (29.99 each with free shipping) and since we had never had a smart phone before ,we thought these would be a good learning tool and they have been for the most part , but now we are looking to replace them because of these two problems that evidently can't be fixed."
B00PWEN2ZE,michelle heil,4,"I bought this phone strictly to use as a wifi *tablet* to replace the tablet my son broke. My son has a habit of breaking tablets but not phones, so i ordered this so he could watch youtube videos on it and apps. While its not an expensive phone, it does the trick. Only thing that is annoying that everytime i turn it on, activate phone comes on but i can press a button to get off that. I strictly use it with my wifi. It loads pages fast and easy to use. I recommend it. I can't activate the phone though because it says it won't activate. But it is still usable.....minus the having to get off the activate screen every time i turn it on. Its quite loud too. Its definitely worth 30 bucks. But if you want a lot of memory, buy another phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pamela Guzzino,5,"My husband is whit I will call a techno- phobe. No smart phone, loves his flip phone. Purchased this for him when his flip phone died. He likes it. Simple to use, does all that he needs ( call, text) . Could do a lot more but he chooses to ignore that option.

Who cares about the memory or the games you can play? Get a bigger phone for that. Use this one to give the number for work or anyone that you don't want to have your ""main"" phone number. It does everything you need it to do, and looks sharp while you're using it. Not good for data, unless you use wifi, as that will eat up your minutes. Use this one for what a phone is meant for: calling and texting."
B00PWEN2ZE,Heather,4,"the phone itself is a good phone. The tracfone service i purchased this phone for is OK..... IF YOU ARE NOT GOING ONLINE OR SENDING FILES. The phone service/talk time and texting is good. Just like any other cell phone service. BUT when i need to send DATA a photo, go online, email it never works. I NEVER Play games/ or download any apps. I leave the phone pretty basic. When i get back to my house i log into my wifi that is the only time sending data works. SO if you want this tracfone MOTO E for browsing the internet while you are out and about, sending photos, emails ect. I suggest looking for another carrier. I will be handing this down to my daughter in the next couple of weeks. On to the next i guess."
B00PWEN2ZE,dbringle,5,"This is my first experience with a smart phone and I really like it! Have used Tracfone a lot in the past and really enjoy the low payments and how you control your bill. This phone is really nice, however does not come with any minutes or airtime, only the phone, but it is easy enough to go on their website and add what you need. I mainly got it to receive texts for work and this will work great for that and so much more. So much better than signing up for a contract with a cell company and paying way more per month! An upgrade from my flip phone. Nice weight and size. It will take some getting used to for talking. One little issue is that the charger is really hard to plug into the phone for some reason, I felt like I was going to mess something up when I first did it.
I had paid for one day shipping, then had some issues with that. Deliverer said it had been delivered when it had not, then I found it the next morning. Amazon was great at returning the one day shipping cost."
B00PWEN2ZE,Stacey Lee,4,"I've had this phone for just over a year now. It has been a great phone. My husband & I both use Tracfone but have different brand phones. I have to say that there is something about a Motorola that gets better service than other models. My previous phone was also a Motorola and had better service as well. I use it a lot for facebook messaging, it works great for that. I do have to say that after all this time my bluetooth seems to be malfunctioning. Some days it'll sync up with my car & vivofit and other days I have to turn the phone off and restart it in order to get the bluetooth to co-operate. There are also times that people try to call me and my phone will start to vibrate and won't stop and I am unable to answer the call until I turn it off and restart it. So I may be looking for a new one soon, but Motorola Tracfones are hard to find and I've had the Motorola brand for about 10 years and love the quality of service from the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Steve Perkins,5,"After breaking an expensive phone in the gym, I bought this to use as a media player when working out or driving. I never even activated the actual ""phone"" part (there's nothing requiring you to).

Works great for the desired purpose. Spotify and Amazon Music both let you download thousands of playlist songs while you're on wi-fi, so they'll be available on the go even without a phone data plan. Same for podcasts, of course.

With a cheap case, this this is pretty much indestructible... and performs just as well as an iPod Touch that cost hundreds of dollars not too long ago."
B00PWEN2ZE,Anne Staff,5,"My wife and I both upgraded to the Moto e. We have had the devices for 4 months. Very little data use, Mostly text use and occasional calls. The fact that separate Text and data refill cards are available is a giant plus. The speech to text feature is also a big plus. These phones are on Verizon network which seems to have better coverage then our older trafones that were on ATT. Very pleased with the phones."
B00PWEN2ZE,Smoggy66,5,"I bought this phone for my sister who had to upgrade. I felt this was a good phone for her and there is little bloatware on the phone. It's fast, but only has a out facing camera, but she's not one to take a ""selfie"", so didn't figure this would be an issue. Got the phone and disabled some of the apps I knew she would never use. Bought a closed case for it so the front would stay nice. Very nice Tracfone and got some really good reviews on the Tech sites. For the price it's a no brainer because if she hates the phone she can get another one just as cheap. I have a Moto G and this phone is almost the same size and is really a nice phone to introduce an older person to the ""smart"" phone arena."
B00PWEN2ZE,Brenda Rohlman,5,This phone is awesome for the $! My minutes/airtime not only transferred instantly online-I had 900 minutes on my old tracfone and they gave me 900 minutes+900 texts+900 data web!! You do need to charge your battery if it is low when it comes before you can transfer your old number-airtime & minutes. I've been a tracfone customer for over 10 years and prices and ease of adding online is just awesome!
B00PWEN2ZE,JRM,5,"For JRM, texting and receiving occasional photos, are my only preferences. Currently only $5 for an additional 1000 texts too!
In summary: "" A $19.99 Smart Phone, Sure Smart to own! "" And Thank you Amazon, for the remarkably super quick delivery!"
B00PWEN2ZE,JC,3,"If it had more than 2G internal memory, it would be a perfect phone. As is, i have trouble with the number of apps i can have installed - even when i move them to the external card. Its so good otherwise, i would recommend to anyone who does not need a lot of apps or the kind that cannot store their data on external drives - so be careful."
B00PWEN2ZE,Henry,5,"Bought two, one for me and one for my wife. First REAL smart phone we have had. We really like them. We have had them for a couple of months now and are still learning how versatile they really are. I love the fact that I DON'T have to type, just talk to it and the text appears!!!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Muddymike,5,"Gotta say I bought this phone as a backup for my Samsung but after using it for a month now I like it better than my old Samsung cell phone I sort of put through the washing machine by mistake..oops. Battery seems to hold a longer charge but I do not use it too much either but for incoming calls mostly for a small business. Came with an activation card and a couple chargers which my replacement Samsung did not... Works very good in the boonies or sticks, country folks."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"Personally, I love the way that this phone is set up, so simple and easy to use without all the immoral garbage on it that the more popular smartphones seem to be inundated with. The only reason for a 4 star rating, was that I purchased the same model this January 2017. And I had to replace it only 5 months later, in June 2017, because the screen froze black. The phone repair shop I contacted said that materials and labor would cost me roughly $125.00...... So I decided to buy the same model again, because my mom, older sister and younger brother have all had theirs for a while, and never really had any problems with theirs. So, hopefully this is helpful to whoever reads this. :-)"
B00PWEN2ZE,S.S.,5,"Although I've never owned an Android phone before this, I found the phone easier to use than I thought. Once I had the battery charged and turned the phone on for the first time, I found that the set-up process went very smoothly. And I was able to easily transfer my service on TracFone from my old handset to this one, and also was easily able to transfer my contact list to this handset from my old one. A friend of mine who has a Android phone explained to me how to get apps for this phone from the Google Play store which also was easy to navigate from the phone. The sound quality of the phone was very good, and when using the phones data or a Wi-Fi connection to access web sites it loaded fast with little or no lag time. And the battery lasts for a good while between charge ups. To sum it all up, for those like myself who are Android newbies this is a very good first phone to try before trying something more advanced. Very good and might I add durable product."
B00PWEN2ZE,P Regul,5,"I gave this as a gift to someone I know is homeless and this will make it so much easier for her and her kid. When she adds minutes, it will triple them. The tears in her eyes of joy just made it worth it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Prolific Procreator,5,"I'll start by saying my first smart phone experience was the Tracfone ZTE Valet, two of them in fact. At the time it seemed to be the best that Tracfone had to offer. Maybe I got a couple of lemons, but they were disappointing as smart phones, and just as phones. I used the screen going intermittent as an excuse to buy something new. I found the Motorola on Amazon for $50. It had better specs and good reviews so I took a chance.

So far, this phone is far superior in every way. The WiFi works great, 3G is good too. Phone function is fine. It is responsive and apps don't crash every two minutes. The only disadvantage is that I tend to leave the 3G on and I use a lot more data than I used to when I'm not in WiFi range. It's not as easy to turn the 3G off as it was with the Valet. But that's ok. I haven't had to buy airtime or data yet."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jay,4,"I got it as my first phone, and it really is a GREAT starter phone! The front camera quality is surprisingly good, it never lagged for me, and it played games like a champ, as well as music, YouTube videos and movie streaming!

My 2 complaints is one, there isn't a lot of storage on the phone, so I would recommend that you buy an SD card for extra G's of storage. Two, there isn't a selfie camera.

Overall, it's a solid phone for a great price, and TracFone offers pretty good service."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michael C.,5,"Works well but gets only minor use. I realize some people live on or with the phone, we do not. It takes decent pictures, does not lock up and has crystal clear sound. Easy set-up and had no problems with getting Tracfone number and account"
B00PWEN2ZE,-,1,"terrible customer service
Motorola will not honor their one year warranty, says its a third party phone, buyer beware!!!
also a big run around with customer service reps, can't believe the lack of service.
crappy service, bad company"
B00PWEN2ZE,JK,5,"Update: If I were to buy this phone again, I'd consider the slightly more expensiveÂ LG Destiny 4G Android Prepaid Phone with Triple Minutes (Tracfone), with very similar specs, except that it has 8GB built-in storage instead of 2GB and runs a less-dusty version of Android (5.0 vs. 4.4). The extra storage would mean not having to deal with moving apps to the SD card right away, and the newer version of Android would be nice too. Still, I am extremely happy with the Moto E, and it has an FM radio, which the LG maybe doesn't have.

This phone is amazing for the price. I bought it because I go walking in the evening after work, and want to track my steps and have my music, and was getting uncomfortable with carrying my spendy iPhone, which I could easily end up dropping and breaking or losing in the dark. So I looked for a cheap MP3 player that wouldn't be a huge loss if something happened to it, and stumbled across this phone.

I DID NOT activate it. It is possible to skip past the activation steps in the initial setup. What I did instead was to set up a free phone number under Google Voice, and tie texts to it through Google Hangouts Chat, so that this is a fully functional phone when around wifi, all for zero dollars upfront, with no monthly service payments.

I also bought a $10 microSD card, 32 GB--the largest size this phone supports--and used the iSync app to copy all my playlists and tunes to the phone+card. I now have a *very* nice MP3 player that also tracks my walks (with the built-in GPS, which does not need phone activation to work and the free UnderArmor 'track my walk' app), uses bluetooth earbuds for a tangle-free music experience, and which sips its battery when not out walking.

The phone includes an FM radio which works pretty well, but it refuses to work unless you have earbuds plugged in because it uses the wires as an antenna. Since I don't use wired earbuds, this is frustrating, as it would be nice to listen to the radio sometimes while walking.

I also have an old Tracfone 'dumbphone' that I keep around for emergencies, which cost $7 up front and $20 every 3 months to keep active (and is another fantastic deal for the price). I am seriously considering moving my dumbphone's number to this phone, so that it is a true phone all the time, and I can make an emergeny call if need be while out walking.

Downsides: Compared to the iPhone, it's a bit less snappy / responsive, but still completely usable. The camera is pretty sucky, but not horrible, it works. All the Google services are amazing, but also a bit clunky compared to the 'just works' iPhone equivalents, and the phone is stuck on a pretty old and clunky (4.4) version of Android. It seems like some app or something needs updating (and Google Play needs to update too) every time I use the phone. The phone has only has 2 GB of internal storage, so you need to use an app manager to move apps to the microSD card or you'll run out of app storage space right away. Still, it compares surprisingly well to the iPhone, especially considering that the iPhone costs about 20 times as much.

Since it runs an old version of Android, it's probably a huge security hole, so it's best to not use any real personal information when setting it up.

Overall, for $35 total cost including the 32GB microSD card, I couldn't be happier with this phone. It's like an iPod touch on steroids for a tiny fraction of the iPod's price."
B00PWEN2ZE,rnbiker,5,"So far I like the phone very much. First real smart phone I've ever had. Only two real complaints. First the internal memory is very limited and is practically full after only downloading Facebook and YouTube APP onto the phone. Second is the camera, takes good pictures but very limited on functions does not even have a flash. Have thought of upgrading to a newer more advanced version but this seems to be the only Motorola product that TRACFONE currently uses and I don't like the other Android phones they offer."
B00PWEN2ZE,Gary L,4,"I like this phone a lot. Tracfone is getting some true smart phones in their offerings and this one is a big leap forward from my Samsung Galaxy Centura. Transferring service, phone number and all my apps was easy and worked great. This Moto E is fast processing and the web pages load quickly. I think this phone will service me for quite a while to come. Would buy it again."
B00PWEN2ZE,Ray in CO,5,"Couldn't be happier. $20. I use TRACFONE for telephone. Tracfone has internet time but I prefer to connect it to my wifi at my home. Plenty of bells and whistles. Loaded it with cool free apps. I listen to radio wifi programs. It takes great pics and nice video. It's bright, clear and colorful even with my old man vision."
B00PWEN2ZE,Johnny T,1,"Phone burst into flames when plugged in charging, 11 months after purchase. Called Tracfone under the 1 year warranty and they tell me warranty does not cover the phone bursting into flames."
B00PWEN2ZE,Henry J.,5,"This is my first smart phone. It is fast, capable, and just the right size. The screen is easy to read - even without my reading glasses. This phone is a great value especially when you consider TracFone's service pricing. I'm usually close to a secure Wi-Fi connection so I don't need to use the 3G connection very often, but it's there when I need it. I'm able to invest the savings from typical cell phone plans in fast Internet access with a back-up provider and state-of-the art digital home telephone service. It's nice to have three communication options. If one is down, we have two backups. My teenage daughter has one of these phones and she loves it too! My son has a Moto G. He loves the latest and greatest technology. He is very impressed with both the Moto G and Moto E."
B00PWEN2ZE,Yvonne Auxier,3,"ALERT I purchased this phone on June 16 of 2015, it was terrific. I had to purchase another phone on June 16 2016 when it wouldn't communicate with satellite for GPS any longer without a wifi or ""hotspot"" within immediate vicinity. It is now Nov 9 2016, and my second phone just did the same thing. Even after resetting, and following tech support instructions, both phones failed in the same way. Otherwise, I really loved this little phone, but unless they agree to replace it, I'm going for the one I bought for my son, which was an LG Tracfone with more storage, for about 30 dollars more."
B00PWEN2ZE,Elizabeth,5,"I received the product on the day it was send to arrive. I've been using it since Thursday and only had to charge it once. It runs fast, the screen looks great, and games look great. I still haven't activated it with tracfone because I don't have a minutes card so I'm not sure how good text phone and data is but it works great on wifi. I would actually recommend this!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Wendy Higginbotham,3,"I don't know if it's just me and I'm not figuring it out right but I cant find a ""call log"" and I don't get an icon when I get a text. The little green speech bubble on my old phone would show a waiting text. This does not and I miss texts if I don't constantly check it. It gets a good signal and I use it for when I'm out of the house and texting only. I have a landline for most calls."
B00PWEN2ZE,Matvei,3,"Worked fine for me...till it didn't. Then one day Uber/Lyft stopped working and the battery stopped holding a charge for more than a few hours. Now it's just a cell phone I'm using till I switch to a proper smart phone. Unless you hardly do anything with your phone, avoid this. If you don't do much, it's a great deal, though. Nice camera. Good phone quality."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kerry,5,Really enjoying this new phone. An inexpensive way to own a decent smart phone that does a lot. Glad I got it. Also glad I didn't pay full price for it on the Tracfone website! Amazon had a much bettter deal.
B00PWEN2ZE,Jerry,5,"First the cons. For the people who never read the product description,It is a TracFone,you cannot unlock it,change sim cards or do anything else to it. It will not run on anything other than Tracfone's network. Next, it does not have forward facing camera or a rear flash. No selfies for you ! Internal storage on this phone sucks,only 3 gb. You'll need a Micro-sim card if you want to stuff it with apps,music and pics.
Now for the good stuff. The was Motorola's entry level smart phone back in 2014 when it came out and it got great reviews. Today if your not a power user this is still a good phone. Build quality is great and it feels good in the hand. Screen is nice and bright and the colors are great! It runs all the apps I've installed without any problem. Wi-fi and phone reception is great also. I live in a small valley and sometimes cell reception is the pits but I've had no problem so far. The phone runs 4.4.4 Kit Kat but can be upgraded to 5.0 Marshmallow according to Motorola's web site but I've not tried it.
All in all your not going to beat this for a $20 bill !"
B00PWEN2ZE,Victoria,4,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that photos aren't always clear. Could be because of the photographer. I had one of these before I drove my car over it. Went to an LG. Didn't like that one at all. Ditched that one, and found the Moto E on line for dirt cheap. A much better phone all the way around."
B00PWEN2ZE,Rutzup,5,"I love this phone. It does everything I thought it would and more. I have seen reviews stating people can not load apps to the SD card. I have not had a problem doing that. Some apps I can not move to the SD card and I do uninstall them and find another app that I can move to the SD card or installs on the SD card. I can even have the app data store on the SD card as well.
This phone is far superior to the Samsung Galaxy. I am glad I switched phones."
B00PWEN2ZE,Stef Butterflies,5,Motorola Moto E 1st Generation. Glad I was searching for the phone when I did because i paid less than $50 for it and a week later price went up. Love my new Tracfone. Got rid of US Cellular bill every month and got this great deal. Loving the Triple minutes feature. I never used 600 minutes a month of talk or text before so I know It will last awhile for me. So when you add a 200 minute card for $39.99 it gets tripled. Awesome. Will be saving money in the next few months.
B00PWEN2ZE,reneejt,1,"The phone is as described. I was excited to move up to a smartphone and if you do not need help from tracfone it might be a good phone. I needed technical help from tracfone getting set up. These people are terrible,after several calls to them I still have a phone that is incomplete. All I am trying to access my voicemail and it seems to be out of their expertise to help"
B00PWEN2ZE,Mike B,4,"I've had it about a week, and so far, I'm very pleased with this phone. It works, unlike the crappy ZTE I upgraded from. Should have done it long ago. Not nearly as much glare in the sunlight either, and it's super-fast on FaceBook. Just be sure to download a decent power control widget, such as ""Power Toggles"", so you can easily turn the 3g data off, or you'll breeze through your data in no time. For some reason, the control widget that came installed doesn't have that option on it. I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars yet, but if it stays reliable over time, I'll definitely bump it up one."
B00PWEN2ZE,Star7*,5,"This is the first smart phone I've owned. I found it easy to start using for the basics. Still learning more.
The only thing I did not like is that it's set to let every app work automatically in the background.
I had to disable all sorts of things as it was silently gulping up data usage at times when I was not
by a wifi connection. So far I'm happy with it, it seems very sturdy and the gorilla glass cleans up in a snap."
B00PWEN2ZE,Stephanie Marie Ackley,5,Santa got these for my 8 year old Twin daughters for Christmas. They just use the wifi for games and we downloaded a texting app so they can text me or Dad. These phones were great! They didn't come with a sim card though which I thought they did. Such an amazing deal for $20 then we bought them phone cases. Probably the cheapest and most loved Santa present ever! It's really easy to bypass the activation part and just connect to wifi.
B00PWEN2ZE,Beach Gal,5,I have had the phone for almost two years now and LOVE it. I am 73 years old and somewhat electronic litterate and set it up bu myself with no problems. I us it with Tracfone and find it very economical. I just bought a second one as a back up.
B00PWEN2ZE,Joe Video,5,"Bought 3 of these for the family. We were not disappointed. We upgraded from an LG840 Tracphone, and what a pleasant experience. This Moto E (gen 1) phone comes with triple minutes, triple texts, and triple data. Just a touch larger than an iPhone 4. You can limit your data usage to WiFi if you want. Memory is also expandable from the 4 Gig internal to an additional 32 Gig on a SDHC card. This is a definite buy recommendation!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Kip Deeds,4,"The head phone outlet does not work great, I can't keep the jack in place. The memory is small. Don't expect to store too many apps. I have found that the micro SD card will accept certain apps and not others. This makes it hard to add too many features. For basic usage, checking email and social media it works great. The screen is sharp and clear. I also like the sleep and alarm features."
B00PWEN2ZE,O.C. Hardesty,5,"I've been a Tracfone user for many years, using a flip type phone that served it's purpose. But I've always wanted one that had a camera, so when this was offered at such an affordable price, I couldn't pass it up. The learning curve of an android phone is a bit daunting, but now with not only a camera and so much more at my disposal, I feel more in touch with things around me. And transferring my minutes and phone number was super easy."
B00PWEN2ZE,W.H.,5,Works great for basic internet mail and phone. Meets my needs very well. If you don't need an overpriced cell phone and just want the basics for everyday use I recommend this phone. Connects to wifi very quickly.So far I have not experienced any problems with this phone. Considering what I paid { $20} I am very pleased.
B00PWEN2ZE,vss,4,The first one I got came with a completely dead battery that would not take a charge. The replacement also came with a completely dead battery but did take a charge. After six months of use I haven't had any battery issues and everything works fine. For the price I'm very pleased.
B00PWEN2ZE,A. Jones,5,Works great and love the service from TracFone. I highly recommend it if you are not a game player and just need a phone with text and internet access.
B00PWEN2ZE,Sosagirl24,3,"Bought it because I searched Safelink compatible phones and this popped up. Should be listed in description as ""Not Safelink compatible"""
B00PWEN2ZE,Ann,5,"This my first android, it's nice and light. I use it for emergency I'm one who's not on the phone all day. With this I
can check the weather when I'm out and about, check prices, and here and there make a call. I usually keep
my cell phones 10 plus years. I'm not new to cell phones...been using them for at least 27 yrs."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"Good Loud sound, speaker is on the front where it should be. The phone also has small light on the front that flashes to show a missed call or message. Battery lasts about 12 days of light use 8 to 10 with medium use. Very good phone. I Would rate it 12 on a 1 to 10 scale."
B00PWEN2ZE,Austin,5,The phone itself is really nice for the price. Sleek and has a black matte look to it. The phone cards for these are also reasonably priced and you can get them on yhr Tracfone website or even at most grocery stores. I was able to connect to my Wi-Fi no problem. The colors were vibrant and the camera was decent. Easy to set up. But know that this phone is not Safelink compatible. I didn't know until it came and it said it on the box itself. Speakers and sound were clear and reception is good.
B00PWEN2ZE,Glenn W. Kreuscher,5,"So far so good. Good wifi. Telephone is great. I use this with wifi, seldom with roaming 3G, but everyone has wifi and it is fast. The only drawback is that it is hard to see in the daylight. With wifi in hotels and other places that have approval screens, you need to enter the internet with yahoo or some other non google entry. The battery is good. The ability to have a 32G micro card makes it easy to download video, photos and music. The size is just right. Camera is 5G, which is adequate for my needs."
B00PWEN2ZE,Patti,5,"I was very hesitant about getting a smart phone, but after reading many positive reviews helped me decide to upgrade from a basic, no frills phone. I'm not a techie and don't spend much time on a phone, and w/ the triple minutes, this seems like a perfect phone for me. Also, I'm pleasantly surprised how relatively user-friendly it is. I've not used the camera yet, but if I want to take a lot of quality pictures, I'll use a camera."
B00PWEN2ZE,Vince8,5,"This is a great phone for most people. Its not an IPhone. Not the best that can be bought. But, If you want a smart phone at a great price, this is the phone for you. Easy to use, nice screen. Although it is only 3G, it is very fast in my opinion. As others have noted in their reviews, this is a perfect phone for those of us who are not into ""keeping up with the jones""."
B00PWEN2ZE,Stiglitz,4,"Honestly, I haven't completely decided yet. When I first got it there were too many apps for me and it drained my phone too fast. I couldn't figure out how to stop the programs that were draining my phone. Once I reset it, the battery drained slower and I had just a few apps I use. If it stays like this, I'll give it five stars. Right now 3-4."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"I has a Moto X with a different carrier. The only thing I really miss is this thing doesn't have a camera flash. But I knew that when I bought this one at Â¼ the price, so I'll still give it 5 stars. In reality there's very little difference, but this one feels a tad thicker because the X was more curved. Sure it's smaller, but bigger is not always better. Forget the bragging rights, Moto and Android have come so far, today's basic smartphone ain't dumb!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Casey Woodson,3,"Excellent phone!!! But. The Corning gorilla glass scratches EXTREMELY easy. I wonder if it is in fact
glass. I suspect that it is just a tough plastic. Plus, there is NO Wi-Fi hotspot feature on this phone
as stated multiple times."
B00PWEN2ZE,Daydreamer,5,Dont drop it. My daughter just had to replace hers (with the same phone since she loves it) because the one time it fell it developed a odd spot in the screen from there it was downhill. During the year she had it thow it was great which is why she bought the same one with a difrent case hoping it will provide better protection.
B00PWEN2ZE,Linda Lou,5,"Wonderful phone and much easier to use than I thought. Easier and less expensive than my previous carrier T-Mobile, who's prices continued to go up, and it wasn't until I decided to leave them that they offered me a plan that was less. I had some bumps in the road with TracFone from a prior purchase, but I am now getting good service and at a price that is affordable."
B00PWEN2ZE,Mommyof8,5,"My husband bought this phone for me for our last anniversary, and when my father needed a new phone, I purchased this model for him as an early Father's Day gift. We both love how easy it is to operate, once you learn all of the features. The more I use my phone the more I like it. The camera takes great pictures as well."
B00PWEN2ZE,Susan Dennie,4,"We have given and upgraded Tracfones for our elderly parents for many years and this is by far the nicest and easiet for them to use. We would recommend it for someone who is not looking for the latest and greatest in terms of data usage, texting, photo taking etc. although it does all that. We just wanted them to have a phone for peace of mind when traveling etc. As always, read the reviews. This one had good reviews and was inexpensive."
B00PWEN2ZE,Happy Customer,4,Good phone for the price only drawback is it does not have the dual camera.
B00PWEN2ZE,Bard Medicine,1,"The speaker stopped working after a few days. This is a common problem with the phone. Search Moto E no sound. If you tap the top of the phone, the sound will pop on and off, so it's a physical connection issue."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,5,"I have used Tracfone for a long time and the Motorola Moto E is finally a phone that does everything I need when I need it. No lag, good pictures, and a great price. I bought it on Amazon for about half the price anywhere else. It is worth every penny. Goodbye Samsung!!#"
B00PWEN2ZE,Racheal,5,I purchased this phone for my tween daughter and she loves it! Its the perfect phone for her to have when she has to stay after school. Its fast has reasonable storage space for apps and games. Downfall is it does not have a front facing camera but the back camera takes pretty nice pictures. It is a really nice little phone. I also purchased one of the cute cases that they sell for the Moto-E and its just a perfect fit for my daughter.
B00PWEN2ZE,benita rouse,5,My son is in love with this phone. He picked it and I ordered it for him. he is on it all the time and he got familiar with it fast. I bought one weeks ago and sent it back because it would not charge. It was my fault. You have to give it a little time 15 to 20 minutes and then you will see it start charging. really nice phone for the money.
B00PWEN2ZE,JJP Sarasota,5,"After years of paying $70 or $80 dollars a month this phone is the bargain of the year. Using Tracfone's annual data my phone is now costing me about $10 or $15 a month and its works as good as any of the IPhone's or Android phones we have ever had. This is a great alternative, and Android love all of our Google apps, email and calendar."
B00PWEN2ZE,Marke,5,"I really like this phone. The interface is quite fast and not bogged down with unnecessary junk. The Wi-Fi reception is better than I expected, and is very useful for voip. Also purchased a Samsung EVO SD card, which pairs with it nicely. A great inexpensive little phone that won't destroy your soul if you break it or lose it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert Marxhausen,1,"I read a lot of good reviews about it and bought it and got it fast. However, when I tried to get the service with Tracfone the problems started. I tried pushing the buttons to get it to work and the screen came on in Spanish. The tech on the phone told me to open the back and take out the battery. It was difficult but I finally got the back open. The battery was big and I could not see how to take out the battery. The tech read some more on the phone and then told me the battery does not come out. I told him that I wanted to cancel the service and he then told me that I had to find someone that speaks Spanish. I insisted that he cancel the service and refund my credit card. He got a supervisor on the line and she was sane and told me that she gave me the refund. She probably did but I will check my next credit card bill to be sure.
I am buying a non-smart phone and will try the Tracfone service with that one. I do not want one untrained tech to turn me sour on Tracfone. I sent the phone back to Amazon and they refunded me."
B00PWEN2ZE,DG,5,Great cheap phone. I only use it for basic tasks such as texting and talking. I works well.
B00PWEN2ZE,SG,4,"Excellent price. Phone is ok, but not a lot of memory. I added an SD card, and it helped somewhat, but as with all Android phones, I can't get rid of the Google programs I don't use without going deep into techie land."
B00PWEN2ZE,Vicky Allen,5,"I bought this phone awhile ago, and wanted to wait to leave the review, till I really have tried it out for awhile. Well I just have to say I Love It. It is so easy to use, The separation of the text, talk, data makes it so easy to watch your usage and makes your minutes last longer. The features are really easy to use. Downloading apps are really easy to do. I just love it and highly recommend it."
B00PWEN2ZE,RAS,4,Very happy with this phone. To me compared to my past phone this phone is pretty darn near nice smart phone. Actually bought 2. One for my wife and one for me. My previous LG phone was horribly slow. This one actually works. It is generation 1 in the Moto E line. But that is OK by me. Does all that I want from a phone. And the price was great at 49 bucks. Not a bad camera either. Put a large sd card in it and am good to go for a while!
B00PWEN2ZE,Rachel,5,"This is my first smart phone. My old phone could call/text, nothing else. This is a HUGE change. It's been fun learning what all it can do. I've had no troubles so far. Bought one for my husband too & he said the FM radio app doesn't work very well. My battery only lasts 2 or 3 days, even if I don't use the phone. I have to constantly remind myself to charge it. It's taken a little time to learn to use but it's been fun."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bruce cameron,5,"bought 2 one for me one for my lady,we had old hello good by phones so it took us a while to figure eveything out but now lov it only wish it had a recorder so i could put my own ring tones on like my other phone ,still learning some stuff,for a not tec person an older folks i think this is a good phone,i don`t do all the downloads an games it`s just a nice low tec phone ,for the price an being on verizon for me works"
B00PWEN2ZE,Dennis,5,"It met my expectations 100%. I received it on-time and was able to transfer my phone number, minutes, data, and texts from my old Moto E that I had dropped in water to this new phone without a hiccup! It was absolutely fantastic! I love this little phone! I wish it had more memory, but I'll get one that does when I have more money in the future. Until then, this one will be just fine!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Rojo in Mo,4,"Phone may be a little dated. Instructions on use, useless. I'm an old guy, and I have trouble figuring out things. A little help would be appreciated. Tracfones tutorial helps, but does not explain even the simple thing I wish to do, like set, . alarms. really have to dig for info. Otherwise, good phone, but have to charge battery every 2 days. It works for me, but instructions are a little vague."
B00PWEN2ZE,James Doyle,5,"First of all I would like to say the Motorola Motto is the
nicest phone I ever owned.
I purchased the Motorola from Shopcelldeals fulfilled
by Amazon.
I owned many tracfones and even an iPhone 4 and
the Motorola Motto is a nicer phone.
Its quite an upgrade from the LG Optimus Dynamic.
The screen is 4.3 a larger screen than my other
Phones and another reason I like it and a speaker
on the front and sounds real good.
The batter lasts about 8hrs and the phone looks
Expensive you would say it cost $400.00.
I paid $79.00 for it and had the phone for 3 days.
I like it so much I will be purchasing another one."
B00PWEN2ZE,Grandpa of 11,5,Love this phone. Got it at an incredible price and it has everything I need. The phone quality is very good and has all that I need for a smartphone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Josh A.,5,I bought it just to use it for some wireless/Bluetooth issues (not as an actual 'phone'); device seems solid and runs a variety of apps I needed to run (both old & new) Works well; hasn't crashed; for a cheap smartphone it's worth the $.
B00PWEN2ZE,Mary,5,"I like this phone, camera quality is good, sound quality is good. I bought the Tracfone lg LTE and I'm returning it for another Tracfone moto e. I dropped my 1st moto e, I like it a lot better than the Tracfone lg LTE even though that phone is more up to date. The features on the moto e are much better to Me.ð"
B00PWEN2ZE,J Stahl,5,"Arrived on time through Amazon Prime. Phone has nice display. Kit Kat OS. Using on Tracfone/Veizon. All going well. Phone is simple by today's standards but was bought for someone who had been using a 2g flip phone. No front camera seems a little strange, even a VGA would have been ok. Good first smart phone at a great price."
B00PWEN2ZE,lillian oler,4,"This is a great stater phone! We got this phone for our very independent 10 year old. I thought maybe we would have service issues or the phone would feel cheap but that could be over looked because of our need and the price, but i was wrong! The phone is sturdy and calls and texts go through great! Its reliable. Now three of his school friends are getting this as their started phone. There is no selfie camera, which could be a good thing. Luckily my son doesn't want that phone works for him."
B00PWEN2ZE,M. Degelleke,4,"I've had the phone for a few weeks and so far I like it. no problem getting in, sounds good, can hear pretty well, though I use the speaker for the most part. I've had 3 phones in the past 6 months from tracfone, hopefully this one does better than those did."
B00PWEN2ZE,TildaCupD,5,"Bought for my elderly mom. She likes it. Low to midrange phones are getting better and better. My next phone will be a mid-range. I'm done buying $600 phones every two years. It's a sucker's game.

There is no flash on this phone, and the photos are a bit soft. I wouldn't print them out and stick them in a frame. But I'd sure as heck email, share, upload them. Other than that it's a great little smartphone."
B00PWEN2ZE,C2CO,4,"I really, really like the Moto E but it's not perfect. It replaced my LG 840. It's simply an excellent, solid Android phone with a really good touch screen... with lot's of great apps available for download. I was a bit disappointed that I could not transfer text minutes and data between each other like I could with the non-Android LG 840. So texts and data are silo'd so I can't take minutes from data and use them for texts and vice versa. And TRACFONE charges 1 min per text on the Moto E instead of .30 minutes for non-Android phones like the LG 840 for some reason or other. It is good that TRACFONE triples the minutes on both texts and data when I add a card. But it would be nice to be interchangeable between data and texts and it would be nice to use .30 min per text instead of 1 min per text. And data can go down pretty fast if not careful. Especially when using a popular app like Waze. As much as possible I try to use wifi and keep off the data hungry cell towers. The screen could be brighter in sunlight but its good enough. The only other problem is it's hard to get apps off internal memory to an SD card. Most apps want to stay on internal memory and don't offer easy options to slide over to an SD card. So I don't use as many apps as I would otherwise. There are solutions to this that can be googled up but it gets pretty technical and a bit time consuming. So you win some and lose some. All in all the benefits of the Moto E significantly outweigh the negatives for me."
B00PWEN2ZE,PhotoFogey,4,"OK value for the price paid (under 20 bucks for two year old technology) but lacking in features, mediocre camera, not enough memory to add more than a couple apps beyond what Google forces on us. It's better than what I used previously, but I'll probably look to upgrade soon. One good point, battery is good, charge lasts 2-3 times longer than my previous phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,razzy,5,"Great tracfone. I had a Samsung Galaxy and was tempted many times to deep six it. This phone is leaps and bounds better than Galaxy. It's quick and no pauses when in use.Again , very happy with the Moto E."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"It arrived on time, and it was easy to switch over from my previous older flip phone. One thing for users who have a lot of minutes on their older phone, the maximum amount they will give you is 512 of each calls, texts, and data.And you can turn off the data when you don't want to use it. So I had like 1200 minutes and that was kind of a downer, but that's the only downside to it really.

Onto the phone: For utilizing a tracfone plan for a smartphone it works well. Easy to check how many calls/texts/data you have left. The phone is sleek and generally fast for being a cheaper smartphone. It works well, and has a good camera! It's not the BEST smartphone on the market, but for someone still on a tracfone plan, it's very worth it.

All in all, I would highly recommend it. Just don't expect to get all of your minutes transferred to the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,sara sara,5,"Takes beautiful pictures. Takes better pictures than the camera I used to have. Was a big help when we went on vacation and my old camera broke. I still didn't figure out a lot of the things it can do, but that is OK. I can use it for an emergency phone to call help and use it as a camera. The price is great."
B00PWEN2ZE,J. Whitfield,4,"Overall, I'm very happy with the performance of my Moto E. The internet speed, wifi reception, memory, and battery life are all good. It only has one flaw that I can tell; the camera doesn't have the ability to focus on objects within about 6"" or less (like bar codes). That makes a lot of shopping apps that scan bar codes like Cartwheel not usable for that function."
B00PWEN2ZE,Lance,5,"Great phone! This phone was bought as a spare and work phone. Its simple and easy to use. It also runs the latest versions of pretty much any app like YouTube or Amazon. You get what you pay for, and for 20 bucks you can't go wrong! I recommend this phone for a child's first phone. It has durible gorilla glass and its only 20 dollars so if it gets broken its definitely not the end of the world."
B00PWEN2ZE,j. vermont,2,"Don't do it! I'm on my second one. There just isn't adequate storage (first one just died out of the blue). It's easy enough to navigate, but runs out of room in no time and that is only with a couple of apps. I was not able to move much of anything to the SD card. My husband has one too and within a month of owning one we were constantly getting notifications that storage space was running out. Other than the storage issue, I guess it's fine, but I suggest looking for something with more storage."
B00PWEN2ZE,Casey Hatton,4,"I'm not a heavy user of apps, but I love the FM radio feature. I find the way this phone handles messages a little awkward. I guess I'm used to the way my old phone operated. The browsing feature seems to work much better than my old phone(LG) This phone takes much better pictures than my old phone, but I still have trouble seeing the screen in broad daylight. For the price this phone is a great deal."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jane Ross,1,"The item had been taped showing it had been opened. The sim card was missing . Very disappointing. Returned. Battery had been left in so even after charging it it would not stay on while trying to get instructions from provider. As noted these phones do not come with ample information from the companies but seem to assume everyone knows the"" missing parts ""since phones are so prevalent today. It might have been a nice phone ."
B00PWEN2ZE,m,4,"This phone is listed at 59.99 now but when I bought it in March it was only $18.50. No idea why the big price difference. I didn't get a discount for signing up for an Amazon card. I like it fine for that price but wouldn't pay 60 bucks. It doesn't have a front facing camera and comes with so much preloaded that you can't delete, that there is barely room to install the apps you want. But it does work well. I get pretty good signal where I live and it connects to wifi ok."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Wonderful smart phone at a great price! My husband was looking for a Tracfone that was dependable and easy to use and we found it at a great price in this Motorola Moto E...plus we got a special triple minute bonus...Thanks so much for this deal...we could not have afforded to purchase otherwise!
B00PWEN2ZE,S. T. Jensen,5,Works great! Especially for the price!! This phone triples you call and message mileage automatically and we've had no trouble with it since activating it with Tracphone! A great alternative to standard phone plans and makes kid think about it before blowing data and minutes!
B00PWEN2ZE,zee-Scotten zee-destroyer of duplicitous white collar criminals,5,"I've owned four of these. I ruined two on a kayak trip by putting them in a bag with a bottle of water that came open. Probably could have saved them if I could have gotten the batteries out. I have over 2,000 Amazon Prime songs on one of the phones. I've kayaked from Montana to Key West the past couple years and the phones have worked well."
B00PWEN2ZE,JSK,2,Although I only paid $19.99 17 months ago I thought the battery would last longer. it will now charge but is depleted in about 12 hours. doubt that I could replace battery. I guess for the price you just don't get a phone with a decent battery.
B00PWEN2ZE,Stephano,5,"I have never owned a smartphone until today. It absolutely boggles my mind that they're selling this phone for 50 bucks right now. This is a mini computer for *fifty dollars.* I haven't started tracfone service with it but can still do plenty of things by being connected to my home wifi. It's incredible. If you want an entry level smartphone for cheap, here you go."
B00PWEN2ZE,Joseph Alinoski,4,"Phone all in all very nice. It's smaller than the usual smart phone and so easier to hold in your hand to make a call but the text is also smaller. The only real negative is that, since I got the phone from Amazon (not HSN or QVC) my minutes did not rollover and my end date of service did not advanced a year (or at all)"
B00PWEN2ZE,rick conti,5,"I`ve had the Moto E for 3 week`s now,and i love it.First Motorola phone i have had.Have only had LG phones.I think the MotoE is a much better choice than the LG Optimus Fuel.Moto E is about 30.00 more than than the LG fuel,but is very much worth the price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Angie,5,"I'm pleasantly surprised with this phone. This is my first smart phone, and I think it is a great transition phone for those of us behind the times. Still getting the knack of it, like searching contacts and texting, but those will come with time."
B00PWEN2ZE,Harold K,5,"This phone has an excellent picture. I have other LG306G phones for calls, but I could use this for calls if I want. I use this mostly for web use, to search, Facebook, and chat sites, as well as watch Xfinity 2 Go, using earphones. I can use it for free outgoing calls through an app. The size is convenient for listening to TV shows with it in my pocket to view the show when interested. The 4.4.4 Android is snappy."
B00PWEN2ZE,Shannon A,5,Good product at a reasonable price.
B00PWEN2ZE,Bryan,5,"I got this phone to use as a development test phone, as my everyday phone is a moto G, 2nd gen, I feel in love with this Moto E, build with then same design and usage as all Moto phones. I carry it around now all the time, I have never had an issue with it, feel amazingly great in your hand, battery life is good, screen is nice..."
B00PWEN2ZE,Judy K Shirek,5,This phone is excellent. The android loads free apps fast with plenty of space for storage. The only negative is the camera is not reversible so no selfies. The price was good and performance is excellent. The camera is clear and clean photos and video excellent..
B00PWEN2ZE,"Dan F., WI",5,"Upgraded from an LG L840 which, altho' supposedly a ""Smart Phone"", was not. This is everything I expect from a Smart Phone. Easy web access, fast downloads, and full access to apps. The screen provides crisp & clear pictures. Love this phone so much that I bought one for my son. Highly recommended!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Home decorator,5,First 'smartphone' for a skeptical baby-boomer...easy to learn to use with lots of apps / potential. Like the triple TracFone minutes - a real plus.
B00PWEN2ZE,van mettler,1,"Having had this phone for about 6 months now I don't have a lot of good to say about it.
I continue to have problems when answering a call, the slide is pretty hokey way to open up a call. The phone also hangs up on me at times, combined with the high use of the battery this is a phone I will soon throw away"
B00PWEN2ZE,TD : ),4,"I bought this for my senior mom and she loves it but it was kind of hard to program to get it working. I'm pretty tech savvy but found it difficult to set up. Once set up, it's a perfect cell for new user. I suggest buying a bright E moto case to protect it from being dropped and makes it easy to find if misplaced."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bernadette Russell,4,I've been using Tracfone since 2008. There is no better service or deal out there for a senior low phone use person.This Moto E is far superior to the first two androids that I purchased; Samsung Galaxy wasn't too bad but the LG was very quirky awful.
B00PWEN2ZE,maria schwarz,5,I got this for my mom for her birthday. She wanted to try a smart phone and this has proven to be an easy one to start with. The android system is like her tablet so she's picking it up quickly. The pictures are great and the sound way better than her old phone. She couldn't be happier Since she is 2 states away- no pictures
B00PWEN2ZE,sabotage08,4,"By far, the BEST of all the offerings from TracFone I've ever used. It's pretty fast when I want to check the web. The apps and widgets work great. Google Play store downloads are quick. Wifi works great. The screen is larger than the ZTE Valet (my previous phone) and responsive -silky smooth when sliding through pages or opening apps. The sound quality if excellent. I gave it a four star because the 5mp camera is just ok (no flash) and well it's a TracFone not an i-phone. But still, it's pretty darn good."
B00PWEN2ZE,silo guy,1,"This is a GOOGLE PHONE. That means that it will transfer
several Gigabytes of data to and from this phone whenever
Google feels like it. It transferred 18 Gigabytes in the
first 4 days after activating it. Completely blowing
out my restricted bandwidth. So far it has cost me $80 of overage
charges and I still have a week to go in the cycle. Why does
it have to update ALL of the dozens of apps every week? (answer:
advertising revenue). Why does Youtube play every video that
goes viral without even telling you about it? (answer:
advertising revenue). I have no idea what most of the
data ransfers were for but most of it was fom Google Play Store.
If you end up with one of these monsters, do the following:
1) disable WiFi during your prime time. 2) disab;e updates
3) disable background data tranfsers 4) disable foreground
data transfers. I'm still spending manhy hours looking for
more Google Mines."
B00PWEN2ZE,MariaRose,5,"What do you want for $50? Well these are well worth more but for us that's plenty of dough to spend, we have 3-$150 total. (Our previous 3 phones cost $15-total, $5 each, not bad for slider text, talk, and more.) Add SD card $10 ea, case $10; $70. Low price Won't last forever, good as an on hand emergency backup too."
B00PWEN2ZE,Steve,5,"Fantastic phone. It has a bigger screen (4.5 in), and lots of room for apps. It's by far and away the best Tracfone I've ever had. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a smartphone, and doesn't want to pay the high overhead of having a contract plan. This phone is a keeper!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer Corbin,5,Product was as described. Meets my need. Is Trac-fone ready.
B00PWEN2ZE,george fields,5,I have been through 6 phones...THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I EVER HAD !!!!! I Love It ! I am still exploring the many many features..I received this phone 2 days early ...I cant say enough good things about it....However......(I wish it had a front camera)...it only has a back camera...lol
B00PWEN2ZE,Enna,5,A very good phone for the money. Have used tracfone. This has worked well for me. Took getting use to the Android. I am an Apple user but the Moto e was my first smartphone. It was as expected works fine and is perfect for me. Like the size and fits my hand. Over all a very good deal and glad I bought the Moto e.
B00PWEN2ZE,Michelle C. Robinson,4,"Boy was happy to have to use wifi and download games and have 911 available.his older brother didn't try to take this phone from him because it wasn't ""cool"". Price was under $20 for me but was worth more in his estimate."
B00PWEN2ZE,AprilRayne,5,"I love my new phone, I like the sound. The Apps! I am starting to feel smart! It talks when you are searching for something with Google :) I read reviews of other Tracfone and being on a tight budget this is a perfect way to go!"
B00PWEN2ZE,game fan,5,"Excellent purchase. I had found this phone on the Tracfone site available for use in my zip code area. The quality of this phone was far better than any of my past phones. It was quick and easy to upgrade my tracfone by purchasing from this seller. The phone was delivered quickly and was as advertised ""new"". I like everything about this android phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,JohnDoe,5,"The phone works perfectly, and has everything that I expected. The camera isn't extremely good, but it isn't low quality either. Many complain about the storage of this phone, but 2 GB of free space is enough, at least for me. For only 40 dollars, this is probably the best phone you are going to get."
B00PWEN2ZE,Eddy Zee,4,"This is an awesome phone for the price. It's definately one of the best available for Trakfone accounts. Most of what you want in a smart phone is available and it has a zippy snapdragon processor. My previous smart phone was a ZTE which was so slow you were out of luck if you wanted to do anything besides take a picture or make a call.
The Moto E does have some obvious drawbacks mostly having to do with it only having 2 gigs of ram which limits how many apps you can have. You can add up to 32 gigs with an sd card, but most apps have to load from the phone itself and cannot be migrated. The Moto E also has a very limitted fixed-focus camera with about the quality of an old Kodak disposable camera. You have to tap the screen to take a picture, and this motion makes taking a clear shot next to impossible. Other than those two drawbacks, it is wonderful.
The phone was only 78 bucks and the service costs me about 7 bucks a month, a bargain at three times the price! Just don't leave your Nikon at home."
B00PWEN2ZE,super shopper,5,"My husband loves his Moto E. With the bigger screen than the Samsung Galaxy, he no longer needs a stylus to text. We love Tracfone and will never go back to a contract phone. Tracfone phones keep getting better and more modern. Best thing...no monthly bills. The one thing Tracfone needs is to have Text Minutes that can be purchased separately like the Data Minutes ."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bonnie,5,"Works very well. Still going strong after 2-3 years. Thanks, Motorola!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Richard Large,3,"Has trouble with Bluetooth ,Amazon cloud as far as downloaded mp3s,and if they play on Google play only 1 track it seems locked in unless you hit a Wi-Fi hot spot ,then it changes,I am currently having a rough time with Bluetooth headphones
Thanks"
B00PWEN2ZE,RascalCate,4,"For the price, it is a good phone. I am one of the very few people who do not own a cell phone, nor do I have any desire for one. But this TracFone is a great option for someone like me. Bonus is that with purchase you have your call time tripled."
B00PWEN2ZE,wesley78,3,Very disappointed I linked it with my family safe phone bought a case for it the case didn't fit and the speaker for listening to a call quit working so I'm not happy.
B00PWEN2ZE,DF,4,My first iPhone. It operates as described. It is not difficult to activate. I like it more and more as I learn to use this model. I didn't want to spend a bundle on an item I will not use heavily. I recommend this to others. This is a CDMA phone that uses Verizon's towers.
B00PWEN2ZE,M. Young,4,"Great Tracfone choice with two exceptions: No selfies option and no scrolling of your account balance; if you want to check your balance you have to go through the app to do so, which wouldn't be so back except those of us that don't have wifi readily available, have to use our data to check the balance. Otherwise great phone!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Chris,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a Tracfone. Does everything I need it to and then some. It also receives a signal where my old Tracfone wouldn't. You can't beat the price and does everything my daughters Galaxy does. Only one camera, but I'm not a selfie fan, but it comes with FM radio and GPS, which trumps two cameras in my book. The camera it has is pretty good too. Non focusing but takes good photos. Bottom line I could use it for 6 months, replace it and still would've gotten my moneys worth."
B00PWEN2ZE,llacosse,5,"Geeze! For 20 bucks a nice buy. This is the first so called ""smart phone"" I've owned. Why oh why do people spend hundreds on smartphones from Samsung and Apple? I have an Amazon HDX Fire to do all that internet stuff when needed. And yes! I'm an older generation guy."
B00PWEN2ZE,Rcumm,5,"I love my new Motorola Moto E Android Smartphone with triple minutes.This phone works great and it has all the features op a expensive Apple smartphone without the high price.Best of all I only paid $35. after applying my $45.Amazon gift card.It arrived right on time and the details in the description was correct.I now have triple minutes,text and data all which was transferred from my old phone for free.Thank you Amazon,Shopcelldeals and Tracfone for such a great deal."
B00PWEN2ZE,Marcelo,4,"Came quite fast, packaging was nice retail, phone quality is impressive for the price. Feels a little heavy, which is good. Battery last pretty long. It is very responsive. It is a pleasure to use. I like the corning gorilla glass a lot. The only downside is that it is small, I press the wrong keys constantly."
B00PWEN2ZE,W. Stanley,4,This is a really useful bargain smart phone for use on networks like TracFone. The settings allow me to manage when the phone uses data so I don't run out and the call quality is much improved over my old LG. You're not buying a top of the line Android device or an Apple but you are getting a smartphone that lets you manage your minutes and data without big monthly bills.
B00PWEN2ZE,Codeman,3,"Phone seems nice. However, it was advertised as triple the minutes yet, when I activated the phone this was not the case and there was no option for triple the minutes."
B00PWEN2ZE,Gdawg82,1,"Never worked. Kept saying meid number didn't exist. Couldn't return it so we wasted money on this phone. We just wanted a replacement so we still had this for our kids when they biked around our neighborhood. Disappointed, yet still just want a replacement"
B00PWEN2ZE,Paris Mickens,1,Does this phone not have a speaker???? 'I'm so confused as to why I can only hear with the feadphone in which will not stay in my 3 year old reads. Smh. waste of money. We've literally tried everything to resolve this issue and yet to be able to. So disappointment. This was supposed to be his his christmas gift.
B00PWEN2ZE,R. VERNIER,5,"I have owned this phone for a month. It has been great so far. An easy transition from my old tracfone. It took less than 10 minutes to set it up on line. It took great photos when I took it on vacation at Disney World, it is too bad it doesn't have a flash, however, even in some of the lower light rides and shows it did a nice job."
B00PWEN2ZE,Karma Police,5,"Major upgrade to this beauty! Had old flip phone still, been tracfone user for over 12 years. It's perfect for my needs. Now with this new phone my text and phone minutes are counted separately whereas before they were counted together. So I get so much more. Glad I made the upgrade to it."
B00PWEN2ZE,R. Bollinger,5,got this as a present for a friend works well and tracfone service works well out in the county
B00PWEN2ZE,Gretchen S.,4,I love the fastness of the way that it loads but there is on problem there is not enough Internal memory on the phone and that cases a problem for me can't get all the app's that I won't on it. But for the most part I love the phone and it a lot better then the other phones that I had from Tracfone they keep freezing up all the time.
B00PWEN2ZE,UNCLEBUNNY,5,"GREAT PHONE, LOVE IT. DOES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT I NEED, ONLY DRAW BACK NO FLASH ON CAMERA OR LED FOR FLASHLIGHT. DOES TAKE A GOOD PICTURE REGARDLESS. IF YOU BUY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT, SEEMS TO HAVE ALL THE RIGHT BELLS & TOYS. I'M HARD OF HEARING AND HAVE NO PROBLUM HEARING ON THIS PHONE. IT'S 5 STARS FOR ME, EASY SET UP AND CAN'T BEAT THE TRIPLE MIN'S..."
B00PWEN2ZE,NO NAME,3,"I really didn't get to use the phone because horrible Tracfone can't give you any information correctly and this is a CDMA phone and not a GSM phone which they say (after you buy it) is what you need for it to work! I have spent more time on the phone with them for half right information that has caused me more problems and days and days of time and trouble! I used to like them but as so many say, they have gone DOWN HILL and have horrible customer service. They don't care if it costs you a bunch of money or minutes to correct a problem, they tell you AFTER THE FACT that things won't work. I just spent 50 minutes to find all this out which is almost half of the minutes on my card plan! So this might be a great phone, I liked the reviews, but Tracfone, is another sorry story. They don't care. I hate having to return it, Amazon got it out fast and sweet, and case and all the supplies, but thanks to Tracfone's lack of good help and info, I have to return it all, which hurts both of us."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bob Koure,4,"Got this as a spare for my wife.
This uses the Verizon network. It even had data connectivity the last time we were in Northern Maine (U.S. Cellular), so voice/text/data work on that network as well."
B00PWEN2ZE,03bandit,5,"bought this to replace an older lg I had that went crazy,,this is a much better phone and it runs so much smoother. Would buy again..great price and fast shipping..."
B00PWEN2ZE,David Burkhart,5,"This is a great phone - very good performance, good feel, no problems. I did notice slightly less volume from the speaker than other phones. But, it is loud enough for me and probably for most people as well."
B00PWEN2ZE,MBlanke,5,"Nice Phone, but the camera does not have a flash, and the Kit Kat 4.4 won't save to the mini SD drive. But it's supposed to have update capabilities. so that's not the companies fault. It's got 2 gb of room on the phone, so it's working, but I wish it had more like 32 gb."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michelle,5,"Bought this as a first phone for my son. I know he was a little envious of his sisters iphone, and purposely tried to break it. Two years later, and a few rainstorms, many drops, it still works fine. Camera sucks, but oh well."
B00PWEN2ZE,E. Wilson,5,Best phone I ever had will buy this brand of phone for now on. can easily move through the phone but would like more detailed brouchure that comes with the phone
B00PWEN2ZE,Marty,5,Great value phone from a quality brand. Nice interface. No issues with TracFone service. IF you are into using a lot of apps you might want to find another phone as internal memory is small. Still very recommended for voice / text / basic photo and basic web surfing!
B00PWEN2ZE,James,4,"Not bad of a phone for 20$
It has all the features of a regular phone and works just fine
It does have a small internal storage but with an SD card, you could solve that problem
It does not have a front camera which is devastating but I could live without it
If you want a cheap phone, get this right now"
B00PWEN2ZE,MichaleCS,5,Our phone provider forced us to upgrade to Android so this was a good reasonable device.
B00PWEN2ZE,Rajvir Daniel Singh,5,"There are definitely better phones out there and some are even cheaper, but unlike the others this was the best cheap phone that could be shipped to Canada.

My younger brother is very impressed with the product."
B00PWEN2ZE,alexandra toribio,3,it state that it has simcard. but it doesn't. please fix discription.
B00PWEN2ZE,J. McGee,5,"They worked well in our rural area, easy to use. 1st generation of the model in case you didn't know. WiFi picks up well, has a radio feature. Easy setup and easy to transfer contacts via Bluetooth from old phone. Battery life is good so far."
B00PWEN2ZE,sliceblocker,4,Am still learning how to use the phone as it is my first smart phone but it seems to be very well made and I have spoken to others who have the phone who say that it is durable and reliable. The tutorials on the Trac Phone web site are helpful in learning about the product
B00PWEN2ZE,D. Slagle,3,"Is a good phone, just has very little space so you can't have much on it"
B00PWEN2ZE,Sharon E. Wilkes,5,This is a great phone for the price. The size is nice and the sound is great. I prefer no contract phones -the only feature I would like is if it had a front facing camera on it otherwise it's perfect for me.
B00PWEN2ZE,Gena Lundquist,5,"The best tracfone to date, it is just as good as my coworkers iPhones and androids and I pay in 1 year what they pay in a month for their family!! Well worth it, it's fast and user friendly!"
B00PWEN2ZE,cyclist101,3,"It's okay, but doesn't have enough onboard memory. You can get a disc to put in it, which helps some, but most apps won't go to the memory disc and you will have trouble having even a few apps on it because they will soak up all the memory you have. It's fine as a phone, but not for storing lots of apps."
B00PWEN2ZE,Raine,5,"love the phone, when I buy minutes through tracfone I automatically get triple minutes, data, and texts. Glad I got it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Mardella Brobst,5,First smart phone--very happy with it. Easy to figure out--love the predictive text feature as I mainly use my phone for texting. Like the variety of apps & has good sound quality. Excellent value for the price. Transaction completed quickly.
B00PWEN2ZE,pmc,5,"good phone for the price works better than I expected. bought it for my young niece, many features fairly fast internet connections smart and handy"
B00PWEN2ZE,Shane,5,"Such a great phone. It's cheap, and it works just as well as any iPhone. The best part about it is using it with tracphones byop program! One of my best Amazon purchases! (one tip though, buy a case, it's somewhat hard to hold it without one)"
B00PWEN2ZE,JimIn Raleigh,5,"Really nice phone. Bought for my non-techy spouse, now she's a texting machine! Clear images, easy to use and set up."
B00PWEN2ZE,BuyerOfStuff,1,"Absolute piece of crap. My phone is less than 3 months old, and has no audio or sound w/o headphones. You can't play music, use it as an alarm or a GPS, can't watch videos or even use speakerphone. Factory reset and all the other advice you get does no good. Apparently this is a common problem with this model."
B00PWEN2ZE,Sheryl Barton,5,Fast quick phone. Replaced my Samsung Centura. Tracfone had to transfer my phone number and minutes over. The on-line transfer would only transfer my phone number not my minutes or time. Customer support did the transfer very quickly. Works fine on Wi-fi and travels well.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,2,Very little internal storage on this phone. Android and the factory installed apps (which you can not uninstall) uses up more than half the storage. Not all apps that you install can be move to your external SD card. I can only install 4 or 5 apps before the phone starts lagging. Look for a phone with a little more storage.
B00PWEN2ZE,booklover,5,"Was a little nervous based on some of the reviews as regards transferring from an existing Tracfone account. Mine worked seamlessly, took about 20 mins from start to finish. My existing minutes transferred also. I got the equivalent in minutes, text and data. Good deal! Just arrived today (a day early in fact!) so early days for the phone. So far everything is excellent!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Zee in CA,5,"I have had several phones and this one (and Tracfone who I have been with for years) is my favorite. Excellent size (fits in my pocket with no problem), and very user friendly. I am elderly so the ""user friendly"" is very important."
B00PWEN2ZE,Nathan,5,"This is a great value for a phone, and the screen is of a reasonable size, not so small that it is hard to read, and not so large that the phone is too bulky to fit in someone's pants pocket. I would buy this phone again."
B00PWEN2ZE,Marva,5,"Loved the phone but only lasted 6 months. While charging it in my cold car, the phone died. I re-read the manual that said, ""Don't charge in the cold."". Never had that problem with my old phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Donald Winder,1,"What a piece of junk, nothing but trouble,dropped calls, will receive calls but won't make calls, just plain difficult to use. It seems to have a mind of its own and it hates me! I thought it was a learning curve but this phone is a really nice looking piece of junk!!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Retired Adman,5,"What a great phone for the money. I was worried that the ""Triple Minutes"" feature of the phone would remain since I wasn't buying it direct from Tracfone, but there was no problem with that. I got triple minutes with the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Geneva,5,Bought this for my 4 year old to watch Thomas on YouTube. Never activated it since he doesn't need service and uses WiFi. Perfect!
B00PWEN2ZE,Nancy,5,"the Motorola Moto E Android Prepaid phone for Tracfone is incredible. It does everything anyone could want or need. The only problem it would have is no front camera if someone likes to take selfies. I don't, so that is no problem for me. I was very please with this phone.
.."
B00PWEN2ZE,RChickz,5,I purchased this for my daughter. She likes it. It is a good inexpensive phone. We have had it for a few months now and have had no issues with it!
B00PWEN2ZE,D. Jensen,5,"I love this phone still working on all the features. Love speaking into the phone to send an email, beats typing in each letter!! Would recommend this phone to everyone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Edward M.,5,it works good with a long batt. use but best the triple min.
B00PWEN2ZE,Mike C.,1,"Dealing with overseas call centers was my problem. Most of the people tried to be helpful, but they were reading from a script and could not deal with the simple transfer of along standing TracFone account on an old flip phone to a new smart phone. After two days and more then 10 hours on the phone, I gave up. I returned the phone to amazon.
My experience was when finally getting someone after waiting on line for... I would ask for service, pause, would I ""please wait on hold while I checked with my supervisor"" and then silence... after 45 minutes, I would hang up and try again.
At the end of the second day the young man told me since straight talk and tracfone were sister companies and my old phone was now under straight talk and the new phone was a tracfone, I would have to cancel my old phone contract from straight talk and set up a new contract with TracFone. OK! OK!
So I call again to TracFone and said I wanted to activate my new smart phone. They could do that. Good. I said I would like to have auto-pay and here is my credit card number. Oh, he said, we don't do that. You have to buy plan cards and then we can active your phone when you get a card.
At this point, I was exhausted. It shouldn't be a two day job to get a cell phone set-up. A company doing business should take your money anyway they can get it. So, I contacted Amazon to return the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,karen,3,Not bad for an inexpensive smart phone. My biggist complaint is the constant blinking light which you don't really notice during the day but at night in a dark or slightly dark room it is very annoying. I have been trying to disable it with no luck so far.
B00PWEN2ZE,LindySD,5,"I was amazed this phone actually had so many options. I mainly use it with my home wi-fi so I don't have the data usages, but it's nice to know I can hook up to wi-fi away from home if I need to. Also, I can text by speaking instead of typing. Fantastic!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,5,What a bargain both for the phone and the service. I do not use a phone much at all. This allows me to have a phone for under $20.00 a month. The phone itself appears to be well made and a nice size and the voice word recognition works well for texting..
B00PWEN2ZE,George L. Buelow,4,"I've had this for several months and it was simple to convert and replace my existing Tracfone. Everything works well and I enjoy using the voice commands. The difficult part was downloading contacts, which it would not do from Tracfone to Tracfone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kevin O'Donnell,3,"I've owned two of these phones; the first one was purchased in a rush as I had just lost my job and with it my company-sponsored phone plan, and the second was a replacement for the first one. Overall it did what it needed to do, which was let me field calls so I could get another job, and I liked the phone enough to hold on to it for a while afterwards.

The good:
First of all, the price is phenomenal, as is the triple minutes deal you get through TracFone. I know a lot of people who are writing reviews have some very well-defined complaints about TracFone, but I have had no issue with them (especially when dealing with my phone dying) and still use them to this day. I never had an issue with incoming or outbound calls with this phone, nor with texting or mobile data for that matter. Most of what I do with my phone, however, is over WiFi, which this phone handles very well. While the storage is limited (more on that later) I was able to install an NES emulator on it and run some games, giving me plenty of amusement whilst taking up very little storage space.

The bad:
This phone's processor isn't the best, and it has trouble handling multiple apps at once. Any apps running in the background will fall asleep, time out, or just fail - not ideal for when you're trying to answer a text whilst also waiting for an Uber. Even more annoying is the phone's lack of storage; if you are tech-minded like myself and can figure out how to A. disable onboard apps, B. move apps to the SD card, and C. occasionally clear cache and unnecessary storage for certain apps then you can keep it running somewhat smoothly, but you will find yourself fighting with the ""running out of storage"" notification from time to time. Bluetooth was a bit iffy, especially with my wireless headphones; occasionally it would use the onboard speaker when it was connected to my headphones, and I would have to restart the phone to get it to work.

Probably most egregious of all was the fact that both phones died under the same circumstances - they would run out of battery whilst charging, and would never charge again. The white charging light would turn on when plugged in, but when it got enough juice to kick the screen on the battery would die and the cycle would start anew. This is apparently a problem with all Motorola phones from that generation, and given that this is a lower-level phone I'd imagine it happens quite a bit more with them - it happened to me twice, both after only two months.

Thankfully, TracFone issued replacements both times, once giving me an LG Destiny instead, which is a far better phone. If you are frugal like myself, are infinitely patient when it comes to loading apps, can deal with limited storage, and (most of all) just need a phone right away (or would like a backup should you need a phone right away) then this could be a good phone, but don't expect it to be your go-to phone for more than two months."
B00PWEN2ZE,Dante M. DiMicco,4,Its a 3G. I went frugal w/my first smart phone. It works. End of story.
B00PWEN2ZE,C. Rraven,4,It is a good bit better and higher technology than my last Tracfone LG. HOWEVER customer service can't get a bread sandwich right! But it is not this suppler nor LG's fault. This phone is very reactive and quick. I am not a online streamer so don't know if that is fast or not.
B00PWEN2ZE,Will W.,4,"I'd put this phone up against any on the market, today. In my opinion it is superior to my wife's Galaxy. Very long battery life & tough gorilla glass sold me."
B00PWEN2ZE,DBanks,5,"I really like this phone, no complaints yet. Very user friendly!"
B00PWEN2ZE,mike claudino,5,"In the Under $100.00 Androids. This phone is good bet. If your looking for loads of free memory, Better keep looking."
B00PWEN2ZE,A. Mellon,5,"Nice phone. Not too high tech, but sufficient as a smartphone for someone who needs one, but doesn't want to put out a bunch of money. Easy for my in laws to use, so that's what we needed."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pat Casey,5,I've had this for about 2 months and have no complaints. For the price it's great. I use it with tracfone cards and get triple minutes everytime I buy time.
B00PWEN2ZE,Scott March,5,Great phone for low cost.
B00PWEN2ZE,GDB,4,"Good phone for the price. I use it with my WIFI & in travel mode. It's only function is with my YAV1 radar detector app. Therefore, I do not need any phone service."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michael Cook,5,"Works very well. Camera is not great, but adequate. WIFI range could be better, but it seems to hold connections well as long as you have good signal. The screen is easy to read. For the price it is a very good phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Nessan,5,"Excellent device. I got this as a gift for my little brother and man, this thing can take a beating. The screen quality blow me away. I have a nexus 6p and this little thing is sharp. Also the battery is ridiculous. All in all it was completely worth the purchase. A must buy if you want a good quality Android from a good company."
B00PWEN2ZE,Marty O'Boyle,5,"Phone arrived on schedule, well packaged. Haven't yet set up a Tracfone account, but did check the phone out on Wi-Fi. found it to be easy to use and responsive. I'll update my review after I get started with Tracfone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Donald Duquette,5,"Good phone for the price, picks up wi-fi better than most. I would recommend this as a inexpensive alternative to other pay as you go phones."
B00PWEN2ZE,kc,5,"Works good for a ""house phone"". Havnt had any trouble with it so far"
B00PWEN2ZE,Polly,5,Easy to use for anyone that has trouble with cell phones
B00PWEN2ZE,C. Demeter,4,"Purchased this for a friend that never used a Smart Phone before. It took a few weeks for him to get comfortable with it. The short time I played with it, I was fairly impressed for what the price was."
B00PWEN2ZE,Lori,4,"Wonderful 1st phone. Bought 2 at $20 each, then a third 6 months later at $50. That will teach me not to procrastinate!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Curt,4,"Works well, good quality phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,N. Williams,5,"So far, so good ... all of the phones that I've had before this were dinosaurs ... so I am still learning what this one can do. So far, I like it; I rather like Motorola, and was happy to find one that I like available. It is, indeed, a smart phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,MOOCHIE,5,"I am so glad I bought this phone. I have been using Tracfone for many years & decided to stay with them. This phone has triple minutes which is a big plus. I haven't had any problems at all. It works great, sounds good & one thing I really enjoy is FM radio. Cool"
B00PWEN2ZE,Chris Alford,5,"Like the others are saying.. such a big upgrade going to this phone over the ZTE VALET! I highly recommend it! Hopefully in another year we will be able to get a quad core version (moto g, or even moto x?) with 4G data!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Linda L. Taylor,4,"Nice beginners smart phone. Still learning. Was not happy with the switching of my old phone and the new one with Tracfone customer service though, had to call several times and they told me I would have the same phone number, learned the following day that was not true. The phone is fairly easy to use and perfect for me."
B00PWEN2ZE,JT Adams,2,SD card reader failed within a couple months.
B00PWEN2ZE,Dee,1,All the previous complaints about the phone's speaker are true. It has completely failed after one week. Now I understand why the phone is $19.99.
B00PWEN2ZE,Dbl2011,2,"Works very bad ,I do not have a lot of apps on it .Just want I needed how ever on coverage one bar at home can not use phone!!!!!"
B00PWEN2ZE,thomas fleming jr,5,I needed this phone to replace the one my grandson lost. He was excited and very pleased.
B00PWEN2ZE,Laurie G.,5,"Really love the big screen, and the colors are very bright. I also like the camera although its not front/rear you can hit the screen anywhere not just one button.Very easy to set up and sync with other devices, and very fast. Still learning all that it has on it and can do."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jeff Northon,5,"Well made and works well. I got one for me, my kids and my 89 year young Father. I NEVER thought I would be showing him how to use Google!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Peter Fink,3,"The phone has been fine but I may have a problem getting onto WiFi connections. My apartment is 10 feet from my friend's and landlords router wifi and he and any guests he might have over have no problem connecting without submitting a password. He purposely did not ""lock"" it so anyone could use it. Nobody has to use a password but me. I have tried using an old one he had and it starts to connect and then tells me ""AUTHENTICITY PROBLEM"". This is causing me to use up data minutes like crazy. I spoke with Tracphone tech support and after a long period on the phone they said to contact COMCAST the wifi provider. It's not them because everyone connects but me. Any ideas - thanks"
B00PWEN2ZE,redrex88,5,"Its working great, after a few start up problems. Camera is so-so, Youtube videos not as good as was with my LG, but it does other things far much better. A good phone for most applications."
B00PWEN2ZE,Cliffgypsy,5,"For the money, couldn't beat it with a stick. Got it, used it, loved it, showed it to my friend who was so impressed he HAD TO BUY ONE! The only complaint either of us have is poor reception in some places. But we live in a very rural area, and there just aren't enough cell towers near by."
B00PWEN2ZE,w2e3r4,4,"So far I love it. After trying to use an LGL34C for 6 months in complete frustration, this is a beauty. Most operations are intuitive for a 1st time smart phone user. But I guess that's my age showing. Yes I recommend it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Mike Ski,5,Wife loves these phones. A little tough to setup so she can keep her number but still worth the money.
B00PWEN2ZE,Fellow Finn,5,So far so good! Paid an additional $50+ when activating and we have 3 months of service and 360 minutes. It's for my 10 year old for emergencies. Cheaper than contract plans!
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,I have had this phone since May 24th and love it. Love the G P S simply because I have no sense of directions and this one talks to you destination!!! Best bang for my buck. And it fits nicely in my ole hand!!!!
B00PWEN2ZE,Eleazar Meza,5,"If I ever go to the states I can count on having a great little phone to make calls there, in the meantime, as a music player/light mobile gaming machine, this thing is a steal :D"
B00PWEN2ZE,Freda Beaty,5,Beyond my expectation deliver on the date that they said it would nice product for a first smartphone!!!
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,The camera is rather fuzzy. Everything else is great. Would buy another one.
B00PWEN2ZE,John Wagner,5,Amazing features and quality for $20. I simply do no understand why flagship phones cost what they do.
B00PWEN2ZE,Ran Burns,5,I bought this for my mom who has always LOVED Tracfone and I was even impressed with this Moto E. I have and LOVE the Moto G.
B00PWEN2ZE,KRISTI F,5,"I got this phone for my son to replace a LG that had died. The Moto E is fast and a very good, cheap smart phone. It runs faster than my S3."
B00PWEN2ZE,cbenson,4,"This was a really excellent phone for the price until it died just before its 2 year birthday. It took photos, texted, etc. pretty much just like an expensive smart phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,works great love this phone
B00PWEN2ZE,noslp4me,5,"Bought this for my child for emergency purposes. I love the all the features, esp the ability to connect via wifi. Even though it has 3g the connection is just was fast as my 4g phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Prince Vic,5,Working good
B00PWEN2ZE,C. Hinshaw,2,"Battery went bad after nine months. Will not hold charge more than 24 hours. Taught me one thing, do not need a smartphone, even a dumb one"
B00PWEN2ZE,Dawn,5,Smart phone!!! This phone has many features. I can't tell how to know if any missed calls. Does not beep until text is read. Make sure you are connected to public wifi or you will use up your internet time.
B00PWEN2ZE,Corporate Man-Whore,5,Easily the best 20 bucks I have ever spent!
B00PWEN2ZE,B Booth,3,"Good phone, but memory space was an issue."
B00PWEN2ZE,Richard J. Ciesielski,5,"Easy to use, lots ofneat apps , and very good deal for them price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Khaalis Muhammad,3,"It's an okay phone, but for some reason it keeps restarting on me. My storage isn't low and I don't have al ot of apps running in the background."
B00PWEN2ZE,Hal R,5,"I've had this MotoE for about two months and it works and responds almost like the expensive Smartphones. Plus, the 3X bonus on phne time and data time make it a real winner. I highly recommend it."
B00PWEN2ZE,SSCBURG,4,"Item was received as described, good packaging and a quality product."
B00PWEN2ZE,GBS,5,"works fine - had no real problems. Just using it as a basic cell phone, not really into doing internet things"
B00PWEN2ZE,Anna Hicks,5,Works great for price! Can use international with wifi only.
B00PWEN2ZE,Dave,5,Like this phone real well. Dose everything they said it would.
B00PWEN2ZE,SFGirl,1,"Received phone in the mail today. Phone does not charge, stays at zero percent. Plugged into different outlets, it does not work. Called Amazon service help desk. Refund requested."
B00PWEN2ZE,Nstarlight,4,"So far, so good. I'm impressed with this little phone! I did have a little trouble buying Tracfone minutes with the phone, so I had to do it on my computer. But it works great so far."
B00PWEN2ZE,ruth li,5,"I have been using Tracfone services for years and have decided to try a smartphone. Moto E is easy to use than I expected. The speed is fairy fast. It takes good pictures. It has everything I need. For $69.00 with 2 days shipping from Amazon, it's a great bargain. Tracfone tripled the minutes for this transfer including text messages and Data. I'm very pleased with what I have I have gotten a great phone and the good services from Tracfone."
B00PWEN2ZE,ashepp,5,Like the size. Have been using Tracfone for years and this is my favorite phone so far. Can't go wrong with the triple minutes since I usually get double instead.
B00PWEN2ZE,Riley's uncle.,5,"I totally love this phone. I'm using it now and thanks to it's technology it's allowing me a few extra perks.ððð, they can have their fancy I phones I enjoy having my Android smart phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,jose HernÃ¡ndez,4,Bueno lo recomiendo
B00PWEN2ZE,Living Life In The Midwest,5,"Plenty of reviews that discuss the topics I would cover so I will leave all that to others.

I will add that for the money that this item was original selling I purchased a significantly better Unlocked phone to use on Tracfone's BYOP.

If I compare setup of the two the Moto E was set up in minutes by going online to the Tracfone website and transferring the phone number to the new Moto E. That is a plus.
The BYOP required a separate SIM card purchase (I knew this and ordered it at the same time) but required some setting in the phone to be changed manually in order to get Internet access via the mobile network and also required manual settings of the MMS setting to send and receive MMS messages.

So the fact that it is ready to go in minutes is the plus. But here are better BYO phones available is the negative."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bill K,4,"Price to performance is very good. Size and screen clarity are very good at this price point.
Would recommend this phone is you are not a power user."
B00PWEN2ZE,J. Bergeaux,5,Used as a burner phone for a specific need. (not anything nefarious!) Worked fine as a cheap andriod phone with a pre-paid plan.
B00PWEN2ZE,michael mueller,4,"nice phone. hard on me because i am used to a prepaid that does not require me to download apps, set parameters etc. before i would just use the limited features available. i'll get used to it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jeanne Good,5,"The buttons are a little hard to get to connect on the side ie; power buttons, volume etc. But all in all I love it. Has an excellent mic feature"
B00PWEN2ZE,AmazonAddict!,5,"I absolutely LOVE it! I never had a 'Smart' phone before - this is my very first, and my son taught me how to use it properly. I don't get a lot of telephone calls, but I DO get a lot of email, and this phone alerts me so I can check out the email without turning on my computer. It only 'alerts' me by tone one time when something *new* comes in, but if I don't hear that alert there is a tiny red blinking light (which I just discovered) to show me *something* needs attention! I use it a LOT for Grocery Lists at various stores (a program that I downloaded on it), and also for keeping Notes (another program which I downloaded)."
B00PWEN2ZE,Consumer,1,"BUYER BEWARE - TRACFONE refuses to triple minutes for this phone- this add is false advertising. I own 2 of these phones and just noticed the minutes do not triple. Spoke to a TRACFONE manger for 40 minutes - she said this model phone does not qualify for triple minutes - the primary reason I selected this phone. The only way you can get triple minutes on this phone is if you transfer your services to this phone from an active tracfone that does have triple minutes. Call TRACFONE yourself, you will get the same answer. I pay 3X more more for minutes than this phone's add claims because minutes do not triple."
B00PWEN2ZE,Dan,4,Worked for about a year until the phone slowed and the battery weakened. Still not a bad deal!
B00PWEN2ZE,Miguel Chavez,5,"I am so happy with this item, the phone is great and was shipped very fast. Thank you so much!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Kutzeh,3,Not the most user friendly. Good for emergencies.
B00PWEN2ZE,Adrian Cottam,5,"This is the best phone I have ever had. It has really good support and can work completely hands free in the car, which is a huge bonus for me. It is fast and never lags, and I haven't found an app that hasn't worked perfectly on it. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget android phone"
B00PWEN2ZE,Bobby Kewan,5,I've had the Moto E for a few months now and I'm really happy with it! Only down side is having to manually check minutes but that is minor compared to how much I'm liking this phone! I highly recommend.
B00PWEN2ZE,JustAskMe,5,Good starter phone. Bought this for my youngest son for Christmas and he loves it. Does everything a contract phone does without the monthly bills.
B00PWEN2ZE,teach,5,Working just as expected. Holding the charge over three days now. Just right fit to carry in my pocket.
B00PWEN2ZE,Harry Moore,3,"I'd like it a lot better if I could get it to work. Tomorrow afternoon I'm going to take it to WalMart and get them to get it working. They make it sound so simple in the directions, but I'm 88 years old and need some help"
B00PWEN2ZE,Michelle E.,3,"Ok phone but the battery runs down fast and does not have enough internal memory. Also can't focus in closely on anything with the camera, and does not have a front facing camera. It suffices until a better phone can be had. Don't over-price it if selling."
B00PWEN2ZE,a m,5,"Nicer than my Samsung! More features, and much more inexpensive. Should have bought this brand first."
B00PWEN2ZE,B. Slagle,3,"For the price, it's a nice Android phone. The TracFone plans have little to be desired."
B00PWEN2ZE,DS,5,"LOVE it---works great for all I need and no more $ 39 per month phone bill. I only do maybe 20 calls a week and never go past 180
minutes in a month..this is a great way to go----"
B00PWEN2ZE,Capnblinski,5,"Superb. Less drag on system resources due to Motorola's operating system philosophy. Just the right size, along with the moto 2"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,3,"Went to upgrade my old phone, hoping to get better service in certain areas, and this phone is failing on that note - being worse!!! (#YOU LIVE & YOU LEARN)..."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michael Cook,5,"Works very well. Camera is not great, but adequate. WIFI range could be better, but it seems to hold connections well as long as you have good signal. The screen is easy to read. For the price it is a very good phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Nessan,5,"Excellent device. I got this as a gift for my little brother and man, this thing can take a beating. The screen quality blow me away. I have a nexus 6p and this little thing is sharp. Also the battery is ridiculous. All in all it was completely worth the purchase. A must buy if you want a good quality Android from a good company."
B00PWEN2ZE,Marty O'Boyle,5,"Phone arrived on schedule, well packaged. Haven't yet set up a Tracfone account, but did check the phone out on Wi-Fi. found it to be easy to use and responsive. I'll update my review after I get started with Tracfone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Donald Duquette,5,"Good phone for the price, picks up wi-fi better than most. I would recommend this as a inexpensive alternative to other pay as you go phones."
B00PWEN2ZE,kc,5,"Works good for a ""house phone"". Havnt had any trouble with it so far"
B00PWEN2ZE,Polly,5,Easy to use for anyone that has trouble with cell phones
B00PWEN2ZE,C. Demeter,4,"Purchased this for a friend that never used a Smart Phone before. It took a few weeks for him to get comfortable with it. The short time I played with it, I was fairly impressed for what the price was."
B00PWEN2ZE,Lori,4,"Wonderful 1st phone. Bought 2 at $20 each, then a third 6 months later at $50. That will teach me not to procrastinate!"
B00PWEN2ZE,steve carnahan,5,good phone no problems with seller
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,1,"Ear Speaker failed after about 2 months. After excruciating customer service from Tracfone and waiting well over a month and paying for a month for minutes on my old phone and after jumping through many hoops and speaking to supervisors I received a new replacement. Guess what, the ear speaker failed on that one too after less than two months. What a let down. I wouldn't buy this phone at any price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Boyne Guy,4,"My first smart phone, so I struggled a bit at first, but now I am comfortable with it and happy with it's performance."
B00PWEN2ZE,Davem,4,"great phone for the price. it was on sale and I got it for @ $20. It basically does everything the expensive phones do but it has limited memory, one camera and manual connection to wifi points."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,Great phone for my tween! We have had it for 3 months and it's been great. No issues!!! Love that it triples and rolls over minutes.
B00PWEN2ZE,roxiecat,5,"I really like my new phone - it has all the features I want without a huge monthly expense. In fact, this is the second one I ordered, the first was for me and this one was for my husband."
B00PWEN2ZE,Sherrill Hart,5,"For only $50, this Motorola Moto E Android Prepaid Tracfone is a very good buy. Works very well. Well worth the money."
B00PWEN2ZE,angelica,5,i love but he battery dident work enymore sucks
B00PWEN2ZE,Michigan Craftsman,5,"Love this phone! Not as huge as most are now. Works well, was easy to setup an account. Very clear screen and Triple minutes, text and data. ð"
B00PWEN2ZE,Sam,4,"I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks. My initial impression is that it's a solid phone. I haven't been talking or texting much with it, but I have been using apps like Twitter, weather and sports apps. I have my email and calendar on it and it syncs without any problems.

Transferring my number from my old tracfone was easy and happened almost instantaneously.

The camera isn't great and there isn't a front camera if that's important to you. (I'm not deducting for lacking a front camera, it's not important to me.)

The phone will use 3g data unless you change the settings, so be aware of that going in. My first day playing with it I used 20mb of data on 3g downloading an app from Google play. That was intentional to know what kind of data usage I could expect.

The phone will track how much 3g data you're using and how much data you're using on WiFi.

I stuck a 32gb micro sd card in it and set the camera to record to the card instead of the phone.

I deducted one star for the following reasons:

The restrict background data setting (which limits data unless you're on WiFi) turns off easily. It leaves an alert icon at the top of the screen. When swiping down from the top of the screen the listing only needs to be touched to turn off the setting. I'd prefer to have it on all the time and only turn it off by drilling into the settings menu.

I've also been using my phone as an alarm clock. It seems to work well except I couldn't snooze the alarm when there were notifications that popped up overnight. I had to go into the clock to disable the alarm."
B00PWEN2ZE,george sarkees,5,Has more features than I expected. Good value for the money. I bought another one for my wife. We carry them wherever we go.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,A+ Super!Super!
B00PWEN2ZE,user168,4,Excellent phone. Only 4 GB; so keep in mind when selecting this highly affordable tracfone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Valerie,3,"Hmmmm... the Amazon description seemed to imply that it came with the triple minutes. A bit of false advertisement I think.

But phone works fine."
B00PWEN2ZE,K. Fox,4,"Our daughter likes her phone well enough. Some features took a bit of getting used to, after having had an LG model. But she has been happy with it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jack A. Hanks,5,"This is a great phone and performs well above what was expected,highly recommend it."
B00PWEN2ZE,M. O.,5,Nice phone for the price. No problems or complaints. Would recommend if your looking for a phone in this price range.
B00PWEN2ZE,Nancy,4,nice phone... ported over my tracfone # and activated seamlessly. Battery life could be improved so keep your charger handy
B00PWEN2ZE,crazygirl,5,Phone is very user friendly and easy to navigate. I like it. It's the best Android by tracfone that I have purchased so far. Love the gorilla glass. That was the selling point.
B00PWEN2ZE,Fran,5,Perfect size for my husband. Had to get away from flip top phone. Love it
B00PWEN2ZE,roybil,5,Great value. Needs more internal memory. Lots of apps that cannot be moved to memory card.
B00PWEN2ZE,BlsmLkr,5,"This is a nice phone for my husband who isn't big on cell phones. The MP3 feature and some of the apps are great for his use. Just wish the phone had more memory. Will see if we can buy a SD card for storing MP3 files. I would recommend the next generation of this phone, but I think Motorola has some nice phones out there that in my mind competes nicely with the other androids."
B00PWEN2ZE,W.S.,5,"Cute little phone. Good clear screen and it's pretty fast. Although not powerful enough for my main phone, it makes a really good backup."
B00PWEN2ZE,michael bourland,5,"i use a phone to make phone calls, this one sounds good"
B00PWEN2ZE,John Kunnari,3,"The phone was good, until it lost audio after about 4 mos. of normal use. Tracfone stood behind the product and replaced it without cost to me though."
B00PWEN2ZE,Steve,4,"Bought as a cheap second phone to my iPhone. Certainly is not an iPhone, but overall not bad. Serves my purpose well as a back-up phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Best phone I have ever bought new for this price. Still working strong after several months. Pretty good on speed as well with KitKat 4.4
B00PWEN2ZE,Jess,5,Great for my 10 year old he loves it
B00PWEN2ZE,SallyLue,4,I just use it for traveling. It seems to work fine. I just need to set up more of the apps. It has a large enough screen and the touch is good.
B00PWEN2ZE,Anthony,4,"Nice upgrade for Tracfone. For the $ it is super. Data is fast, good storage. I can't imagine a better phone for the $. The best Tracfone I have had thus far. The only thing I'd like more of is battery life, it seems to be average to low average."
B00PWEN2ZE,Bruce Scherer,5,This is the bewst deal for those using 100 minutes or less per month.
B00PWEN2ZE,Mario,5,Works Great! 100% better than my ZTE 665C. Brings up e-mail quickly. Picks up Wi-fi better. Has no flash for camera. It take good photos in low light anyway.
B00PWEN2ZE,Linda,5,"I have gone though a lot of Tracfone androids (and the old flips) and this is a keeper. If you have an old tracfone flip and want to upgrade, this is the best option. Cant beat the price now and easy to use and transfer your old number."
B00PWEN2ZE,Leroy M Sheets Jr,5,This is so much better an improvement over my old phone by leaps and bounds
B00PWEN2ZE,Gary Sarah Lipsius,4,Great little phone for the price.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Great phone.Easy to use.TRIPLE MINUTES!!!!
B00PWEN2ZE,Nana V,5,"Great phone for the price. Does everything I need it for and probably much more. I imagine storage could be a problem for some people, but for my needs it's close to perfect."
B00PWEN2ZE,JLem,5,Phone an upgrade over previous LG Tracfone. Works great so far.
B00PWEN2ZE,brian west,5,"What sharp clear picture, great, great phone for streaming video, just amazed at the quality of picture watching Hulu,use the phone instead of my lap top,"
B00PWEN2ZE,just me,5,Works great
B00PWEN2ZE,V. Lincoln,4,"I like it a lot, and it does what I need it to do. It doesn't hole many added apps, though."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pamela Olson,5,Love this phone I really enjoy using it and I never thought I would say that about any phone I am not a real phone person but this phone is very user friendly. I have been a Tracfone user for years and this phone fits the bill for a user that wants to be connected but not spend hundreds of dollars on a phone and a plan the phone will do what ever you need it to do.
B00PWEN2ZE,P. Duhaime,5,a great phone.... faster than one would expect for the price. Comparable to more expensive phones
B00PWEN2ZE,Bob Schutz,3,Phone is good but dealing with Tracfone will raise your blood pressure. Bottom of the barrel phone support with foreign operators reading instructions from a manual with no clue on what they are saying.
B00PWEN2ZE,Vicki S.,4,"I finally upgraded from a flip phone to a smartphone. This one does the job perfectly for me. The only thing I don't like is that the app's seriously drain the battery, even with closing them when i'm done. I recharge nightly, but the phone rarely holds a charge longer then 10 hrs. If battery life was longer it would have been 5 stars."
B00PWEN2ZE,Francine Clark,1,"Leaves much to be desired, if it works"
B00PWEN2ZE,Satisfied Customer,4,"Very inexpensive, had to get used to the OS. Seems to be built well with good battery life."
B00PWEN2ZE,D. Rude,4,"Great phone, just wish it had more memory and that you could move more apps over to the memory card."
B00PWEN2ZE,Luv2trvltheworld,4,"Surprisingly smooth screen and decent features. Nothing super fast, but a decent phone for your elderly relatives."
B00PWEN2ZE,JOSE,5,"Great phone for the money ! Much better than expected. I had a ZTE, this is a higher level of performance, good for Motorola !
Vendor shipped immediately and got it before scheduled date."
B00PWEN2ZE,a/pc,5,Nice to be able to get a fully functional Android-phone on the cheap.
B00PWEN2ZE,Sky V P,5,Best of the TracFone 4.4 smartphones. Our household has all of the 4.4 android smartphones from TracFone and this is the best quality. If you want to take selfies you will need the Ultimate 2 or the Alcatel Icon Pop
B00PWEN2ZE,Rex,5,got it so my 3yr old can watch utube and play games at home. he loves it
B00PWEN2ZE,Jany,5,"Great little phone at a great price. Since I rarely use a cellphone, this is ideal for me."
B00PWEN2ZE,Lauren,2,"Does what we need it to, but has such little amount of hard drive space. I didn't. Expect that."
B00PWEN2ZE,Dennis R.,5,I have used Tracfone services for over ten years. The Moto E performance through Tracfone is excellent.
B00PWEN2ZE,Beth K.,4,It was what I expected and a little more for the price !
B00PWEN2ZE,Jim,5,This phone works so much better than the ZTE junk phone that I replace. I did'ent know how bad the ZTE was until I started using the Moto E.
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert L. Jackson Jr.,5,my brother loves this phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,3,"The phone is a 3G and I am going from a 4G, but I will not have a monthly bill, with an insurance, data plan, and charge for text messaging
every month. So the trade off just might be okay. But the phone will not pick up my bluetooth, I don't understand the difficulty."
B00PWEN2ZE,15ironross,4,"First smart phone still learning to use it. I am enjoying it. It makes good pic., sound is clear reception is good. Does everything well. Would buy again"
B00PWEN2ZE,Anna V.,1,Trac phone is not honoring the triple talk text data as advertised
B00PWEN2ZE,TradeClassicCar,1,"This Dumbphone is Complete Garbage! I purchased this as a gift to replace an older flip-top phone but I am switching everything (activation & minutes) back to the flip-top phone. The phone would not receive calls but you could place a call. I called tracfone support and waited 4 separate times, I was on hold each time for over 35 minutes. I was told to hang up and dial a code and that would take care of the problem but nothing, then I had to call back and wait another 35 minutes. I did the call back thing, they called me back and the message told me to press 1, when I did, it hung up. The Motorola software does not make it easy to just place a call, you have to press and slide to unlock then go to a different screen, too much B.S. Google is terrible as usual, you can't just use this, you need to set up an account and once you set one up, you have to sign in on a tiny screen even if you have it set to remember your login. Certain Google apps won't work and Tracfone, you need to download an app just to see how many minutes you have left but it freezes up all the time and you are unable to login to check your minutes. This was one bad purchase"
B00PWEN2ZE,B. Disbrow,1,"Don't waste your money, this phone is a piece of crap. I bought this phone right before Christmas 2014 by March 2015 it would only hold a charge for 8 hours. I contacted Amazon to complain, they told me to call Motorola.

Motorola worked with me for a month. They were nice and tried to be helpful. Finally Motorola told me to contact Tracfone. Tracfone sent me a new phone. The new phone worked for one month when other problems began. This time the problem being that I could not hear the phone ring as well as not able to hear the person I was speaking to nor could they hear me. I called Tracfone but was not happy with their service. They had me reset the phone to factory settings which did not improve anything. I asked if I could exchange this phone for another but was told no.

It is now July 2015 and am disgusted with this phone and the service I received. While I was happy with my Tracfone service in the past this phone purchase has been such a hassle that I'll be changing my phone purchase and service provider."
B00PWEN2ZE,David Humphrey,5,"Excellent phone for the money, distinctly better than Samsung phones. Sharp screen, good menus, a place to put a nice big memory chip"
B00PWEN2ZE,dina,2,"Have to BUY SEPARATE text credits wtf
Laaaaaame"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"Great price & seems to work fine,a lot better than some other phones at higher prices that I've owned."
B00PWEN2ZE,mike r,3,Keep data off and check min left on pc
B00PWEN2ZE,Erica,4,"It is what it is, it works for what I need"
B00PWEN2ZE,Mahara,5,"Met my standards ! Easy to use,not much of a problem getting it usable."
B00PWEN2ZE,mike frein,1,this product did not work and after repeated inqueries i got the run around and wasted my money!
B00PWEN2ZE,m joy,1,couldnt use this in my area and didnt find out until after I bought it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Smileyg,5,"Great phone, great price for my son!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Lady T,5,These are great starter phones for kids. My girls love their new Moto E Tracfone. They have barely put them down since they opened them on Christmas!!! Thanks Amazon & Tracfone!!!
B00PWEN2ZE,david propst,4,surprised how good the camera is...this phone fits my needs excellently...
B00PWEN2ZE,KP,3,Not enough memory to be worth more than 15 or 20 dollars.
B00PWEN2ZE,adam,4,"I bought the phone for $19.99, they just raised the price by $13. Its not bad and should do the job. I just won't buy a second one now."
B00PWEN2ZE,Columbian,4,Had to buy a 2nd one when screen cracked on the first... Otherwise a good phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Melanie Ziriax,3,"it was a refurbished phone. had some flaws and gave some problems, but for a phone that is not every single day use then it ain't to bad."
B00PWEN2ZE,Cat,3,Not as used friendly as Gramma hoped.
B00PWEN2ZE,Joe,1,Returned it. Operating system is too old and can't be upgraded.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,"It wouldn't update. Tracfone replaced with a better phone, but I was without a phone for two weeks."
B00PWEN2ZE,Char J,5,Nice telephone ! Good buy!
B00PWEN2ZE,Olive Chaser,3,worked great no longer have the phone
B00PWEN2ZE,tom bissell,5,good phone at a reasonable price
B00PWEN2ZE,barry,5,"Great phone with a fantastic price, will be ordering another one for son birthday."
B00PWEN2ZE,pat,5,"Works great,Have had no problems with it, best cell phone for me,does everything I want it to do,thank you"
B00PWEN2ZE,Gene LM,5,good size seems to have a good battery
B00PWEN2ZE,Deke,5,"I've had this phone for over a month now and it is just what I was looking for. It's a very capable and high quality android smartphone at a reasonable price.

Coupled with Tracfone service you won't find a better deal, as long as you're primarily looking for phone and texting services. Tracfone is not good if you plan to use cellular ""data"" services very much (grossly over priced), so I use wifi exclusively for data services on this phone.

Keep in mind that this is a $99 phone and not a $300 to $600 phone. Don't expect a top quality camera and 4G LTE service at this price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Mary F. Henson,5,"Great phone for the price, and no contract. Also, my kid dropped it (rather hard) and the glass came away without damage. Gorilla glass is the stuff."
B00PWEN2ZE,Dina M Abernahy,5,Im Loving it. Wish I had gotten this one first.
B00PWEN2ZE,Tony,5,Very nice phone... just needed a higher OS
B00PWEN2ZE,P Meyer,5,Excellent. Great price and also came with triple minutes. Tracfone transferred all my minutes over from my old phone. Kept the same phone #.
B00PWEN2ZE,adam turner,1,all i needed it for was a mp3 player and the headphone jack stop working so it was useless for me
B00PWEN2ZE,Lisa Sorenson,1,"Did not come with directions, can't run the tone."
B00PWEN2ZE,tikkicat,5,Bought to replace flip type Trak Phone. Now I have to learn how to use it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Evvi Gless,5,Absolutely love this phone. Would compare to much more expensive ones and Prepaid is the absolute best
B00PWEN2ZE,Weekend Worker,5,"For the cost of this phone I have been amazed at the quality and ease of use. It compares well with my wife's Galaxy III, which was much more expensive."
B00PWEN2ZE,David Comeau,5,Overall pretty happy with the phone. I know some reviews weren't favorable but its a pretty good Android Tracfone. It was an upgrade for me and has many features. I would recommend it
B00PWEN2ZE,Susan M. Lundgren,4,I got this phone October 2016 and in January 2017 the speaker stopped working
B00PWEN2ZE,Mike,4,"I don't depend upon a phone for when I am mobile.
90 percent of my needs are met with my voip landline and wifi thru my tablet and even this phone.
So, if your life depends upon a cell phone you would not be using a prepaid service like TracFone.
You'd have a real cell phone plan.

I've had the TracFone service since 2005 and this is my first experience with their Android phone offerings.

But for those who only need to keep in touch with important calls while away from home this Moto E performs well and delivers value to me and is a very good choice for Android phone newbies. But not for professionals who depend their lives upon a phone.

Just for kicks and giggles, I loaded the Netflix app onto this phone and watched a movie.
I guess that makes me part of the gang now...

If you are a newbie and don't plan to depend upon a phone for important work, this is a very good choice."
B00PWEN2ZE,Count dTen,4,Much better than my earlier smart-tracfone (a ZTE). I'm beginning to see why people like them.
B00PWEN2ZE,Angela Magnano,5,Nice little Trac phone...Am very pleased with it and excellent price...
B00PWEN2ZE,catlover,5,"The phone so far was good, price was nice as well. So far it is the best choice for tracfone system."
B00PWEN2ZE,Patricia Sherman,4,So far I like the phone. Good battery life was easy to switch from my old phone. Wish they would include user book.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,nice
B00PWEN2ZE,Ruth,5,"As described, easy to use and activate."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jonnie,4,"I have been extremely happy with this phone! The Gorilla Glass is amazing. No scratches,scuffs,etc. Ease of downloading apps. Video quality is very good. I love the Google talk feature. Great value!"
B00PWEN2ZE,uscruisers,4,I have been very happy with this phone. Meets all of my needs
B00PWEN2ZE,Dic,5,I am pleased with this purchase. After getting it registered everything seems to be working as it should.
B00PWEN2ZE,Peg Woody,5,"Finally moved up from a flip phone. I seldom use it, but as a senior I feel I have the need to carry a phone. 1200 min will last me forever!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Ship here,1,Terrible! This is all I can say about the experience.
B00PWEN2ZE,The Lamp Lighter,5,Great Tracfone at an excellent price.
B00PWEN2ZE,tom,5,Excellent price runs on Verizon network
B00PWEN2ZE,littlec,5,Great little starter phone for the kid that wants to fit in. He was happy. I control the minutes. all is well.
B00PWEN2ZE,WAW,5,"This Moto E is a perfect phone for me. I've had tracfone for over 18 years n now use it as back up.
I Love the Moto E."
B00PWEN2ZE,Istvan Bocsi,5,"Awesome phone snappy , sharp screen everything works fine.
One minor hickup, it won't read qr code due to the fixed focus of the camera."
B00PWEN2ZE,Daphne Gilliland,3,wasn't what my elderly dad could use
B00PWEN2ZE,Joanne Robrahn,5,Great phone. Great price!
B00PWEN2ZE,Pixie Superstar,5,Had it for over a year now. Not much memory but it does the trick. Probably last another year or two!
B00PWEN2ZE,William Dworzan,5,"About as good as a 150$ phone, I love it, a great bargain."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kirk,5,You seriously can't beat the value of this phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,works just fine for my uses. I am not one who lives on my phone like so many these days.
B00PWEN2ZE,Brynna,5,Very nice phone. Quality surpassed my expectations ðð¾
B00PWEN2ZE,Margaret Mc Donald,5,Very happy with this phone. It is exactly what I wanted. I have found no problems with it so far.
B00PWEN2ZE,Judith Martin,4,"This is an excellent phone. I would give it five stars but I could not get the back open despite watching several videos on Youtube. I finally took it to a tech place that deals in phones and computers to install the 32 gig memory card. The tech guy fumbled for a couple of minutes saying, ""Wow, this sucker is really on here!"" until it finally popped open under his capable hands. I had bruised my fingernails struggling with the thing for 20 minutes and more. Ow. The 5MP camera takes great pictures. Internet connection feels seamless. I hate how tight the unit is sealed, but other than that I love, love, love it. People with small hands, I would advise you to insert the micro memory card before you put the back on the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,D. lopez,5,"Great, cheap phone"
B00PWEN2ZE,Howard W.Lucas,5,I do not usea cell phone very much this one isperfect for me
B00PWEN2ZE,Larry J. Graves,4,"Nice phone, I think, it is my 1st smartphone ! Needs to have a better explanation of features and how they work for we first timers. Cannot complain about the quality and usage so far. Overall a nice phone for what I bought it for."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Great phone! Can hardly believe it was less than $50.
B00PWEN2ZE,Debe Dahlke,5,Very pleased. Works very well and the battery lasts the longest from all the phones I tried. Triple minutes is a plus!
B00PWEN2ZE,Josh,4,works great
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Nice prepaid phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Dimond Bob,4,"Small powerful droid, perfect for mans breast pocket. With Tracfone Value plan, all need for less that 20 dollars a month for two."
B00PWEN2ZE,George M. Straznitskas,5,"At $69, this is a great smartphone. I'm a Tracfone diehard and this phone is a great step up for me."
B00PWEN2ZE,J. E. Sherman,4,Really enjoy this product.
B00PWEN2ZE,Jeff,3,bought for my 10yr old son and is great for what he needs it for
B00PWEN2ZE,T. Ptak,5,"Excellent phone, excellent price. Activation on line was a breeze. Had no problem transporting my old cell phone number to this phone. Also had no problem transferring unused minutes from my old Tracphone to this phone.

Touch screen works perfectly. In the horizontal position the keyboard is large enough to permit typing even with my stubby fingers.

Most people with Version service can not get reception within my home. This phone uses the Version network and has had no problem getting reception anywhere within my home.

To date I have no negative comments whatsoever. Liked the phone so much I ordered another one for my wife."
B00PWEN2ZE,publicname,4,Great for wifi phone calls...No front facing camera for hangouts
B00PWEN2ZE,Lucky Dog,5,"Works great, slow for a 3g network but that depends on where you are."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pocono4,5,Great
B00PWEN2ZE,Tom S,5,Top of the line for the money. Performs as well as my son's I Phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,JR,5,"Love this basic phone, perfect for my needs."
B00PWEN2ZE,Precious McClendon,5,Was a gift for my sister and she loves it also a nice little phone for a first timer.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,3,"It seems every time I purchase a newer, better Tracfone that they work as a phone in fewer areas. This one works great as a PDA in most of the areas I travel to when visiting family as there's no data coverage there. I hoped that I could just turn off the data and use it as a cell phone. The Androids don't work that way. Pretty good phone if you have coverage otherwise."
B00PWEN2ZE,Calspete,5,"Great price, comes with a card for service addition, and works great."
B00PWEN2ZE,Dudley,5,This is a great phone-friends can't believe the price. Am learning new things everyday about the phone. Love it.
B00PWEN2ZE,PBrady,4,I Love the triple minutes that it gives and my Daughter loved all it's features
B00PWEN2ZE,joseph s zelazny,4,"VERY CLEAR, EASY TO OPERATE, JUST WHAT OLDER PEOPLE REQUIRE."
B00PWEN2ZE,Andy,2,"Bought 2 of these, when they work their fine but the sound on both quit and now as a phone or radio they are quite useless, would never buy another one"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"I like this phone so far, I've only had it for about a month and have had no problems!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Todd,5,"Phone works great, no bad issues at all."
B00PWEN2ZE,Terri Potts,2,This phone is hit or miss!It drops calls or doesn't alert you to a call or text.....I know it's cheap but I got it for calls and nothing else
B00PWEN2ZE,RUSSELL WAYNE WHEELER,5,"So far the phone is well worth the price, expected a piece of junk for the price paid but am happily proven wrong."
B00PWEN2ZE,Kurt Watson,5,Perfect! have had for several months and works flawlessly.
B00PWEN2ZE,Tri,5,take time to learn how to use this phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"I love my phone, not an IPhone, but is the best I have had thus far"
B00PWEN2ZE,Arthanella Coffey,5,Love it!
B00PWEN2ZE,Barbara M. Florida,5,Does everything I need at a very reasonable price.
B00PWEN2ZE,Ole Geezer,3,I sent it back never opened it.. We played games on is the phone unlocked or not unlocked. From buying Tracfone in the past at time of purchase the phone is unlocked at point of sale or it had a XXXXXXX code number you enter in the phone which gives you 7-10 minutes of air time. Enough to add your air minutes . And the other item that I could not find was is it compatible to the carriers in my dialing area. I found this out by accident when I previously purchased a Tracfone. That phone was not compatible with local carrier used on the Tracfone network.. so I have no cell phone coverage at the house.. drive a mile down the road and I have 5 bars of coverage. And I have asked till I am blue in the face and can't get a straight answer from Tracfone or any one else
B00PWEN2ZE,Joe & Stephanie,5,We liked the 1st of these; we bought a 2nd one. Price was much better than the original refurbished one we bought from Tracfone.
B00PWEN2ZE,George E. Smith,4,"only had it a short time, but i like it. seems of good quality and just the right size"
B00PWEN2ZE,JIm,5,Phone works well have been using this a while with out any issues

B00PWEN2ZE,Jon Michael Webb,1,Phone is very outdated at this point.
B00PWEN2ZE,Mantis,5,If you need a phone that won't break the bank this is the phone to get. I love it!
B00PWEN2ZE,james k,4,"Like the phone a lot, easy and reasonably fast, battery charges quickly and holds a charge depending on apps...2 or 3 days for mine, and as with all android phones is Google loaded and I hate most of Google....very very intrusive"
B00PWEN2ZE,Pamela C. Anderson,3,3G is not enough
B00PWEN2ZE,Roland Postier,5,Works great.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,Love these! Cheap way for my teenagers to have a phone without breaking the bank.
B00PWEN2ZE,Phil Mattoon,4,Best Tracfone so far. Needs more internal storage. Can't down load movies from Dish Anywhere to SD card and can't move app to SD card. Works well with Strava. No complaints.
B00PWEN2ZE,Mr Pink,1,"I really liked this phone, enough to buy another one as a spare. Sadly my like turned to distaste after less than one month and less than 10 phone calls. The phone itself is not bad. It has a few quirks that I didn't like, like the inability to turn the Wi-Fi completely off. The phone was constantly hunting undesirable Wi-Fi networks even after I turned Wi-Fi off and the 3g on. The main problem is that Tracfone will delete your minutes. A google search will reveal that this is a common problem. A call to customer service ended with rep telling me that -""sorry we can't restore any minutes"". I only lost about 90 minutes but I read horror stories about many many more vanishing. I could never trust Tracfone again. My spare, still unopened and in the shipping box is for sale."
B00PWEN2ZE,Robb Florida,4,nice phone
B00PWEN2ZE,Teresa,5,This phone is great for my needs. Don't need a lot of bells and whistles. Everything transferred with no problems. It operates much faster than my previous phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Cooper,5,"Good, basic, Android smartphone. Would definitely recommend for Tracfone users."
B00PWEN2ZE,Patricia,5,It's a great phone and very easy to use. I'm very happy with it!
B00PWEN2ZE,Patricia Montenegro,4,fast and well made
B00PWEN2ZE,Colleen Wong,5,Yes it works so well...Just the perfect size.... I really love this phone...
B00PWEN2ZE,Madeline A. Wheeler,5,I like the phone it is just taken me awhile to get use a smart phone!
B00PWEN2ZE,Nay,1,It just stop to work 25 days later!
B00PWEN2ZE,James Walker,5,Great phone for a basic phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Charlie,4,I really like it but the time and date is sometimes off but will reset after a day or so. Because of this I do not trust it as an alarm. Would buy again.
B00PWEN2ZE,Gary in AZ,5,Works great !
B00PWEN2ZE,B. Rickman,4,Smaller than I thought it would be but a nice phone for a first time smart phone user

B00PWEN2ZE,Marlin L.,5,"I've had several smart phones but this one is the smartest. I'm on TracFone pay as you go because i don't use a cell phone a lot. I love the Moto-E for TracFone. Everything about this phone is awesome. I highly recommend this phone. Be sure you get the right one for the service provider you intend to use it on. ie-TracFone, ATT, Straight Talk etc etc."

B00PWEN2ZE,dadgamer,5,"This may be the second review (but we bought three Moto E so far). My wife uses trackfone for over 7 years, but now she loves this $50 smartphone with tracfone."

B00PWEN2ZE,ARG,2,"I really liked this phone at first because it was a step up from my non-smartphones in the past. It always had storage issues though; I couldn't add many apps at all, so that was disappointing. I liked having the internet and Facebook though. The biggest disappointment was that it only lasted 8 months and now has a frozen loading screen. I troubleshooted with the manufacturer and now have to wait on a replacement phone. Hopefully my pictures were saved on Google photos or my SD card, otherwise I have lost them and anything else saved on the phone. The pictures were usually grainy and blurry though so I suppose it's not a huge loss."
B00PWEN2ZE,arthur straley,1,"no sound after 4 months. i must rate this as a lemon at best, or perhaps it is just garbage"

Not user friendly for seniors. Hard to get use to"
B00PWEN2ZE,Bryan McKnight,5,"An amazing phone for the price. It's everything I need, and the phone works! Other phones I used previously thru Tracfone did not work and had to be discarded."

B00PWEN2ZE,Brad,5,Bought for $46. Used for about a month. No problems setting up or transferring minutes from previous Tracfone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Good phone for the price. Directly replaced a broken one. The switch over (migrate) was easy to do.
B00PWEN2ZE,jimpietz,1,"I had this piece of garbage for less than three months. I'm done. For a second time in this small amount of time, I had to do a factory reset after a complete lock up and battery gauge calibration snafu. Only this time, after the reset and two hours charging, it still showed no charge. Tried restarting it again and then it wouldn't boot at all. I did nothing different on any of the three resets, it just stopped working on the third one. Besides, in about ten weeks time, it shouldn't have needed to be restored ONCE, let alone three times. I was hardly rough on this worthless POS, either. Texts, Facebook messenger and Fallout Shelter...that's about it. Simply put, this thing is just unreliable. I will give it this, though; it's physically very tough. I found this out in my frustration, throwing it into a wall several times.

This thing is cheap. But remember, as I was reminded; you get what you pay for. Spend a few extra dollars and get something reliable. I just did."
B00PWEN2ZE,jo,4,good product for the price
B00PWEN2ZE,LWisconsin,5,Great Deal from seller. Loved them.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,4,"I like the phone, but it may be more than I need. I will need to get used to it as I have never had an Android phone before."
B00PWEN2ZE,GrC,5,Great product
B00PWEN2ZE,JayBee,5,I'm very happy with this phone. It serves my needs (which are simple) very well. And Tracfone has worked well for me for years.
B00PWEN2ZE,Rich K.,4,working quite nicely so far- a good product

B00PWEN2ZE,BOOPAH,5,I love this phone. It's better than the Samsung 3g phone. It even has FM radio. I really love this phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Cool poster,5,Love this phone.it replaced an older phone and this on is 100% better.
B00PWEN2ZE,Aphillips,5,Great phone

B00PWEN2ZE,Tammy Clark,5,"Bought this for my sons birthday, He loves it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Stresa,5,Bought 2 of these phones for my kids. The phones run great and the kids love them. Best budget phone on the market imho.
B00PWEN2ZE,juan,5,excelent
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,It works great the sound on this is absolutely the best ever. Storage is awful. U can only have 3 apps. But 4 calls n text it is great.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,3,The Motorola Moto E Android phone this is the second one that I have owned had the have used Tracfones every since the flip phones. I alway been will satisfied and the cost of airtime has alway been fair. Although my daughter-in-law and I purchase our first Android about a month apart and either by chance or the set up of the phone we got almost the exact same thing happen after about a year both of our phones froze and we had to purchase new phones. Was this just a coincidence I don't know. Now I never had the problem with my data been used up so fast with my other phone I have to keep purchasing MGB so i don't know if I would tell someone to purchase this type of phone or not. Some plus's and also minus with this phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Heidi B,5,"Excellent shipping, as described."
B00PWEN2ZE,Al,4,"Only reason for not a 5 star rating is lack of rear facing camera and no flash or auto focus. However, in this price range, it should not be expected."

B00PWEN2ZE,john hughes,5,Good Phone
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,it wasn't for safelink user
B00PWEN2ZE,Sarah D.,2,"I bought this phone for my mom as her first smartphone. It's not worked right since day one. I only downloaded Facebook, Facebook Messenger and the Tracfone app since I knew there wasn't much onboard memory. I moved the Facebook apps to an SD card. I learned six months later that the phone always dropped calls, so she can't talk on it.

I recommended this phone to another family member who went out and bought it right off. Within a week he was getting the full memory warnings. At two months in, it froze on startup and never turned on.

If all you want to do is text, this will work for you. If you want to use this like a smartphone, continue looking elsewhere."
B00PWEN2ZE,Donald A Nicholson,4,It works well as an emergency cell phone for our lives. D & D.
B00PWEN2ZE,Gabriel Palmer,5,everything great!
B00PWEN2ZE,sheila spak,5,Very nice phone for the price!
B00PWEN2ZE,Whirligig,3,"The description says the phone ""Includes: battery, USB cable, wall charger, activation guide and Tracfone services guide."" The USB cable is hard-wired into the wall charger and is not a separate piece. Please change the description. I bought this for my mother for an emergency phone and so she can listen to audiblebooks and music, and the USB cable was one of the featured accessories that mad this phone attractive to buy. We had to spend another $20 in town to buy a USB cable so that I can transfer books and music. Other than the lack of the cable, it appears to be satisfactory for my 82 year old mother. The font can be changed to extra large. The icons are smaller than my iPhone and will be difficult for her to see, but if we put the most important for her at the beginning, it should be ok. I haven't found a way to increase the icon size. There's no app to write notes and that's what she mostly uses her existing phone for grocery lists, so I have to find an app she can use. The camera is good for pictures and will zoom."
B00PWEN2ZE,n/a,4,Works very well.
B00PWEN2ZE,Jennifer,5,Purchased for my mom who is a senior - her first phone since a flip phone. She likes it very much and is able to use it with confidence.
B00PWEN2ZE,D. J.,5,My wife loves it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Suzanne Siberz,5,"I love my new phone, especially the triple minutes."
B00PWEN2ZE,Starr,5,My fiancee loves this phone! It has all the new updates. $50 very well spent!
B00PWEN2ZE,David K Hodges,5,Had one before and dropped it. Best phone I have ever had
B00PWEN2ZE,Earle H. Baldwin,5,"More than I hoped,,, the real deal"
B00PWEN2ZE,Andy N.,5,I Have been pleased with the kind of use I get out of this. It's what I wanted in a phone
B00PWEN2ZE,Ileana,5,Very good for my needs.
B00PWEN2ZE,Melinda Whitman,5,This is the best phone I've owned so far.
B00PWEN2ZE,Superbaby,4,"I really like this phone, but it has just 3 gb of storage & with all the crap that comes pre-loaded (& can't be removed), it's really hard to add anything I actually use. Moving apps to a microSD is no option, as I've learned, because you can't update them there & then you get these stupid messages saying just that every time these apps try to update. So, I'm constantly clearing caches, removing apps, & moving stuff around to make everything fit. Still a big improvement over my previous Tracfone tho."
B00PWEN2ZE,Christopher Estep,4,"He bought this for my preteen daughter to be able to watch some video over Wi-Fi. It's not fast. It doesn't have a lot of storage. But what it does have is Kitkat and an SD card spot and it plays video and Minecraft Pocket just fine. It was super cheap so I have literally no complaints about it. I can't say anything as far as voice quality or anything about TracFone service or anything like that. But as a Wi-Fi video streaming device, it gets the job done and I'm happy with it. Best of all it was cheap."
B00PWEN2ZE,brokenshovel,5,It took a longtime but Tracfone actually has one good phone now.
B00PWEN2ZE,MandM,5,love it
B00PWEN2ZE,John P Muise,5,"Bought this because I needed a cheap music player when I take my walks. For $20, it's well worth the price even though you have to buy minutes to use it as a phone. I like that it's fairly compact and fits in my shirt pocket. I also bought a 32GB SD card to go with it so I can load up music and store plenty of pictures. Basically, I just needed a really small tablet."
B00PWEN2ZE,Shelli McMillen Soto,5,Great phone for a great price.
B00PWEN2ZE,elisa k.,4,nice phone... I only would like to know if a can text to another cellphone overseas...the intenational call is using my data minutes so I have to find out how to get it to use the phone minutes..
B00PWEN2ZE,Big Al,5,This was a great deal for me to give as a gift to my grandson. My husband had the same phone but on another carrier and it is a great phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,2,not enough directions on use of different sites. have to plug it in after a short time so as not to run out of power
B00PWEN2ZE,M. Brooks Michel,5,THIS TELEPHONE SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS. IT EVEN RECEIVES FRENCH TELEVISION. THE SOUND QUALITY IS AMAZING.
B00PWEN2ZE,Sett Balise,5,"It's a real smartphone with a tracfone plan, what more is there to say...been waiting for this for a long time. It isn't a powerhouse of a phone, but it'll play Clash of Clans and a bunch of other Android games just fine, has a big screen that's touch sensitive, and the android it ships with isn't overwhelmed with bloated junk apps."
B00PWEN2ZE,Naomi Holt,5,It's the right size for my hands and the screen is what I needed. Thank you.
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert N. Kuehl,4,"a little overwhelming at first. my first experience with an android phone, but as I use it, really like it"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"still learning about all the features, but has worked well so far"
B00PWEN2ZE,Paul F. Wein Jr.,4,"Good Phone, Great Price, Fantastic Service!"
B00PWEN2ZE,David M,4,"I bought this phone to replace a Tracfone flip phone of my daughter's (she is 13 years old). I transferred the number from the old phone to this phone online through my Tracfone.com account. The entire process took around 10 minutes and the new phone was up and running. I have never owned a smart phone before, but I'm fairly competent on electronics. I guess bottom line she is happy with it and likes it. There is no flash and no front camera, but she will live. She is happy to get out of the dark ages. The only concern I had was smart phones using a lot of data. I just turned off the mobile data function, so she has to do everything in Wi-Fi. I told her if she really needed to, to enable mobile data, and do what she needed to real quick and turn it off.

The two things I don't like are this. One, it seems to be ruled by Google, and it wasn't you (and it is easier) to set up a google account to get the apps and stuff. I'd prefer it to be Amazon friendly. I still downloaded the Amazon app so she can use the Amazon app store, but going with Google, seems to be what the phone wants you to do. Two, you can't check your service days and remaining minutes/texts/data, unless you install an app that wants to connect to the internet (thru Wi-Fi or mobile data) to tell your status. The old phone had it quickly available, this you have to wait for the circle of death to quit spinning to tell you what you have left. Seems to me it should be easy to get information, not requiring extra steps.

Also I have read that a text isn't .33 minutes, it is a full 1 minute deduction. I don't care for that either. But instead of spending 1000 dollars a year for a smart phone, as of right now, this seems to be a more reasonable compromise."
B00PWEN2ZE,becca,5,Great reception ..best cell phone I have owned... good bargain for the $$$

B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Works great!
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,This is a great cell phone for the price and you get triple minutes from Tracfone when you buy a Tracfone minutes card. Has everything I want in a cell phone.

B00PWEN2ZE,C. D. Lusk,1,"Horrible. This phone never really worked begin with. From the time I activated it; the phone would never hold a charge or would not charge at all. Since I waited a couple weeks to activate it, because it is a secondary phone, I am outside the return policy date and cannot return it. I would not return it anyway because it is completely dead so I cannot erase my information from it. I have also lost the money I paid for service on the phone, which will not transfer. I have a new paperweight or shooting target I guess"
B00PWEN2ZE,Niemand_Hektik,5,The best lower priced Android phone out there. The value is incredible.

B00PWEN2ZE,Rich1962,5,best cell phone I ever had
B00PWEN2ZE,michael randall,1,"I have tried and tried for two months to set up and am so lost and overwhelmed by what a mess I've created and the absolute lack of a cohesive one place instruction guide and answers to the most simple questions or the need to inherently know what you are doing in the first place. It wont sync with any google account, passwords wont match, how to post pics, which app works , why are there 3 camera apps and where do they store, and google can't be reached is the best I have encountered,a need to # change and I transfered 800 minutes from one tracfone to this one! HELP!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Zanella Arts,1,Well the charging port was broken & it didn't power on.
B00PWEN2ZE,gentle36man,4,This is a really good phone for the price! Especially on the Tracfone network!
B00PWEN2ZE,Angelgirl,5,Great price.
B00PWEN2ZE,MaryAnn Hobbs,3,Too complicated for me. Miss my flip phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,MaryJo B.,5,this is a great phone for the price
B00PWEN2ZE,victor,4,Solid phone but I was expecting more battery optimization for the hardware compromises made. It a sub HD screen definitely worth the money fits my day to day smartphone needs.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"Great smartphone for an affordable price. Glass feels stronger than others. I used up all the internal storage with apps but with an affordable SD card, we can store music and pictures of normal range. I found the Motorola personal assistance program that comes with the machine very helpful."
B00PWEN2ZE,Alexis64,1,"I wanted an inexpensive Android phone as a backup to my iPhone, but the KitKat 4.4.4 OS on this phone is so outdated that the first app I tried will not install on it. (No O/S updates are available for this device.) I feel that I've wasted my time and money."
B00PWEN2ZE,NoahThePro98,4,Amazing!
B00PWEN2ZE,Dian Ryder,4,Great product at very little cost!
B00PWEN2ZE,Kenneth E. Gastineau,4,Great choice for Tracfone smartphone.

B00PWEN2ZE,oofaloofa,5,no complaints at all. does what I need it to do.
B00PWEN2ZE,Stephen L Basty,5,Good phone value that works great with wifi. No problems
B00PWEN2ZE,Mitch,5,"This was supposed to be an upgrade for my husband's old ZTE Valet. Out of the box it was great...got everything transferred over with no problem, nice sized screen, easy to navigate. My hubby is a little hard of hearing and apparently setting the ringer volume on high isn't exactly the way you would think. I don't know if the phone comes from the factory this way or what, but every ringtone I chose, sounded nice and loud while testing, however when making a call to the phone the ring starts out barely audible then the second ring goes louder, then it goes back to barely audible. This won't work! By the time he could hear it and get it out of his pocket to answer, it goes to VM.
Who ever heard of a phone that, even though the ringer volume is set to high, starts so low it can barely be heard.
That is a huge deal breaker for me.
I've put out a question on the Motorola support website regarding this. Maybe I just got a lemon, but it won't work for me this way, so I'm returning it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Good product.
B00PWEN2ZE,Barbara's only cognition,4,Excellent value
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,Bought the phone about 8 months ago. At first I liked it.. it seemed to do whatever asked of it. (talking and sending texts) I am careful with it.. bought a case and didnt even put it in my pocket because I didnt want to break the glass. Yesterday I noticed a crack in the glass which soon grew to cover the whole front of the phone. Now there are other cracks making the phone useless.. am now looking for a phone with tougher glass.. maybe the new gorilla glass... Rj
B00PWEN2ZE,Randy Tapley,5,So far working great! Very happy with it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Thirtysomething Reader,4,"Since this is not a very widely used phone, it's difficult to find case for it, so the screen cracks very easily. I left it in my bag and it came out with the screen looking like cracked ice. It needs more built-in storage space. You can't have very many apps with that little space, especially when they need to be updated. It has no face camera, which is extremely annoying for Skype calls. On the other hand, it works perfectly fine for texting and calling. Apps run quickly and smoothly. It's well worth it considering how cheap it is, but if you want something long-lasting then look elsewhere for a phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"Good budget smartphone. Quick and prompt delivery, no question about it. Thanks!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Bush1,5,Awesome phone for the money.
B00PWEN2ZE,Mary,5,"Excellent basic phone. Not for someone who wants to live on the 'net with it, but if you want a nice display (256 ppi); iPad3 is 264,
and a 3g basic phone you can't beat it. It only has 2 gb of free ROM, but I popped a 16 SD card in it. I'll never fill it up."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jack Pond,4,does what is expected. very pleased.
B00PWEN2ZE,John (jack) Martin,5,As advertised. No dificulties.
B00PWEN2ZE,Alan,5,Best for a person who doesn't blab a lot on his cell phone. Beats monthly contracted service carriers easily. I'll never go back.

B00PWEN2ZE,Dogtired,5,"For a $20 smart phone, you can't find anything better. Period. Now if TracFone would FINAL!Y push through the Android Lollipop upgrade, it would be AWSOME!! TRACFONE, GET OFF YER BUTTS AND FIX IT!!!!! Called Android and they said they pushed it to you MONTHS ago! Come on! Why not make your customers HAPPY????"
B00PWEN2ZE,Sherri Johnson,5,EVERYTHING WORKS GREAT !!
B00PWEN2ZE,T Markworth,3,"There is almost nothing good about this phone. I had it for a very short time and hated almost everything about it. Luckily, I broke the digitizer and replaced it with a garbage Alcatel droid.

Some good parts. The CPU is very fast and the screen is very good. Sound quality is good when it actually works (which is almost never). Bad parts? Basically everything else.

It's one of these phones that uses an emulated SD card, so programs that don't let you manage storage (such as Gospel Library) will be a huge problem. The phone itself only has 2GB, so good luck getting much of anything on this phone if you can't put it on the SD slot. Good thing that happens to be most programs. Did I mention you can't root this phone? You can't root this phone.

Like 99% of capacitive touch screens, the touch typing is horrid. Get a keyboard immediately. And I hope you've got money to burn on a bluetooth handset (or love hands free) because in my experience, almost all of my calls ended as a result of my face hitting the screen and it hanging up. Thanks, garbage touch screen. But at least the picture looks really good.

And back to the topic of bluetooth gluing stuff to the phone, the sound situation is a disaster. For whatever reason, only speaker phone is reliable. You seriously need to get some method of actually making calls with this thing, even if you just carry a bluetooth receiver around with you.

Battery life is poor doing anything except nothing. That's not entirely true. It does ok in programs with a mostly black screen. Still, power bank or wall socket recommended."
B00PWEN2ZE,John Seelhammer,2,was unable to activate fone

B00PWEN2ZE,Billie Voss,1,"This was a birthday gift for my grandson and after 3 months track phone refused to service it any longer saying it was obsolete. The phone is no use to him or anyone else. Now I have to get him a new phone. If I had known this I would have never bought it in the first place,"
B00PWEN2ZE,Barbara A. Grove,1,called customer service to have it activated was on the phone for over an hour with agent then was told it is not compatible for my service area. West Virginia and Winchester Va. The next day tried to call again with no luck getting ahold of someone and the phone says it activated but unable to call it or call out from it. Also had paid for extra card. Waste of money
B00PWEN2ZE,shk,1,"The battery compartment can't be opened. The phone system wouldn't recognize that there were still 117 texts available. After 3 hours on customer support chats, tracfone said it was Motorola's problem, and Motorola said it was tracfone's problem. If I could give it negative stars, I would."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,Upgrade from tracfone flipphone like very much.

B00PWEN2ZE,nicolekayeo,5,"I bought this phone for my boyfriend. It was very easy to transfer all of his contacts and minutes from the old phone to this one. After having it for a month he is very satisfied with the quality of the phone. This is the best inexpensive smartphone thatI have ever purchased for tracfone, I would definitely recommend it for someone who would like smartphone capabilities but doesn't want to spend the money for all of the unnecessary features."
B00PWEN2ZE,Brogan,5,"Better than I expected, works great."
B00PWEN2ZE,Brian Quinn,4,A good phone

B00PWEN2ZE,Lyndley Warren,2,I've had the phone for a little over a year and have really liked it. Just this week the sound cuts out. I can no longer hear incoming calls or notifications of text messages. Disappointed that it did not work out. Now I'm on the hunt for another phone to be used with Tracfone.
B00PWEN2ZE,EdW,4,Completely satisfied other than the camera doesn't auto focus.
B00PWEN2ZE,Vicki,1,"For the first 4 months I was extremely happy with the Motorola Moto E Android prepaid phone. Worked perfectly without any glitches that I was aware of. Then I took a trip to Alaska and discovered that my phone was totally useless - absolutely no outgoing or incoming of ANY kind. This phone uses Verizon towers which Alaska has. My husband has an older LG tracfone which worked fine even in the middle of the ocean! I called Tracfone and they assured me that as long as I was in the US my phone should work - NOT!!!! Now, my audio constantly fails for no reason. There is no sound for alarm clock, incoming texts & phone calls & notifications, or video. I've done everything advisable except remove the well-protected battery. Because I've no idea if anyone is calling or texting, or if my alarm will ever ring, this phone has become unreliable. I did discover this is 1 of 7 common issues with this phone that people complain most often about. I would not recommend purchasing this phone as you will have frustrating issues with it in a few months. Since these issues are common to this phone, it would be senseless to accept a replacement of the same phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Richard C O'Brien,5,nice phone
B00PWEN2ZE,robert f murphy,5,i absolutely love the phone than you.
B00PWEN2ZE,J. C. Wheeler,5,"Wow...for a $99 phone this is a dream. My last phone was a Samsung, also a 3G phone but terrible. It butt dialed all the time and the battery was lousy. This phone's camera is OK for my purpose. The Google Android OS is fantastic. It does all I need. The screen resolution is wonderful. I like the extra 50 GB of Google Cloud included. My carrier is Tracfone and it is very cheap. It works by default on WiFi saving me money...Yes I would buy it again. Tracfone gave me a power supply and a back cover. They could of included a headset but for that price who is complaining?"
B00PWEN2ZE,A. George,4,This would be a great little phone if it weren't for the incredibly small amount of actual phone memory. In other words expect to only have literally one or two apps installed at any given time (unless you want to mess around with risky apps that will force other apps to be installed onto an sd card)
B00PWEN2ZE,tom charles,4,Excellent phone for the money
B00PWEN2ZE,KB USA,3,"Decent phone but crappy camera. No good for bar code scanners. Other issue I have is the contact list if you go to edit it, it's very sensitive and it dials that contact. Otherwise Happy with the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Julie Carpenter,5,About time Tracfone stepped up to the plate and got a real phone!

B00PWEN2ZE,LWisconsin,5,Great Deal from seller. Loved them.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,4,"I like the phone, but it may be more than I need. I will need to get used to it as I have never had an Android phone before."
B00PWEN2ZE,GrC,5,Great product
B00PWEN2ZE,JayBee,5,I'm very happy with this phone. It serves my needs (which are simple) very well. And Tracfone has worked well for me for years.
B00PWEN2ZE,Rich K.,4,working quite nicely so far- a good product
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Love the phones..
B00PWEN2ZE,BOOPAH,5,I love this phone. It's better than the Samsung 3g phone. It even has FM radio. I really love this phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,Headphone jack was defective which is not an inherent problem until you factor in that the replacement that was sent had the exact same issue. Headphones (and I tried innumerable different sets) do not play consistently. They sort of pop up a hair out of the jack & then only play if you turn them exactly right. Terrible design flaw from my perspective. Only buy if you NEVER use headphones.
B00PWEN2ZE,Sasha,4,"I like the size, and the features."
B00PWEN2ZE,Ronald W. Corts,5,"This is a great phone, and my third TracFone. I larger screen is big benefit for us older folks. I really like the way i can sync all my gmail email and phone #s. The phone is easy to use and has more bells and whistles than I will ever use. This was the best deal on Amazon for this phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Deanna Foster,1,Phone worked great for first 2 months now it shocks me and shuts off all the time it dies fast it won't send or receive texts my data won't work the only thing that comes through is calls it sucks!
B00PWEN2ZE,Boomer,5,The moto e is a great phone so far. Love it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Katheleen Williams,1,"I found this to be very user unfriendly. Having said that, I have never owned an Android phone before but I am a bit ""savvy"" when it comes to electronics, etc. There were a number of things I found difficult about this phone. I did watch various You Tube videos on the uses of this phone but not one of them included some of the things I was looking for. I eventually found them but also found them to be complicated to use. One of them was adding contacts. Because this was a Tracfone my biggest problem was having to contact their customer service for assistance and I can say in all my years of dealing w/customer service reps they are by far the worst; rude, not very helpful, and I found them to be very controlling, As a result of not being able to figure out some of these things I returned the phone and got full credit on it. For that I was very grateful, but then again that is a result of shopping on Amazon and what it is like to have really good customer service!"
B00PWEN2ZE,omar rosario,5,Very good telephon
B00PWEN2ZE,Paula Bledsoe,2,THE PHONE DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE IT CAME TO A POINT WOULD NOT CHARGE UP IM WAITING FOR MY REPLACEMENT AND IF THIS HAPPENS TO U CALL TRACK PHONE KEEP RECEIPT AND TRY TO DO THIS IS IN YOUR FIRST MONTH IF IT BRAKES DOWN CALL TRACK PHONE TO REPLACE
B00PWEN2ZE,REGINALD MCGEE,5,Great fit
B00PWEN2ZE,H. R. Holt,5,"I had purchased another Android smartphone for my Tracfone account and was unhappy with its slow operation. When I saw this Moto E and the performance it offered for the price, I quickly purchased it and am totally happy with the phone. I have a tablet as well but now use the phone for most of my Internet action. I added a 32GB micro SD card to supplement the small 2GB internal storage. The only negative in the phone is the built-in battery that can't be removed and replaced by the owner."
B00PWEN2ZE,VladM,3,"Everything's fine with this phone, except for its camera, which is the worst camera I've seen in a long time. Unrealistic colors, lack of sharpness and detail, it's basically unusable. If camera is not important to you - buy it with confidence."
B00PWEN2ZE,Nancy Gilbert,5,It is meeting my expections.
B00PWEN2ZE,the shopper,3,"Love the phone Hate google and trying to pair this up with gmail NIGHTMARE. This is now a new review, new moto E. It arrived without a sim card. Had to stay with this phone as my watch is pared with it. Still awful, still awful google."
B00PWEN2ZE,Patricia Rumbaugh,5,Great phone love it!
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,3,"I read about a great many phones and looked over the phones of friends. Knowing that I lacked funds for the initial expense of a modern phone or the monthly fee of a cell plan led to low expectations, but an effort to make the most of it. This phone may be the best I could do within what tracfone had to offer. I tried byop a
phone, but it didn't work. I hope I can get a few years use from this phone or a job that will allow improved resources--""as good as I can do "" is probably the right answer."
B00PWEN2ZE,T. Barnett,3,"This was my first purchase of a smart-phone, and it's anything but. The wifi turns on all by itself and runs the limited capacity fixed battery down fast. Parameters automatically reset all by themselves and notifications are turned off so you don't now when you've been sent texts. I'm glad that I didn't spend more than $20.00 on this because it would not have been worth it."
B00PWEN2ZE,David Tipping,5,"Tracfone has discontinued this phone, but it is still available from a few sellers. It does what I need and it's only $30."
B00PWEN2ZE,pat,1,El cheapo. It conked out several days after activation.
B00PWEN2ZE,Bobbi Smith,1,Bought this for my dad. It came and the speakers were blown. We tried to return it and Tracfone said we have to send it to them for replacement so I'm out the amount I paid for this. Not happy.
B00PWEN2ZE,West1,3,"Doesn't have a front camera and the one it does have takes poor, blurry photos. My daughter is disappointed, but there aren't many Tracfone options with the features she was hoping for."
B00PWEN2ZE,Velvetanne,5,So far I love it. I probably need to order the sim card for more storage and I don't really use many apps.
B00PWEN2ZE,Ernie,4,Good phone. Great wifi reception. But I am stumpedon how to find out how many minutes I have left. Does anyone know how to tell how keep track of minutes available on this phone????
B00PWEN2ZE,lorraine york,4,This has been a great little phone for calls and texts but 8gb is to small for running apps on a google phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Brad and Pam,5,"Easy order, easy to activate. Better price than TracFone direct. Fast shipping also. I am very pleased with this purchase."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"Nice display, good microphone. Once charged, very easy to set up with Tracfone service. Camera will not focuse - one star down. Easy access to the sim card and micro storage card."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pamela C.,4,"This phone is NOT SAFELINK COMPATABLE. It is clearly listed on the back of the box. I was disappointed because this phone is just the right size and the colors were vibrant and the phone is very easy to use. The reception is great and you can hear clearly. Besides the let down with safe link, this phone would be great!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Philip L.,5,This was a gift for my son. He loves it. Tracfone is a Best Buy at less than 8.00 a monthM
B00PWEN2ZE,guitarplayer130,5,"wow this has been a great phone. very durable, triples minutes, text, and data as well."
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert M.,5,Great price and quick delivery!
B00PWEN2ZE,A. Kozlowski,2,I bought this for my daughter's phone. Its such hard plastic that I can barely push the button in to turn it on and off. too stiff of plastic.
B00PWEN2ZE,dewane,5,"Great phone has service every where I at,and fast great all the way around."
B00PWEN2ZE,Zaid S.,3,"I'm gonna be honest - this is a good phone. But there's a few major issues.

First off, this phone is sold by Tracfone. This wouldn't be a problem, if it weren't for the fact that compared to other carriers, for most people Tracfone is more expensive, when they only have customers because of their 'bargains'. Not to mention, with Tracfone, you'll have storage issues. If you buy this phone as an unlocked phone, and then do the Bring Your Own Phone program (AKA the only confusing part of Tracfone), you'll have 8-16 GB of storage, but with Tracfone you'll get 2.75 GB of storage resulting in only about 950 MB of free storage, so you can only have one or two games. Also, I just want to mention that you should not buy this phone off the Tracfone website, for it's 80 bucks more there.

Then we have the camera. First off, let's talk about the front camera - Oh wait! There isn't one! This is a major issue for many smartphone buyers because for whatever reason people love to take 'selfies'. Not to mention video chat will be awful with this phone. And then there's the rear camera. This camera is a 5 MP and it's on the center, which isn't bad, but with this packaging, most of the time the camera is cracked, which you won't notice until you try to take a picture. I don't think I need to say any more about the camera.

Other than these issues, this overall is a good phone. There's a few minor issues like many Tracfone apps and the battery being unremovable, but I'd say it's not bad, in fact the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the right phone for me, and Tracfone is not the right carrier for me. Overall, if you don't take pictures often and don't play many games or do too much social media, and if you just want a quick phone to go online, call, and text, this phone is perfect for you. But just not for me."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,My son loves this new phone
B00PWEN2ZE,S. S. Isenberg,1,After activating phone the display contained vertical colored stripes. TracFone replaced it with an LG model that works much better.
B00PWEN2ZE,Doug,5,Probably be great if I was more into cell phones and tablets.
B00PWEN2ZE,Thomas Karneth,4,Nice phone - I really haven't had a chase to really explore it yet.
B00PWEN2ZE,Donna Van Derveer,3,"Didn't come as advertised, no USB cable was included as stated on the site."
B00PWEN2ZE,Maureen L.,5,Bought this for my husband who had a non-smartphone tracfone. He loves it and for the price its a nice little phone. He only uses for calls and he loves the google voice search....Very nice phone.....
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,"Does what I expected for a pay as you go phone with Tracfone. Not abundant features but knew that going in. Just needed a good reliable phone for occasional use and Motorola, now Google owned, is that phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Ann C. Ray,5,great phone for the price; completely satisfied
B00PWEN2ZE,Diana Lane,5,perfect first phone for my son!
B00PWEN2ZE,Jo Wall,3,"It is a nice phone IF you want to just use it as a phone or texting. However, I like to use it to check my e-mails and other web data. I have already used up all of that time in just the short time I have had it. Now I am stuck with a phone that I cannot do any more web searching. Does anyone have any recommendations for a phone similar to this with more web time?????"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,Phone was delivered used with a dead battery that won't charge stuck at 0%.... won't be buying again
B00PWEN2ZE,ComputerNerd,4,This is a good little smartphone that we use as a Tracfone. It is a good android experience. It does need at least 8 gigs of memory and 2 gigs of RAM.
B00PWEN2ZE,gtx,5,AMAZING MOBILE FOR THE PRICE -- GR8 PRICE / SERVICE / PRODUCT & SELLER -- GODSPEED & THX !!!
B00PWEN2ZE,libroreader,3,"More hi-tech than my old LG which it replaced. However, I am missing some nice features of my trusty LG. For one, the battery of the Moto E lasts only 2 days max, if not used. Another is the Unread Alarm for text messages: I can't find this feature. Maybe I don't know how to set it up?"
B00PWEN2ZE,Mverovoy,4,Less SAR from phone and more megapixels on camera would make this phone great
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,Keeps shutting down stickying keeys takes long time to download and no front camera only back camera while your dialing numbers screen goes blank I want my money back it's a piece of crap I want my money back ASAP
B00PWEN2ZE,Rex,3,"Be very careful when purchasing minutes, MOST DO NOT TRIPLE on this phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Grannie B,4,I sent it back because I did not see the prepaid when I ordered it.
B00PWEN2ZE,adam garey,5,Works sweet thank you just an alert when it's Straight Talk not Tracfone would have been considerate of your seller.
B00PWEN2ZE,Charlie,5,"I mean not even close to even being a good phone, but amazing for the price."
B00PWEN2ZE,Michael A Galante,5,This phone amazes me daily. This phone has all my friends talking good things about it.

B00PWEN2ZE,GC14,5,Gave the Moto E to my Dad for his birthday. He really likes the phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,gary noblin,2,"many apps that connected with lesser phone,wont function at all on this
fm radio handy tho."
B00PWEN2ZE,Chase Redfield,3,I have bought 4 of these in the last year and the headphone jack has broken on it each and everytime. Also only has 2 gigabytes of storage space so you have to be sparing with your apps. Still a great starter phone for a kid or someone who doesn't need extra apps.
B00PWEN2ZE,Jdex,2,"I really liked it at first but now it is starting to act up.People are calling me from my contact list and telling me that they are getting calls at weird times from this #.
I may have to return it if it happens again."
B00PWEN2ZE,Olatokunbo Sahid,4,Advert not specific
B00PWEN2ZE,Donuts,3,Okay for the price.
B00PWEN2ZE,Barbie,1,Worst phone I ever owned!
B00PWEN2ZE,eskelvr,2,I think I may have gotten a lemon.

B00PWEN2ZE,Julie McElhaney,1,horrible waste of money ... the phone worked a week ... 8 phone calls later and at least three hours wasted of my life trying to get a replacement ... complete bulls*** .. don't waste your money
B00PWEN2ZE,Cowboy,5,Love the phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Bob,1,"The phone thinks the head phones are on all the time . On phone calls they can hear me but unless I use headphones I can not hear them.
Works great in the car because it uses Bluetooth."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,I like the phone. Using it.

B00PWEN2ZE,MK,5,ty
B00PWEN2ZE,Jason Jenson,5,My son loves the phone. Works like a Motorola is supposed to!
B00PWEN2ZE,flavio,2,Not a storage worth cell bad pics and sound issues.
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert Porter,2,Have been unable to activate phone for anything other than emergency calls.
B00PWEN2ZE,guy,4,"Work great, had no problem with it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Donald Shamash,3,Took excessive time to setup with Tracfone. Confusing at times. Heavy accents from off-shore reps difficult to communicate with.
B00PWEN2ZE,Katie Hacker,3,Its O.K
B00PWEN2ZE,Paul M.,5,Love this phone great price
B00PWEN2ZE,Frank Carter,3,the Samsung OEM 2 amp adapter with 5 ' micro usb does not work. It isn't worth chasing guarantee.
B00PWEN2ZE,Sam Fox,1,"Cheaply made, I have a Motorola Moto and doesn't fit my phone at all. Way to big."
B00PWEN2ZE,Colleen,5,Awesome phone at a great value !

B00PWEN2ZE,neal byrd,2,Can't make calls. has a Verizon sim but was told it was trackphon
B00PWEN2ZE,Susan Mahaffie,5,Great phone!
B00PWEN2ZE,TrumpetCornet,4,"Still getting used to it, lots to learn since this is my first Android phone, but it has all and more that I need in a phone. True, the camera could be a nicer one, but then you can simply pay more and get a different phone with those features if you need them, but this is what I could get and still stay with Tracfone."
B00PWEN2ZE,ANN PULEO,5,It far exceeded my expectations
B00PWEN2ZE,dmcamp,5,Great android Tracfone
B00PWEN2ZE,Ed,4,Good but not great.
B00PWEN2ZE,Vilas,5,Nice phone. Bought it on sale. Excellent for $40. Gives triple minutes.
B00PWEN2ZE,Ronald G. Villata,4,"It's a nice tracfone. For 20 bucks, can't go wrong. No problems at all with phone. Transferring mins, data,text, and end of service, via online went with out a hitch. I transferred from old smartphone to this phone. The whole process took about 30 mins. Didn't has to call tracfone CS.
The camera is OK. Maybe a 3 star for camera. I loaded on the phone a photo resize app, to send photos via email."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pedro Acosta,4,It was what I expected
B00PWEN2ZE,JMN1234,3,Just an o.k. cell phone
B00PWEN2ZE,jh,4,I like the triple minutes
B00PWEN2ZE,Chris,5,1st smart phone purchase. Great battery life between charges for what I use it for. Love it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Gene McLean,5,An excellent buy - works perfecfly!
B00PWEN2ZE,rich miler,5,Can't beat the price .
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,"This phone never worked from the beginning. Don't think I will ever have another TracFone. Sometimes there is a signal and sometimes not. You drop calls ,It changes pages it will not turn off for ever."
B00PWEN2ZE,JM,2,"This phone was ok the first day that I had it, but then it started to turn on and off. I did a hard reset on it, and things went back to normal, but 2 days later it started to switch on and off again, and this time it didn't let me do any sort of reset, but it's one of the cheapest phones you can get on here so I guess I should expect too much."
B00PWEN2ZE,karen gallati,4,"So far, so good! There is a lot to learn though!"
B00PWEN2ZE,flash,5,Perfect
B00PWEN2ZE,RODNEY NATHANIEL,5,Satisfied.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kimberly,2,If you just need a phone for calls this is the phone for you. If you want to download any apps seek another phone. The memory sucks. These thing only has 3G. I will be returning.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,I am happy with the product
B00PWEN2ZE,jess barnes,4,Very good
B00PWEN2ZE,Dom Santos,1,"This Motrola Moto-E may very well be the worst value in cell phones, This is my SECOND Moto-E in less than a year and BOTH lost the rringtone feature after 60-90 days of usage. THERE IS NO FIX! A phone that does NOT ring is useless! Never again."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,2,Documentation was inadequate.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,My first smart phone way more than I need
B00PWEN2ZE,Robert Mireles II,4,"my first smart phone, love it, excellent price"
B00PWEN2ZE,A. Carpenter,4,"Nice phone, but no flash on camera, and battery is not replaceable. What company would market what is basically a throw away phone? Will probably use until it dies, but would not buy again."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,2,A little too difficult for me!!
B00PWEN2ZE,A. Yarrington,4,"Initial impressions of it are great. I docked 1 star b/c I feel I have to wait out a while to see if I wind up with the same reported speaker problem as other reviewers. So far, it's head and tails more responsive than the Samsung Galaxy Centura it replaces, which has a horrible lag when trying to use the phone feature."
B00PWEN2ZE,Ali,1,I Can't put my Sim car
B00PWEN2ZE,mama bear,3,Even with an SD card and 5 small apps added it's always saying that the memory is running out. Also it won't let me delete the factory apps that I never use
B00PWEN2ZE,Chaya N.,3,"OK product, great with Tracfone.

Negatives:

1. Battery life STINKS! I'm charging it every 3 days, and I use it almost never, just keep it sleeping but on to receive texts.
2. More of a complaint about smartphone, I suppose rather than the Moto E, but I don't like that I can't display the number of service days left and minutes left on the opening screen. Instead, I have to open the app and wait for the information to refresh.
3. I find it tiresome that in order to turn off the phone completely I have to hold down the power button, then touch for ""power off,"" then touch ANOTHER button to confirm that I'm shutting it off. I know: first world problems, right?"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,5,Excelent!
B00PWEN2ZE,leey,5,Nice phone
B00PWEN2ZE,tom,5,"phone is fine, works as a smart phone should."
B00PWEN2ZE,Zebra3,2,"Hmmm not very good so I return it back it is actually not cheap to buy all those time and data,text cards so I'll pass cause it just ain't convenient for me to be buying those all the time. This phone won't even activate even if your outside then when you go online to do it then you will have to buy a phone card right away."
B00PWEN2ZE,Richard Cesena,4,"So far, I love the phone. But what do I know? My niece hasn't shown me how to make it work yet. However, judging by other reviews, it sounds ike just what I need. I like the triple minutes feature. BUT!!!...., my other Tracfones displayed how many minutes were left, on the face. From what I've read this phone does not (come to think of it, make that a four star rating). In order to see how much time is left, you either have to download an app, or log on to the Trackfone Moto E site. That's a BIG NEGATIVE, as far as I'm concerned.
Why did they do that? Oh, yeah, so they can sell you another app. That'll eat up them triple minutes!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Lucidstar,4,Not the size expected. I bought it as a gift for my mom and wanted something bigger.
B00PWEN2ZE,BonQuiQui,3,"*fastest and largest screen you can get on tracfone for under $50

but....

*doesn't take good photos

*awkward OS configuration, not intuitive at all"
B00PWEN2ZE,muggsie,5,i can only say positives about this phone! It is the best deal out there'
B00PWEN2ZE,Carletta Johnson,1,Stop working. Phone won't turn on . Haven't used the phone 3 times.
B00PWEN2ZE,David A.,3,"Smart phone for a dummy user. NOT the best combination. Rather complicated, especially for an older person."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jason N Webb,1,"I bought this phone it looks great but ""will not work in my area"" I really feel that Amazon should not have sold this to a zip code in which the phone will not work. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
B00PWEN2ZE,sahararose,1,"I have never had an issue with Tracfone or Motorola before. In fact, my very first cellphone was a Motorola and I adored it. I do not adore this however. It is impossible to activate it from the Tracfone website; therefore it is less than useless to me. I was really looking forward to using it too. I will just keep using the old ones until they run out and can't be upgraded anymore."
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,1,i got this phone for the triple minutes and transfered my phone number to it and have a hard time with settings and trying to log onto internet is impossible
B00PWEN2ZE,patricia bourget,1,waste of time and money it died after 1 day
B00PWEN2ZE,mixup,4,"Phone is great, but I wish the camera had a zoom lens."
B00PWEN2ZE,renee nguyen,2,Bad battery got to send it back
B00PWEN2ZE,George,3,"I wouldn't buy it again, as it is one step up from a flip phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Susan,4,The phone is very nice but the battery is awful. It only holds charge for 1 day. Need a better battery.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kindle Customer,3,still getting to know it - I am positive I will love it once I am fully enmeshed in it
B00PWEN2ZE,Rebel Smith,5,As described
B00PWEN2ZE,suecitysue,1,"I purchased this phone for my daughter's 20th birthday. We were going through a REAL family emergency; when we found the cell phone in its box, it was DEAD, have tried to charge it, etc. to no avail and no return, NOT Happy... (My mother in law was extremely ill, went to the hospital, nursing home (so we had to plan and prepay her funeral) and she died August 15, 2016. We just buried her remains Saturday, August. 27, 2016. Our vehicle was also hit and run the day my mother in law was sent to the nursing home, I found a potentially cancerous lump, and my daughter started a new job ALL in that six weeks, with us trying to comfort my mother in law, deal with work, plan a funeral, clean out my mother-in-laws apartment. IF we were able to use it, I would not expect an exchange/refund. Are there even any suggestions on how to repair the phone or just run it over?"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,3,too bad I'm not smart enough to use a smart phone for the money you can't beat it
B00PWEN2ZE,Joe,3,"I loved the phone at first, but the ear piece speaker quit working a little more than a month after I bought it. I have gone round and round with TracFone and still has to send me a prepaid mailing kit so I may send this defective phone back and have it replaced, in short, I have used TracFone for quite a few years and I must say that I am highly disappointed by their customer service people, they suck!!!!!! I am upset that this new phone is junk a little over a month into ownership. I specifically purchased a Motorola product as they have been around for a long time and generally have good reliability. I am just about ready to DUMP Tracfone and get a contract phone plan. Customer service did not care that I have a terminal cancer and that I cannot be without a phone, they actually hung up on me twice while I was trying to get the phone replaced and they still have done nothing more than send me a sim card so I can temporarily reactivate my old phone until the exchange is made. I like the idea of the contract and a new phone every couple of years and probably a lot less B.S. with customer service due to the fact that they too are bound by the contract as well. Beware of the prepaid folks, and also this phone will eat you alive if the data is turned on as opposed to just upload and downloads in WIFI zones only which is free. Also I found a dual layer case at I-BLASON,com for around 20 bucks as opposed to the 40 to 50 range I first looked at. This was an excellent buy, great quality product."

B00PWEN2ZE,Rose,1,"Although I have purchased and used the Androids (by Samsung) in the past, with no complaints...this Moto-E was not comparable nor acceptable. After a few months, I began have tech problems which never occurred before, and altho I purchased TRIPLE minutes, texts, etc, it suddenly quit ringing, due to ""no space"" left. I had not changed any apps, and tried deleting/uninstalling unused apps, which made NO difference. It kept notifying me that my ""space"" was gone, so it became useless, and all my photos/gallery suddenly disappeared and was unavailable to me. (no camera use)

NOW, it won't charge at all (less than one year usage) and is no good to me. I'm assuming the (crappy) battery, which is said to be irreplaceable, is done, and of course I won't replace this MOTO phone anyway. Back to Samsung, which I can depend on, with my annual Tracfone service plan.

By the way, this phone has had very little usage, since I only use it on occasion when we travel or when I'm away from home."

This is the first that ever just rolled over and died on its own. I've treated it pretty nice, but it's keyboard was kinda goofy. I pretty much made all calls with the voice command option: which worked well.

Motorola is always a good durable product and, I think, a good value; I have three other Motorola phones in the drawer (pre-smart phones)
I'm though on phones. Loose 'em, smash 'em, drown 'em Take off and leave them at home or somewhere. the kids have even appropriated them.
I buy a prepaid card and a phone and the Motorolas last better: often they get a second or third prepaid top off.

I'm pretty busy till the 1st of the year: I'll get by with a cheap LG: the phone and voice dial work well; the Smart doesn't. Then I think I'll get and Motorola E 2nd generation. I don't think I'll buy another refurb for awhile"

B00PWEN2ZE,Ken Enzinna,2,"My wife and I are extremely disappointed. Bought the phone through Tracfone and had more problems getting our minutes transferred over. Lost everything on the phone and was without a phone for 5 days because no one at Tracfone could figure out what where my minutes and data went. Downloads disappear and account does not track properly. Battery runs down within hours. Because the phone is locked, can't switch to another company. Not friendly user. Right now, all we can do is text and make calls. This is the first time we have ever had problems with Tracfone as we have used this company for a few years. Wish I could trade these phones in or get our money back."
B00PWEN2ZE,LJS,1,"False Advertisement, Tracfone advertises rollover minutes that never run out as long you are actively calling within 6 months. Do not believe this lie I bought minutes one month ago and only use the phone for emergencies. When my wife tried to use the phone is said it was deactivated. I talked with customer service and they said I have to buy more minutes because my service time was up. What! Thes never tell you that until you run into this issue I will never use Tracfone again. This the old bait and switch. There is no roll over or triple minutes."

I wanted a bigger screen with room for more icons and I got the same room as the smaller screen! I hate the google search bar!!!! It just opens Chrome but it opens a new page and does not bring your last pages. They could have locked on on the home page and left you with the room on the rest of the pages... BUT NNNOOOOO!!!!!

B00PWEN2ZE,AM,1,"I bought this cellphone, to save money on calls made in wifi, but nooooo, my minutes were going fast as I keep checking the balance with the tracfone widget, even calls to tracfone costumer service to fix my issue were not free eigther."
B00PWEN2ZE,geekacres,4,"Tracfone's Android offerings continue to get better each year. This Moto E, at less than fifty dollars, really provides some great bang for your buck, while allowing the user to control their bill via Tracfone. The Moto E has some nice heft to it and is made of solid materials including its Gorilla Glass screen. The screen is bright, the call quality clear, and the wifi range is decent. The Moto E runs Kit Kat out of the box and feels pretty snappy for a phone of this price-point. Its also worth mentioning that this phone, and every Android Trac, gets triple values in each bucket. So when you add a 200 ""unit"" card, you get 600 minutes of call time, 600 texts, and 600 megs of data. And, if you find yourself burning data faster than calling and texting, you can buy data-only cards, though those do not triple.

I also like the fact that you can add a micro SD card to expand your memory for pictures, music, and to shift many apps from the phone's meager memory space. I picked up a 16 gig card here at Amazon, but the phone will accommodate up to 32gb.

Downsides include the somewhat mushy power button and volume rocker, plus the complete lack of any kind of front facing camera. Selfie and Skype addicts, beware. The primary camera is also not the greatest, but its serviceable and does just fine in well lit, outdoor scenarios. The first gen Moto E may not a cutting edge offering, but there's a lot to like in this entry level Android."
B00PWEN2ZE,trlamb,5,"My Tracfone Moto E (Motorola XT830C) came with Android 4.4.4 preinstalled, and it is a huge step up from my 3-year-old LG800g. When I researched phones, I simply wanted a phone that:
-- is small enough for my jeans pocket and fairly light to hold,
-- has great call quality,
-- has a camera for emergency use,
-- has a responsive, easy-to-use, easy-to-read touchscreen,
-- has GPS and bluetooth,
-- can use my home wifi for downloading maps,
-- can use my Google Contacts, Google Calendar and Evernote,
-- is inexpensive but well-built,
-- uses Android, and
-- will work with my existing Tracfone (CDMA) plan, which I have had for nearly 10 years.

Moto E met my criteria. My only surprise has been that Tracfone changed my service provider from AT&T to Verizon, which meant I had to re-enroll for several banking alerts. Other than that, it has been great! It is so nice to get Google Calendar and Google Contacts on my phone.

I used Tracfone's 800 number to transfer my number to my new phone, instead of the Internet. Then, while I waited for the Tracfone service to forward from my old phone, I connected the Moto E to my home wifi and logged into my gmail account. Soon, all my apps were downloaded and ready to use. There was way less bloatware than the Samsung tablets have had. I popped the back cover off and installed a 16GB micro SD card (14.78 usable space). Unfortunately, Android 4.4.4 does not let apps write much to an SD card, so it will only be good for photos, music, books and maps.

The power and volume buttons seemed hard to push, but I have learned to press harder. The phone is not as light (5.0 oz) as I would have liked, but it is one of the smallest smartphones and it works with Tracfone. On my home wifi, it is as responsive as my desktop and Samsung Galaxy S 8.4 tablet. I have not tried the mobile data yet because I have it turned off. The phone paired easily with my two cars, two tablets, keyboard and headset.

The screen is remarkably easy to read, and the touchscreen is delightful to use. In fact, I won't add a screen protector because I don't want to change the responsiveness.

Be sure to look for a QR reader app that will work without autofocus. And download the Tracfone app, so you can see your remaining balances and expiration date!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Yoko Nakase,2,"I was looking for using sim. not take my sim, so I returned it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Dfw1407,5,I love it!
B00PWEN2ZE,Crysta Franklin,1,The description never mentioned it not having a front facing camera. I didn't realise this until I was going to take a selfie and it wouldn't turn the camera around. I don't like this and I'll have to return it as soon as possible. I can't video chat anyone until I order a new phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,superbrain,4,"Love this phone. Feels solid with great features for the price. Plus, the Motorola cases for the Moto E don't increase the thickness much as the back pops off and is replaced by the case. Nice bright screen, Gorilla Glass, streams Netflix wonderfully when on WiFii, decent sound, etc. I own a Droid Turbo and, obviously, the Moto E is nowhere near as nice but it really is a great phone. Because it's a Motorola, the Android experience (Version 4.4.4 as of 12/26/14) is much like the Droid Turbo and other Motorola Android phones I've owned. Smooth and non-cluttered.

This is a gift for a loved one and replaces an older feature phone (LG840G) from Tracfone. The experience I've had trying to transfer the number from the old phone from the new one is the reason I am giving this Tracfone 4 instead of 5 stars. The problem is that transferring the number from the old phone, which used ATT for service, to the new phone, which uses Verizon, has taken over 2 days thus far. Calls to Tracfone customer service, routed to a non-US location, have been frustrating and useless. I do understand that it must take some time for this to happen. I don't understand why it is taking THIS long. The process has resulted in my loved one (and me) being frustrated rather than excited about the new phone and, given that I'll be leaving in a few hours, they will be left to have to deal with ensuring the phone is eventually activated.. Not a huge deal, but frustrating nonetheless. However, the phone itself truly is impressive, particularly for the cost, and I assume the service will be great if the phone ever is activated.. I'll update to let you know how long it takes."

B00PWEN2ZE,Sandee H.,2,"Phone is a decent quality and works well. Giving only 2-stars because the title and description of this product are very misleading. It states that the phone comes with ""Triple Minutes."" It does not come with any minutes at all. I guess it's technically true that triple of zero minutes is still zero, but it's still misleading and pretty shady."
B00PWEN2ZE,LMJ,1,"Had to return this as the battery failed -might be a fluke but since it was ""sold as new"" was disappointed. Also be advised that battery is not easily replaceable unless you have the phone serviced-cost less to buy a new phone which I'm sure is what they want. Bought an unlocked BLU instead with replaceable battery, 2 sim slots PC connection and better value. Since sim cards are so cheap these days, an unlocked phone is a far better value if you use pay as you go plans like Tracfone."
B00PWEN2ZE,Norman Morrison,5,"Moving up the Tracfone phone food chain this is where we are today. Phone #3 or so. The first real smart phone. We have had this phone (two of them) for a year and a half at least. I have never understood how folks were so willing to spend all that money for a big name cell phone, except for a toy.

Since we have had one for so long I'm confident to tell you that if you don't demand the best toys, and highest talk charges this thing is for you. Especially using it in conjunction with WhatsApp, a hundred bucks a year on top of this $19.95 phone gets you plenty of uptime.

Now. Here's the deal. As you know a smartphone is basically a handheld computer with a phone app. The Moto E phone app works as well as any you'll get on the most expensive phones. Sometimes better. It really pulls in the signal. The phone software has all the geegaws you demand to soup up your experience as much as you like. Standard Android stuff.

As a computer. Well, I'm sure the big boy phones work better. The Moto E is not blessed with a whole lot of onboard memory, and the stuff that comes with it, Google, etc. can't be moved to the SD card you'll purchase separately. This means you can only put your very favorite apps on there. You can't junk it up. Still..I have quite a several programs that I like. For normal people, you will have space.

I have never had a problem surfing. For that... it is fine. Fine as rain. And the display is great. GREAT display.

But...I have had crashes with some other programs. This phone is *almost* powerful enough to go mainline big time. It also gets kinda warm with intense computing and the battery goes down pretty quick. So, if it's a computer you favor most, I'd recommend the higher end Tracfone or one of those other companies where you pay 10X to get to play Asteroids and Apesnargles. The phone does work pretty well for a map app, btw, but you'll have to keep it plugged into the charger.

The camera: My last brain dead phone camera took better photos, I think. The photos are OK..but probably not as good as some other phones might give you. If you don't have much of a picture connoisseur about you, don't worry about it. It's good enough. Since it has only a rear facing camera, you'll have to video chat using a mirror. If you haven't used the newer photo tools available with this thing you'll have all the fun.

My assessment is that for the price you could spend five times more and get the same or less. This thing is the king of the cheap phones. You'll be spending 10X-20X more to get significantly better performance.

So, if you need a good phone that will do everything the big boys will do...and one you'll be proud to show your friends...this is it. Unless your pals are geeks they won't know the difference. Get it and be proud. Save a thousand bucks a year.

PS: I'm going to try to add a recent snap for you to see. Note that the trees are just a little indistinct. Just a tad. With such a tiny camera to work with I don't know how much better the big boy phones will do. So, you be the judge. The video function works fine. Hey. I like it."
B00PWEN2ZE,roger lee,2,had problems with phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Rhea Phillips,1,Does not come pre loaded with minutes. You have to buy a plan which defeats the purpose of a go phone. Also there's no customer service support. The number you call is electronic support and it is worthless.
B00PWEN2ZE,Angela Cosner,1,could not get access where i live so they would not activate it si i sent it back
B00PWEN2ZE,Carl Nys,1,I had to return defective phone
B00PWEN2ZE,cm,4,"I bought this phone through Tracfone two weeks ago for $129 and it's $89 here.

It's a pretty good phone and IMHO, the best one Tracfone is offering. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy Centura through Tracfone and it has a mind of its own. It starts programs on its own and actually started sequentially-dialing my ""contacts"" when it was in my pocket.

The Motorola e seems to be a very stable phone due to its more-current Operating System (Android ""Kit Kat""). The camera is a little goofy. To take a picture, you touch any place on the image screen vs. a ""button"" . The camera doesn't have a flash or zoom options although all phone cameras are ""digital zoom"" which can be done with a photo editor anyway.

It does not have a replaceable battery like many phones do. The battery is encased in the plastic shell. It may be accessible if you're a ""hardware type"" by removing several small screws although the phone runs risk of being damaged in doing so. I also believe it may be difficult to find the battery. However, for $89.00, one could buy another phone but I suspect by time the battery goes, one would want a newer/more-current phone anyway.

Make sure to get a micro SD card when you purchase it (I got a 32 GB one).

Motorola has an excellent migration software tool called ""Motorola Migrate"". You load it on your old phone from Google Play and it downloads all of your contacts, WiFi configurations, videos and pictures over wireless WiFi. It also initiates an automatic download of Apps that are on your ""old phone"" with some exceptions. I found that it skipped a few apps (Waze and my weather app) and I had to manually load them via Play Store.

I love the phone. It's reasonable, reliable and with Tracfone, you get 3X talk, data and texts for the life of the phone. Also note that Tracfone uses Verizon's network for CDMA phones (like this one) so you'll get a reliable network with it."
B00PWEN2ZE,pamsaunt,5,"Doesn't Even SAY It's a Tracfone!
No goofy TF logo or TF sound, but all the benefits of user controlled minutes and data at very reasonable prices, especially for those who use 200 minute/month or less. Kids must love it cause their friends don't know it's a TracFone. I love it because it is easy to use, does tons of things, and hasn't cost any more than the initial $109 I paid for it and the 400-minute/text/MB data card, which tripled to 1200. I've now had it for 5 months and couldn't be happier for all the reasons that many others have already mentioned. It replaced a maddeningly UNsmart ZTE Valet. The camera is just so-so, but OK for snapshots. The screen is quite clear and easy to read-except in sunshine. Sorry that a few folks have had problems, but that seems to happen in all brands."
B00PWEN2ZE,A Reader,1,"won't let you use mms without a wifi connection.sucks!was going to get one for the wife,no way..."
B00PWEN2ZE,Hargreaves,1,"This phone worked fine given its limitatons for six months. Then suddenly it went into AIRPORT MODE {No, I didn't accidentally
hit Airplane Mode} and it got stuck in that option. That locks out all use of the Internet. I took it to a phone tech and we tried everything to take it out of Airplane Mode.
Apparently this is a common failing of this phone (and others?). Last resort we tried wiping the phone but all that did was wipe
the text but not shift the Airplane Mode. I gave up on it, bit the bullet and bought a Galaxy SkyJ3 TracFone. More money but it
also has a removable battery and SIM card in back. The Moto E has a metal plate preventing you from removing the battery and SIM card which I wanted to do as an attempt to get it out of Airplane Mode.

So, if you buy this MotoE, or have one, do NOT ever put it into Airplane Mode. You may not get out. Keep in mind that I did not put it into Airplane Mode. It slipped into it all on its own. :-("
B00PWEN2ZE,JB,5,"I've upgraded from the ZTE Valet, and I can easily say that the Moto E is FAR better! Where the Valet had all the capabilities of a smartphone, it was just a constant pain to use. If you're on the fence about this, yeah, get the Moto E. My only complaint is the low storage (4 GB). So I would definitely recommend getting an SD Card. Also, I got a killer deal from shopcelldeals on eBay. I got the Moto E and a year of service (w/1200 minutes) for $100. (You may have to hunt around for a good deal from them because they change them a lot and they have multiple offers for the same phone.) The switchover from the Valet to the Moto E was really easy on Tracfone.

Later-> I ran out of space! I put about 1.5 GB of music and some apps on the phone and that's it. I have a 16 GB SD Card on the way, though. But 4 GBs on the phone??? I suppose Motorola wants the Moto E to be seen as an entry-level phone and steer people towards a more expensive one.

I'm still very impressed with the phone (despite the small storage). It even works as a good eBook reader. And I actually want to use it (in contrast to the ZTE Valet, where I only used it when really needed).

The phone's cable also will not break into a cable for connecting to a computer (another cheap move by Motorola). It is only for recharging the battery. You can buy a separate MicroUSB-to-USB cable, however. Or use a wireless app (such as AirDroid) to move files from a PC to the phone."
B00PWEN2ZE,S. Miklas,5,"I am relatively new to tracfone - so I bought this as a replacement for the LG dynamic (which is an ""OK"" starter phone - just not a lot of memory and an old android version...) I LOVE this phone. I bought this because I wanted more space to download apps and wanted a phone with a bigger screen. It feels nice in your hand - good weight, sturdy build... this is not a cheap looking or feeling phone. Good sound quality, reception and wifi signal. I love that it has an FM radio in it! I am also impressed by the camera - takes pretty nice pictures. It probably isn't as fancy as some other phones out there, but for tracfone, this has to be one of the better phones to get if on a budget. Price was excellent too! Bought this on sale for $39.99 and I am not regretting it. Transferring my old phone literally was instant. Impressed all the way around."
B00PWEN2ZE,HawgRyder,5,I've been using Tracfone and its phones for many years. I'm always in search of a better phone. If they offered and iPhone id pony up and pay for the thing but they don't. Prior to purchasing this phone i had the ZTE Valet which at the time was one of the best if you want to call it a smart phone phone they offered. Thats all i can say it in comparison to the Moto E is a dumb slow rendition of a smart phone. The only thing this phone is missing is a forward facing camera which i'd been willing to pay extra for if they offered it. This phone is the perfect size. It's blazing fast and for the money i don't think it can be beat. Gorilla glass is what every touch phone should have on it. I'll keep looking for a higher performance phone but right now this is in my opinion the best Tracfone phone they have to offer. I mean it comes from Motorola which is like the king of wireless information devices.
B00PWEN2ZE,Christopher J. Mcgrath,4,"The phone itself is worth 5 stars. Amazing for the price, especially if you buy with 1200 minutes package, which makes the phone basically free. But: It is a Tracfone. Simply transferring number from old Tracfone to this took a day and a couple of call to support to work out issues. Also, Tracfone Promo codes don't apply to Android devices. I also read if you are a heavy texter non-Android Tracfone's get you more texts for the buck.
In spite of the drawbacks it's worth it for people who don't want an expensive cell plan but want a full featured Android phone (including GPS). I have a Moto G and this is as good in most respects, but the lack of front camera and rear camera flash may be show stoppers for some. The screen is bright and clear. An inexpensive 32G micro SD card will allow the installation of all the apps, music, podcasts and photos that most could ever want. I bought one for my wife and she loves it so far. Maybe not the best choice for low tech folks (they may find moving apps, music and photos the to micro SD card challenging) but if you are familiar at all with Android OS you should be fine with it."
B00PWEN2ZE,Siobhan,1,DO NOT GET. ITS HORRIBLE
B00PWEN2ZE,nothinfornothin,4,"Like other reviewers have stated. The phone's internal storage is very limited. The installed apps that come installed on the phone. You cannot uninstall them. 50 percent or so of your internal storage is taken up by the installed apps. I tried installing some and I could only install 3 of my own.. If the internal storage does not concern you though. It's really a great phone. I really like it. It takes nice pictures, I like the screen resolution, and I've never had any calls dropped. It's very reliable."
B00PWEN2ZE,Pat,3,I like the phone but there is no space on the internal memory to add more than 1 app.or 2 small ones. Of the other apps I tried I was only able to move one to the sd card. I was not able to remove any of the apps that came on the phone and used most of the 2.21gb hard drive. I currently have 1 app on and when google play and other apps that came with it try to update I get message to remove the one app as there is no space to install updates.
B00PWEN2ZE,steven glikbarg,4,"I bought this phone through Tracfone two weeks ago for $129 and it's $89 here.

It's a pretty good phone and IMHO, the best one Tracfone is offering. I previously had a Samsung Galaxy Centura through Tracfone and it has a mind of its own. It starts programs on its own and actually started sequentially-dialing my ""contacts"" when it was in my pocket.

The Motorola e seems to be a very stable phone due to its more-current Operating System (Android ""Kit Kat""). The camera is a little goofy. To take a picture, you touch any place on the image screen vs. a ""button"" . The camera doesn't have a flash or zoom options although all phone cameras are ""digital zoom"" which can be done with a photo editor anyway.

It does not have a replaceable battery like many phones do. The battery is encased in the plastic shell. It may be accessible if you're a ""hardware type"" by removing several small screws although the phone runs risk of being damaged in doing so. I also believe it may be difficult to find ...

B00PWEN2ZE,J. Perkins,5,"Love this phone! In my opinion there are only two real choices for tracfone smartfones. The moto e and the lg optimus fuel. The moto e is much better size being 4.3"" rather then 3.5"". The one draw back is not having a flash or auto focus on camera. Not a big deal but annoying none the less. I have owned 4 tracfone smartphones within the last year one being the zte valet(absolute garbage!). The moto e is one phone i will stick with for awhile. Please not the moto e was not listed on the tracfone website with the phones for my zip. I found out that it should work though anyway so i went for it. I had no issues what so ever activating my moto e."
B00PWEN2ZE,Jennifer J. Powell,5,I absolutely love my Moto E! I have had it for almost a year and have not found anything that I cannot do with it. It is with me pretty much 24/7 when I'm out and using data instead of being on Wi-Fi I don't go through nearly as much as my kids do with their iPhones! I only wish the onboard memory was better. I have a micro SD in it.
B00PWEN2ZE,cas,5,"Nicest phone I ever owned. Nice size and very easy to use. The newer ones are like carrying a small screen tv.
It does what a cell phone should do, it is a phone. Tracfone is Great."
B00PWEN2ZE,Soon Young Kim,1,"Tracfone has THE WORST customer service. We were trying to add on new air time minutes using a recently purchased 200 minute card with a previous pre-paid phone. I called the customer service line on the back of the phone, reactivated the phone as instructed and entered in the Airtime PIN. The phone was still not working, so I called again, this time to speak with customer service directly. I ended up getting the most obnoxious and rude customer service rep I have ever run across. This guy was blaming me for trying to put on minutes on an older phone and said the minutes were added onto someone else's pre-paid phone. He said it was non-refundable! Unbelievably, the guy actually gave me the name of the owner of the OTHER phone! For the next hour, he repeatedly put us on hold saying he had to run it by with his supervisor. When I asked to speak to his supervisor? He literally hung up on me. I called right afterwards, and I got an automated message saying that customer service was closed after midnight, even though it was by then 11:45 pm. Unbelievable. Do NOT use Tracfone for your pre-paid phone service. It is totally not worth it."
B00PWEN2ZE,auntpitty,5,"I just purchased the Moto and it puts any Apple phone to shame. It has a battery that lasts at least a day and a half. Not like an Apple, that their owners have to find a plug to keep it charged as soon as soon as they get anywhere! It has a good heff to it which means to me, it is made well. Great wi-fi which gets speed readings of 30 mb down and 6 mb up. The display is awsome with brightness again that puts the Apple to shame. All the apps load instantly and the screen is like lightning. To make it even better, I only paid $19.95 from Wall Mart. Sorry, they are sold out!!! All the complainers on this site must be unhappy Apple owners that know they really got took buying an Apple instead of a Motorola. Apple is all HYPE while the underdog, Motorola, has to PUT OUT!!!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Rob,5,Even if you add no apps you will run out of space. It has only 4GB internal memory. Even if you add a MicroSD card for apps it will still give you errors because by default it wants to put apps on the phone. I replaced this phone with a more powerful phone but this stays in my emergency bag for emergency 911 calls which you can use on any phone even if its deactivated. Depending on your personal use you will love it or upgrade.

B00PWEN2ZE,S.,2,"The Moto E is one of worst smartphones that we have ever owned, out of the 6 smartphones that we've owned. My wife bought this phone less than a year ago, and the entire experience has been very frustrating.

Phone crashes frequently. Only has enough internal memory to hold 1-3 apps. Default apps like Gmail and Google Plus are constantly growing in size, which means you need to uninstall an app or two just to receive updates to system apps. Nearly all internal memory is consumed by the OS, leaving almost nothing for 3rd party apps.

While the phone supports an external SD card, very few apps will allow themselves to be installed on the SD card and the SD card is mostly unused."
B00PWEN2ZE,New Orleanian,3,"As far as I'm concerned the MOST VALUABLE user review rating is from the one who's had the phone for the longest time, and that'll be me, right here, right now, as I make this review. After all.... everyone can say a phone is great, right out of the box, right? It's NEW, so it should be great. BUT....how about over time?? How about as time marches on??

Well, I've now owned this Motorola Moto E phone for 1 year. Here's what I can tell the reader about it:

âºâº The 3 NEGATIVES you NEED to know about:

#1.) The EAR volume, (held up to the ear), while NOT on speaker phone, is too soft & too low, even on the highest setting. In noisy airports, or with the TV going at home, I can't hear the person on the other line, with the phone right up to my ear.

#2.) As for the volume on the speaker phone, I have had it CUT-OUT and short circuit from time to time, to the point where it just does not function at all, like a loose short in it. I have to keep tapping it and tapping it in different spots and hope the speaker volume comes back to life & turns ON again. I've been able to revive it, each time. This has happened several times to me, over 10-12 times during the past 1 year.

#3.) And this negative, is a HUGE blow to those who are wanting to run all kinds of APPS. There is NOT enough internal memory storage space on this phone. Only 4 GB is a horribly low number in today's modern times, in the year 2017 as I write this. All kinds of APPS want to download updates, and new apps require NEW storage space, and there just isn't enough resources all the way around to install all these updates & apps to function.

âºâº The POSITIVES:

I've been able to store and load my own custom ring tones and my own custom notifications sounds on to this phone. Additionally, I can load up all my MP3 music files to this phone, no problem either.

It has a flashing light that'll blink if you had a phone call, text message, or voice mail, so that's a nice touch, without even having to wake it up from a sleep.

You can load-up your own personalized background skin or ""wallpaper"" to your phone, from any picture. The text messaging has a spell-correct auto function, so if it sees you're misspelling a word, it'll try & correct your typing. That's a nice feature.

The architectural framework installed on this phone is Android Operating System 4.4.4, Kit Kat. This is an obsolete operating system nowadays being several years old, but this is what you get for the much smaller amount of money you're paying for. Internet ""data rate"" is only 3G, if you have a data plan. I've gotten along by using Wi-Fi, without the purchase of a data plan, and that's been fine for me. In fact, I only am subscribed to text & talk only, unlimited. The talk by command function does not work functionally, and don't expect it to for the little money you pay.

If you are of the older generation, and looking to ""just get by"" with talking and texting, and don't have a need for pictures or video, nor data useage, nor the demand for lots of apps, either, then this phone will suit you well. Pictures are comparable to 1st generation digital cameras when they first came out. Pictures are NOT good in low-level lighting situations, either. If there's the slightest move of the camera, pictures will come out blurry.

However, if you are an intensive APP's-using person, that requires lots of apps to be downloaded & constantly used and you're heavy in to data usage, forget it. You'll need to SPEND the money and pay over $100 for a quality phone, as the speed & storage space on this phone will curtail your user demands, and you'll get very frustrated & disappointed with this phone in a quick hurry.

B00PWEN2ZE,Ginny L.,3,"I have had this phone for two years, and my only complaint is that I wish it had more internal memory. I can't have all of the aps I would like on this phone. Also the camera isn't so good. But otherwise, for calling and texting and wifi, it is great!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"I have been using this phone for the last month, I love it! Works great, a real smart phone! It doesn't have a camera flash nor does it have a front camera and it is only five megapixel. I have taken some very nice outside photos but inside they leave much to be desired!"
B00PWEN2ZE,Bekah,5,"This is my third tracfone, since I have had problems with the others. But I have not had ANY problems with this phone. Plus, it was a great price, I got mine for $50. If you are looking for a great tracfone, buy this one. You will NOT be disappointed!!! :)"
B00PWEN2ZE,Jill foster,1,arrived without any
B00PWEN2ZE,Hugh,3,"For the money it is good buy. Not a great buy though because if you want to run apps you will be frustrated at the lack of internal memory. I purchased a 32 gb sd card to solve the problem only to find out that it did little to help. TracFone has the os locked so that you can not swap the external memory with the internal by rooting the device. Thus you are stuck with the very small internal memory. This is compounded by the fact that all of the Google apps will only run using internal memory and many other apps also want a significant amount of internal memory. If TracFone would allow you to root the device and swap the internal for external memory the problem would be fixed.
Also the camera is only rear facing and while the pictures seemed to come out alright I could never tell if they were in focus or not."
B00PWEN2ZE,Smart shopper ohio,5,"I just bought the Moto E android phone, and I transferred minutes from my old tracfone ( not a smart phone ) to this new phone within an hour. I had 1200 minutes balance on my old tracfone. After I transferred all the minutes to this new phone, it turns to be 1200 minute for call, 1200 text messages and 1.2 G data base on the new phone just as being told on the Tracfone website. I do not have a problem like only certain amount minutes can be transferred."
B00PWEN2ZE,1stApotheosis,2,"I purchased two of these phones less than a year ago, and they both started recently having a number of issues. I had to do a factory reset on one of them, but weird things keep happening that require restarts. The other one is starting to have problems too. Some of the problems include screen blackouts, shutting down GPS unexpectedly, and app errors that we don't have on our Samsung. It's too bad because they worked really great for a few months."
B00PWEN2ZE,Aubrey J. Taylor,3,"First problem I had with this phone was no sound. Went through all the checks to no avail. Read on the internet speaker not working was a common problem. One solution was to remove back and strongly squeeze case beneath battery close to speaker. Weirdly enough this caused my speaker to work. Also on my phone the wifi pick up is very weak. I need to stay within 25 ft of the sending unit. My previous phone was an LG Fuel which other than the screen is a much better phone than the Moto E.. I do like the screen on the E, otherwise it is just OK."
B00PWEN2ZE,Missy,1,"The battery had a dent, its pretty but beware..."
B00PWEN2ZE,W. Chen,3,"I have not used the phone yet, so I stay neutral on the phone, but TRACFONE service has been crap so far.
I asked tracfone to port my phone number from another prepaid carrier three days ago, communication with the agent was long and painful. I had to state my name and address letter by letter, at least 2 to 3 times for each word, then it has to happen again. The agent had very very heavy accent and very very light memory. The reason that I had to do the porting/activation on phone was the online process was stuck at certain step.
Right after my call, my phone was disconnected from the old carrier. Now more than 85 hours and countless calls and hours talks with Tracfone CS, my phone is still not activated. I have been phone-less for 85 hours.
Think about it before you take the plunge. It is not about the phone, it is about the carrier.

Update-Day 5/Mar042015: Porting department promised me the phone will be entered to their system manually and it should not take more than 24 hours. That was yesterday. Today, my phone still could not be activated. I called the activation department, the tech department, the porting department and was kicked around. Eventually someone from some department told me that it will take ANOTHER 72 hours, I lost my heart and asked for a new number assigned to the phone.

So I lost my old phone number, my over 10 hours of time with , and gained lots of bad feelings.

Update/March12 2015: After one week with the phone, I have to say that the phone and Android system are great. The camera sucks, memory is low, but otherwise the phone works very well. Coming from Nokia 521 with Windows system, my experience with Moto e is quite positive. Certain apps I use frequently are better than their Windows versions. As to Tracfone service, no complaints this time, signals have been good so far."
B00PWEN2ZE,W. Segen,3,"motorola may be ok. i have the tracfone zte valet, a triple minutes phone. But you can no longer buy minutes from TF. They offer ""deals"" with exclusion language, like your minutes will not triple. They haven't officially announced it, ttbomk, just slipping it by. good luck. i think TF is over and it's time to move on...."
B00PWEN2ZE,m,4,I like the phone but am not able to check the voice mail remotely with this one. It uses all your minutes checking voice mails from junk callers. Would be nice if it let you check the voice mails from your work phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,Charles Raymond,5,Replaces my Samsung Galaxy 4 which always worked too slow and locked up on me. This phone is much faster on internet and was a lot cheaper.

B00PWEN2ZE,Wilma B.,3,It is too hard to put on.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kace,1,"So this thing id pretty painfully a waste of money. I had it not even 3 days and then it just stopped working, Wont turn on, wont charge, it's batter at full it seemed and yet just nothing. I go to see if maybe its just one of those situations where the battery need to be taken out and back in, Yeah also a no the battery is snuggly infused to the phone via a plastic barrier. In short the thing is garbage Im just glad i only wasted 2 bucks on it my fears to anyone who pays more than that"
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,2,I have the volumn all the way up for speaker and text and you cant hear it or when you talk to him i can barely make out what he is saying Is there something to set ?
B00PWEN2ZE,pd,1,Do NOT get involved with Tracfone. Customer service is nonexistent. I received a phone that didn't work and they said it was more or less my problem. Virtually walked away. Still trying to resolve.
B00PWEN2ZE,Amazon Customer,4,"Pretty good phone. Not as fast as I would like, but not slow either. I bought it so I could use it with my money saving apps like shopkick and ibotta. Unfortunately ibotta isnt supported. When trying to scan receipts you have to be in good light, as the camera doesnt focus on words and barely gets barcodes scanned. Little disappointed in that to be honest. If the camera had a focus option it would be perfect."

B00PWEN2ZE,Lawrence Mobbs,2,"I bought this phone more than a year ago. It works well as other reviews indicate. But, this unit comes with Android 4.4! The current version of Android is in the 7s. Motorola cares not that this unit is not secure on the internet."

B00PWEN2ZE,Stan Kotulak,3,"Nice phone No auto focus camera makes it impossible to read QR code. Real bummer...built-in battery. Not sure how to replace it when necessary, if at all."
B00PWEN2ZE,newton's apple,4,Good little budget phone.
B00PWEN2ZE,John Walsh,2,my available minutes ran out. mucho headache.
B00PWEN2ZE,Steven J. Torrey,5,"The phone has a nice heft to it--it feels solid. But for something that is a communication device--a cell phone--it has a huge drawback. Notification for voicemail alert is a small icon at the very top of the toolbar. A very small icon. It would be easily missed, so a person who relies on voicemail, a person who does not walk around with their phone on a daily basis, uses the phone infrequently--say three times a month--voice mail notification becomes real important--REAL important. And this miniscule notification button just doesn't cut it. And I shouldn't have to rely on installing an app to get appropriate voicemail notification. An app that reduces the phone's security.

The camera is a 5 megapixel front camera--that seems adequate for close up photos; but like all low megapixel cameras--don't expect great clarity with distance shots--like the Golden Gate Bridge.

The best feature is the Tracfone card which gives 60 days service for $19 and 60 minutes of phone calling multiplied times three for 180 minutes with time rolled over when a new card is downloaded before the expiration date of the old card. Again for someone who anticipates using the phone only a few times a month--less than five times--that is a real bargain.

Data cards are available--and the smart phone by android was made for internet web browsing, email, Facebook, Youtube, etc. $9 got 300mb--good for maybe a coupe if weeks, or $19 for 745Mb--good for maybe a month, or $50 for 1 GB--good for maybe a month. Every time the phone is connected to Wi-Fi--there are no deductions from your data plan. So presumably, your data plan could be more flexible than the limitations might suggest.

Having a smartphone without a data plan---without ability to surf the www--is like walking around without clothes--there seems to be something not there in the phone. Is it worth $9 or $19 or $50 to be on the world wide web whilst on the bus? I sure don't think so. But the convenience of having it in certain circumstances makes the smart phone ideal for people who can live without instant connection on the www.

It is more than adequate for surfing the web, for downloading photos, for emailing, for text messaging. But there is a steep learning curve to the machine. Worse--there is no real way to quickly and easily transfer photos from the camera to the computer. Photos can be saved to Google 'MyDrive' or ""Picasa""--but that seems a tad cumbersome. And those photos trapped in the camera means they are not readily available for sharing with relatives. it just seems terribly complicated--not really intuitive. (I have seen videos where USB cable can be connected to the phone and computer and photos transferred. The phone has built in 2 GB of memory plus room for a micro SD card--so presumably--the card can be taken out and attached to the computer to retrieve photos--but again cumbersome. I added a 16 Gb memory card which gives plenty of space for photos. I also found it easy to figure out how to go from Facebook to downloading photos for family/friends to view.

A word of warning: the phone out of the box needs to be powered up--plugged in to give it workable energy before it can be activated. Secondly, the phone comes without its cover. And on the back of the phone is the phone's ID number--without that number, the phone cannot be activated. So before putting on the cover, be sure to read the ID and put it somewhere so the phone can be activated. No ID--No activation. And once that cover is put on, it is extremely difficult to get it off.

The phone from Target did not come with an activation card--just to add to the overall annoyance of activation. Out of the box--it offered little in the way of accessories beyond a cord for recharging the phone; the phone will last with little usage for about a day before it needs recharging.

For a person who doesn't anticipate using the phone more than 5 times a month--tops ten times a month; for a phone used for contact with medical professionals--, for a phone where the owner wants flexibility re connection to the WWW, it is handy, economical, efficient. The price at Target was $99 reduced from about $119 normally. In the end--it seems to be a sound purchase."
B00PWEN2ZE,Whitney McKee,1,"I receive this phone and tried to activate it with Tracfone. After nearly four weeks and over 7 hours of phone conversation with the Tracfone employees, they finally let me know that the ESN number is bad & will not work on the Tracfone server. Even though this is an Amazon verified seller, and they advertise this is a Tracfone, and it come sealed in a Tracfone box, IT'S A LIE"
B00PWEN2ZE,TL,1,The phone was not user-friendly and the apps were very slow. The triple minute card did not work they took days away and made the phone expire before they originally said it would. Worst phone worst customer service of any cell phone company out there. If you do use constantly check or one day you will just lose all service and all minutes. Well before the set day for expiration.
B00PWEN2ZE,rosie smith,1,"Worst phone ever can't get on the net ,face anything hate it"
B00PWEN2ZE,Richard,1,The battery is not remove able.
B00PWEN2ZE,Josue Hernandez,1,There was no mention of which carrier the phone used. I ended up not being able to use the phone and had to return it.
B00PWEN2ZE,Kreig Zimmerman,2,"Let's call it a social experiment.

Fate had conspired to deprive me of my iPhone so I decided to go on the cheap with the theory that mobile phone tech had rapidly accelerated so even a cheap phone might be good. A few months after purchase, I have been disabused of this notion.

1) Wish I had Flash!

I thought getting an uber-fast MicroSD card would make up for the lack of internal memory after or a week or two. Well, now I know better and understand why Google's and Samsung's flagship devices don't offer this option â mainly installation to the card is at app-writer's discretion and often times app updates (which are infuriatingly common) will ""move"" apps back into the anemic 5GB of available space on the phone.

At least the card holds music and photos fine, FWIW...

2) Wish I had a REAL camera.

No digital zoom! It's 2016 FFS! I guess I've learned that a big chunk of a phone's price is the CAMERA functionality!

3) Lag lag lag lag.

On iOS I'd get used to the OS acting as a bouncer and kicking out misbehaving apps. Sure, crash-vanish apps were a problem but at least the phone would keep running smoothly (bar the occasional insta-reboot â whoops, guess someone's app DID write over OS memory!)

With Android on this subpar hardware it is a Confederacy of Lags. You can't possible know why but at times performance crawls and there is no obvious reason.

Using this as a jukebox also made me wish I still had one of my old iPods, sadly.

BOTTOM LINE

Who is this device for?

If you're one of those Millenials who feels the need to shop for someone older and get them a phone, don't bother looking any further than this as you'll be lucky if they use any more than this type of device's limits for functionality.

If you are any younger or used to something with some merit, do not place yourself in bondage to this silly little toy. IOW Gizmodo's review of this model was pretty spot-on."
B00PWEN2ZE,russell,1,never ordered this .
B00PWEN2ZE,LucyH,5,just want 5 stars
B00PWEN2ZE,Holly,4,Good phone but it didn't come with triple minutes as it advertises.I had to add minutes
B00PWEN2ZE,Joe Z,3,"I wanted to upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy Centura to something a bit newer and bigger. I like this phone, not thrilled, but it's a nice, basic Android phone. That said, do not even think of buying from Tracfone ... I did and regret it. But I'm in too deep to get out. Call it paying my stupid tax - the tax I paid for being stupid.

As a phone it's okay. It does everything well. I like the fact that it has a larger screen than my Samsung, has a much better camera, and has a built in radio. That covers my use. A phone, a camera, and a radio. I don't do apps.

My only issue with the phone is it's kind of blah. It's a typical black rectangular phone. The Samsung was way sexier with its rounded corners and metal trim. And it fit my hand better. This just feels like a small brick and takes up more room in my pocket.

Meh."
B00J1SMJ06,Texas Mom,4,We wanted something for our son that just had talk and text capabilities that would work on the AT&T network and this one is perfect. He was previously using and iPhone 3G but cracked the screen really bad so this was our solution because we were not going to spend $$$ on a newer iPhone for him to break. We simply took the sim card out of the iPhone an put it in the LG and it worked immediately. No need to even go to the AT&T store. We did run into some problems when we tried to install a micro sd card so he could listen to music but we found a way to fix that. Apparently it's a known issue that this phone will shut down when you try to play music on it. We didn't see that part when researching the phone but it happened to us too. We were so frustrated and about to return the phone when I had an idea. Although the specs say it can support several types of music formats I ran across something on the internet that said it needed to be mp3. I converted all of the music from wma to mp3 and presto! no more problems with the music player. He listened to music all day yesterday and it never shut down on him. I took off one star for this because it doesn't work as advertised.
B00J1SMJ06,Henry Singer,5,"I wish I hadn't lost my previous 2 phones, neither of which was ever returned. This one has more colorful graphics and a few more features than the previous ones, but doesn't allow me to install my own ringtones (from ZEDGE) as my previous phone did. The AT&T people sneered when I asked them to activate my new Xpression phone, which was discontinued by LG and (according to one sales rep) hasn't been sold by AT&T ""in years"". AT&T salespeople tried desperately to sell me on a smartphone (which is all they sell now, except for a useless ""bare bones"" flip phone) but I resisted and they activated my Xpression anyway. I do not need or want a smartphone (which is much more expensive than my LG ""dumb"" phone [which basically takes and makes calls and messages] and requires a data plan, all of which about doubles what I pay now per month). But if I lose this LG Xpression, can't get another and want to remain with AT&T, I will be stuck. Obviously I intend to keep a closer eye on this phone!"
B00J1SMJ06,Wren,4,"If your looking for a low price phone, then this is a good choice.
I got this for my grandfather, he doesn't really understand a smart phone, and never fully could navigate a flip phone either.
I considered this an affordable happy medium, he can still answer it, and I can keep track of him.
The phone is rather loud for what you would think. It is easy to use.

Pro's are cost, start up time, quick contact access, great standby time on battery, I personally always liked the slider keyboards as well. It made manually adding in all my grandfather's contacts really easy. It also has GPS tracking so I can keep track of my loved ones through the ATT family map.

Con's. I would have preferred a green answer and red disconnect button it's easier for my grandfather. I also prefer the slide out keyboard of the Pantech Crossover. The operating system, you kind of have to either double press or press hard to tap the screen. Also with the internet, it does kind of work. Try and use less graphic oriented websites. You tube actually works. However it reprocesses the image to low resolution and the image is smaller than viewing screen almost like 1"" screen. So just listen for the audio on a you tube video.

So if your trying to avoid a flip phone and don't have a lot of money for a smart phone. If you just need something to send and receive calls, take an occasional picture, and send texting, great phone for it's price. I hope LG tries to make an LG Xpression 3 and see what they do."
B00J1SMJ06,NM,5,"I recently had a Network Issue with my existing AT&T LG Expression 2 Blue (aka LG LGC410) and in the course of ... ....troubleshooting learned that I, as as End User, was responsible for proving the issue was NOT restricted to Just My Phone and was in fact an actual Network Issue. Lucky for me the reps at the local AT&T store could duplicate the issue on their personal AT&T phones, so The Higher Ups had to investigate the problem. Thankfully it appears to be resolved (for now?).

BUT FROM THIS I LEARNED TWO IMPORTANT THINGS
1) AT&T might try to suggest an ""issue"" is Your Phone Alone, so having a spare would be Very Useful.
2) AT&T ***no longer carries*** the LGC410 (Dec 2017). So if one wants to buy or replace one of these - tricky.

Purchase
The only ""basic phone"" available from AT&T circa December 2017 was one flip phone without a keyboard, and sending texts with a flip phone is too backwards even for me. I checked Amazon (of course!) and found several of LGC410s available. I checked back with AT&T support to mention the paradox of ""can't buy one if none are available"" and was told to check out Amazon (a good idea!). Being a chicken, I decided to go with a ""new"" (?) phone that was fulfilled by Amazon with fast-free-shipping. Ordered it, and about two days later it arrived. Yea!

Receiving
However, I really can't say if this is/was a ""new"" phone or not. A smart person (which I am not) would have bought an extra phone back when AT&T still sold them as they aren't that expensive. In Dec 2017, I should be happy that I can still find one of these things. I noticed that Phone #2 didn't arrive in an AT&T box but instead arrived in a generic LG box. Also the battery was pre-installed in Phone #2, and I thought the battery on my 2015 phone was shipped ""disconnected"" from the phone. But it's been two years and I really can't remember.

Activation ?
I read some of the other posts about their phones ""not working"" or ""reported as stolen"" so figured my best bet was to contact AT&T and see if they could check the phone based on it's IMEI number, but was told the only way to confirm whether the phone was Legit or not was to go ahead and activate it. After trekking over to where I had a landline phone, I called them back to give them the info and Rolled The Dice. SUCCESS!
As Phone #2 looks to be alive and not reporting itself as ""stolen"", I figure I might as well just leave it running as the new Primary Phone and stuff Phone #1 in the box. But I did learn a few extra things in the process (?).

Activation Trivia ??
- It would appear that the only way to see if a phone is ""stolen"" or not is to activate it
- I thought they would charge me an activation fee, but they didn't (?!?!)
- Was told they should NOT (don't hold your breath) charge an activation fee *IF*
- - - Same kind of phone (and/or)
- - - Phone #2 uses same kind of SIM card as Phone #1
- - - Can call later and ask to be refunded the activation fee
- But I recall being hit with an activation fee when I originally switched to the LGC410
- Both phones at the time looked to use the same kind of SIM card
- Called support to ask to have the $50-ish fee refunded. Was told ""no"". Got a $25 credit instead. :(
- So cross your fingers and hope for the best! :)

Generic Phone Trivia
The LGC410 is not the most Advanced phone out there, and I had to wipe/erase/reset my phone over the weekend at the... ...suggestion of support. I ended up low-tech hand-writing all contacts onto paper and manually re-entering them (zzz...). Switching phones to test Phone #2 meant I would lose all this info again, and I wanted to be Lazy this time. I noticed I could bulk-copy all the contacts (mostly) to the SIM card as doing it one-by-one kept giving me ""data might be lost"" messages. I noticed that while one could bulk-copy all the contacts, the fields for the SIM card were limited in length-of-name and only allowed 3 numbers per contact. Adjusted contacts for these limitations, and they were present when I powered up Phone #2. Had a few texts of note from this week (all others lost over the weekend) and Being Lazy opted to save them to the SIM card prior to switching phones. But they only re-appeared after I changed to Standard View for messages.

When all is said and done, this was a pretty satisfactory experience as I now have a ""backup phone"" should my active one get lost or decide to go swimming. Although AT&T no longer sells these LGC410s in December 2017, I lucked out and was able to get one in a few days from Amazon (yea!), and it looks to be functioning across the board. Not sure if this is a true ""new"" phone or not, but it looks clean, it works, and it's not being reported as ""stolen"" - that's good enough for me!

Unrelated: I also learned that you can return your store-bought AT&T phone to the store within fourteen days as part of the Buyer's Remorse Program. But there is a flat-non-negotiable restocking fee of $49.00. A ""basic phone"" runs about $49.00 at the store, so you can buy a flip phone for $49 and return it for a $49 restocking fee. ($49 - $49 = 0) Err... And this is why I opted to buy the phone on Amazon. :)"
B00J1SMJ06,Suzanne,3,"It's a pretty good little phone for those of us who don't want to pay mondo bucks to surf the internet on their phone. It does phone calls well and texts. my only issue is, and I had a red one of these a few years ago-same issue, it does not tell you right away you have a Voice mail. it may all of a sudden give off a tone or a vibration randomly when there was seemingly no related phone call, that you have a VM message. When you check it , you find it is related to a missed call from one or two days ago. I just randomly check VM messages to try to solve this. Other than that its pretty reliable and keeps a charge well."
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,2,"My provider recommended this phone to me because I no longer liked the old flip phone with T9 texting.
When I ordered it, I had no idea that the letters were so difficult to read. Even with glasses, I am having a difficult time.
Also it was listed as new, but the charger definately was not. It did not work at all, and you could see that it was used, (dirty).
I had my old LG charger that I am using for it. Also did not come with a user's manual which should be included with all ""new""
phones. Not at all happy with the purchase."
B00J1SMJ06,cori,5,"I recently purchased this phone for my son. It worked out perfectly for him, and he loves it. He loves to slide out keyboard and the easy accessibility to it for texting. It's user-friendly and perfect for a first phone."
B00J1SMJ06,B Brown,2,"pro: I think this is the smallest phone with a physical keyboard. Good looking.
Con: It is unable to receive or send in a low signal area - no bars. My (lost) LG 100C that cost ten dollars could get one bar and have service. A new LG flip phone was likewise unable to use. The Motorola Droid made in 2009 that I just got, gets multiple bars. I wish someone would test phones for their ability to receive a weak signal"
B00J1SMJ06,Liz Francis,5,"I like this model phone because I'm simple minded and this phone is easy to use. I am technically challenged and HATE all the fancy phones.So this phone is perfect for me.. although, they don't always last very long. But Amazon has a very good replacement/return policy so I keep ordering the same phone when I have to replace the one I have."
B00J1SMJ06,quiltnsharron,4,"This is a great little phone. Calls, texts, photographs and a flip out keypad - it's everything I need. The problem is the battery. I'm on my 3rd phone and the battery always becomes a problem in short order. It won't hold a charge. So I go to the battery store and get a new battery. Same problem in very short order. The battery I'm on now is not even a month old . I charge it at night, unplugging it as soon as it's finished and by morning the battery is drained. This is my second battery for this. SO FRUSTRATING."
B00J1SMJ06,S. Modrall,5,My mother loves this phone and when it was discontinued she wanted another. She doesn't like smart phones and just learning how to text so this phone works great for her. Thinking of ordering another as a backup!
B00J1SMJ06,cjlakeside,5,"This is the phone I have had for the last year. Great phone for the price, which, by the way, is cheaper than AT&T. There was nothing wrong with the other phone other than the fact it took a dive into the dishwater. Still worked but back light was too dim after swimming in the water. Taxes pictures, has bluetooth, texting, great phone. Will buy again if something happens to this one, God forbid."
B00J1SMJ06,morgan,5,"Love these phones. These were replacements for LG Xpression 2 phones we already had that had worn out. They are easy to use and don't have all the ""extra"" stuff on them...and they actually fit in your pocketð"
B00J1SMJ06,Angela Frank,5,My 10 yr old loves it. He really wanted a smart phone for his bday but we aren't those parents. :) Perfect for his little fingers and the touch screen gives it that smartphone feel without the smartphone price tag. Would definitely recommend as a starter phone for your little ones.
B00J1SMJ06,E. Esquivel,5,This is a great phone for my young son. We bought it for him to replace a similar one he had to this one that finally died. He wanted one just like his dead one but we could not find one at the at&t store so we fell back an amazon and sure enough we found one really close and even better - according to him - than his last one. Thank you Amazon!
B00J1SMJ06,Calicocoats,3,My vision is not very good and I could not read the tiny text or see the tiny keyboard.
B00J1SMJ06,Mary Deal,4,"Have had this phone for a little over a month. It is hard to see the numbers on the Qwerty keyboard and the light doesn't stay on behind the keys but just a few seconds, even though I've tried everything to adjust that. The blue numbers on the keyboard just don't show up well. This one is improved from the older Xpression in that the ""send"" button for texts is out of the way so it isn't sent before you're through typing t.. I didn't want a smartphone and this one is much better than a flip phone. I'm please with it - especially for texting - it's quick and easy."
B00J1SMJ06,Nessa,5,Great alternative to not having to buy a smart phone for someone who is not tech savvy and prefers phones made 10 years ago.
B00J1SMJ06,Journey B,2,"I got this to replace my son's phone. I got it activated, then within a couple hours, it was shut off by AT&T. When I called, they said it had been reported as a stolen phone. Thanks for that."
B00J1SMJ06,Mithershoe,3,Functions OK but doesn't come with a manual. Its functions are not easy to figure out. A bit of a nuisance to have to so often refer to an online manual for functions that were much more easily performed on my previous Pantech.
B00J1SMJ06,ghost kitty,1,Touch screen does not work all the time and it does not not work around the edge of the screen. I've purchased this phone in the past and had a great experience. This particular one was complete garbage. I felt like I was sold a broken phone.
B00J1SMJ06,drummindog,5,Perfect replacement for one a like one that broke. Didnât want to play the upgrade game with my carrier.
B00J1SMJ06,"K, S and Z Family",4,We bought this item for a older family member who has a difficult Rhine using her hands. We took it to a cell phone provider to set it up.
B00J1SMJ06,biscuit,3,"The touch phone was hard to work. You really had to press hard on some of the apps in order to use it. Also, when I scroll there was no control. It would just go fast pass everything."
B00J1SMJ06,Barbara Binegar,4,Good sturdy phone. This is my third phone like this. Very sturdy.
B00J1SMJ06,Ann,5,Great little phone for someone that wants a basic one. Pretty good camera.
B00J1SMJ06,winstu,1,Phone was okay the first few weeks then it started turning off and on by itself sometimes during a call. Very frustrating. No way to fix that issue. Return window expired so i am stuck with this useless piece of junk. . Had to buy another phone. I would not recommend this product.
B00J1SMJ06,Bob S.,5,Good basic phone for us who don't have our face buried in one all day!!!!!!!!!
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,4,"This is a GREAT and very useful low tech and budget friendly phone while I save up for the hi end. The slide out keyboard makes it all work easily for my texting. There are options to go on line and surf, but I have a desktop computer for those kind of things. This gets me around town without worrying if I will leave or drop it. It's OK!"
B00J1SMJ06,Songbird12818,4,"The phone arrived in great condition and looked like new. We took it to our local AT&T store to transfer items from our old phone to the new one. When the AT&T rep moved the sim card from the old to the new phone, we lost all contacts and settings. That was a BIG disappointment. Otherwise, the phone has worked great so far."
B00J1SMJ06,Tammy Clark,5,Brother in law loved it. He wanted a simple phone like he was used to.
B00J1SMJ06,Thomas E. Hoffman,5,This has worked out great as a first phone for my 11 year old daughter. It is kind of hilarious because it flies into pieces with any drop -- like a smash up derby car for those of you old enough to remember those -- but then goes back together without a hitch. Whether or not this is actually good for teaching a kid to take care of a future more expensive phone remains to be seen
B00J1SMJ06,jdub,5,Excellent value for the money. Very easy to use for someone who wants a basic phone. The keypad is very small for someone with larger fingers. Battery life long. Would buy again.
B00J1SMJ06,Ariampoco,5,Exactly what was needed for my mom- a basic phone to use for calls and good price compared to buying new through our carrier. Arrived quickly as pictured and works well for her needs.
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,4,I bought this for my mom since she doesn't have Amazon. She needed a phone that was simple to use and this is exactly like the one she had. It was brand new and works perfectly for her. She loves it! It arrived quickly and as described.
B00J1SMJ06,"Books, bikes and boats",5,"For the last of the smart phone hold-outs, like me, this is a great product."
B00J1SMJ06,mike.h,5,if you don't like smart phones or cant operate one yet then this phone is a great starter for you. it has the touchscreen and some options that will get you used to operating a screen mean while providing you the ease of understanding the operating system and being able to use the phone.
B00J1SMJ06,I&#60;3MyWife!,4,It arrived fully charged and with a charger cable as expected. Everything works! Great deal. I omitted 1 star because it was kind of dirty and I had to clean it. I would still recommend this seller. :)
B00J1SMJ06,Linda M. Sampson,5,I am assuming everything is fine. Have not heard any complaints
B00J1SMJ06,songpill kim,2,"The sim card was missing, and even though we ordered a new phone, inside of the phone where you put in the battery and sim card, there was some sort of sticky substance that was a bit yellow and some of the residue left even after I wiped it off. What can I do with this one?"
B00J1SMJ06,DGF,1,"I bought this for my mom, and unfortunately after having it for only a short time we are unhappy with the quality of the calls this phone makes. Mom can hear other people just fine, but we can barely hear her (and yes, we've tried adjusting everything we can think of). This phone is pretty useless for making phone calls since you can't hear what the person is saying. I am very disappointed."
B00J1SMJ06,Edward Varley,4,"Works fine, hard to learn."
B00J1SMJ06,Gabe,2,Phone works great. But when I took it in to activate they pointed out that the battery has water damage. (You can tell by looking on the battery. There is a little round circle that should be white. It turns red if there is water damage.)
B00J1SMJ06,A. Childs,5,Wife says it's all she needs or wants in a phone
B00J1SMJ06,DD,1,"Phone stopped working after 4 months! It was never dropped or mistreated- it just stopped texting or calling. We tried replacing SIM card, troubleshooting at a phone store, but no luck. Company did not reply to request for service or refund. We wasted $50 on this phone! Very disappointing."
B00J1SMJ06,Mel-luv,4,"My daughter loved this phone, til she fried it with water ;)"
B00J1SMJ06,KL,5,Phone works great and was in really good condition. I purchased as a Birthday gift for my cousin who is scared of smartphone's.... She loves it!!
B00J1SMJ06,ToriS,4,It works i guess. No bads so far.
B00J1SMJ06,J.D. Faircloth,5,"If you just need a simple cell for calling & TXT, this phone is perfect! The slide out keyboard is AWESOME. I had to contact Energy Electronics about a unlock code, 3 months after the purchase, & they acted as if I was buying it now. You should buy from them, they ""understand"" good customer service."
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,3,Battery life is short
B00J1SMJ06,Joseph C. Martinak,1,NEVER go cheap on a phone. I will Never buy a second hand phone again.

B00J1SMJ06,Antoinette M. Williamson,5,"Excellent reception, clarity and works as expected."
B00J1SMJ06,workingforaliving,4,I gave it to my father to replace a broken LG Xpression. He likes that it's easy to use and performs the basic calling and messaging functions.
B00J1SMJ06,JHay,3,"The screen is really small. I bought this for my father because he likes the slider phones, and got it to replace a Virgin mobile slider, not realizing the screen would be this small."
B00J1SMJ06,Tammy Berg,5,Works great for my 8 year old. Fits our needs.
B00J1SMJ06,patricia holder,4,Good
B00J1SMJ06,mary,3,"I have dropped it several tiimes, slippery. The small squares are difficult for my fingers to hit the correct one."
B00J1SMJ06,Lois Shuman,5,Just like my old phone that bit the dust when it was dropped (for the 500th time). No learning curve!
B00J1SMJ06,Sheryl A. Higginbotham,2,Don't like it very much. Too difficult to use.
B00J1SMJ06,Kathleen McVey,1,Sent back due to have to change carriers and number!
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,4,"This is my second non smart phone. I only need a basic phone and this one is good. I have a bit of a problem because the touch screen is so sensitive but I am getting better using it. I am looking forward to using it at least as long as my first one, five years. Time will tell."

B00J1SMJ06,info.,5,This was exactly what my husband wanted. Very satisfied.
B00J1SMJ06,Darryl J.,5,Came in perfect condition. Great phone for a 12 year old who is not very careful with her things.

B00J1SMJ06,Gichick,1,"Never worked. It would just turn on and off over and over. The first one we got worked for 2-3 months and then stopped, so we ordered another. Not going to order anymore."
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,1,"Phone is used by an older person who is legally blind - this means the phone doesnât get heavy usage. The screen began to continuously freeze up about the 3rd week. By the time I was aware, and went to AT&T, the warranty was expired. Iâm not happy!!"

When I do upgrade, it will not be with ATT.

B00J1SMJ06,Sarah,1,"Got the phone for my 11 year olds birthday in October and by the end of November, it's stopped working. About 2 weeks ago text messages starting coming through weird. Then last weekend in the middle of a movie, the phone started making noises out of nowhere causing us to have to walk out so we didn't disturb everyone. Now starting this week, the touch screen lights up, but there's no functionality to it. AT&T can't help and because the touch screen doesn't work you can't call or text because you need to touch the screen. The phone is completely useless in less than 2 months."

B00J1SMJ06,realpepperman,1,I hate the phone too small screen is too small and when they up loaded my contacts 255 of them I am still trying to correct and find the ones Iuse the most for work.....they loaded the names in backwards so first name is in the last name place and some of the names got deleted. My picture are loads but I can not access them due to the phone does not like the format....it really sucks.......
B00J1SMJ06,Stacia Snapp,3,"Be aware that this comes with ZERO directions. Not even a single sheet of ""quick start"" info about how to insert the SIM card or even turning on the phone.

I THOUGHT this would be a perfect solution.
I've always had good look with LG.
This refurbished/abused thing has had a hard life though.
Battery will not stay charged.
unit will not turn on unless it's plugged in, and then it dies in about ten minutes.
Still has a ton of crap on it from the previous owner.
Not happy in the least."
B00J1SMJ06,vilmarinyc,1,"STOLEN PHONES!!!! I purchased this phone for my mother because we didnât want a smartphone. After spending hours on the phone with AT&T, they informed me that the phone was reported stolen in November 2015 so they would not remove from a blacklist. I wasted hours dealing with this, but worst of all, I had to tell my mom that we had to return her phone because it had been stolen. Embarrassing and infuriating! Save yourself the hassle."

B00J1SMJ06,April Flaherty,2,"Had many issues with the phone, and the worse part was that I loved it. Unresponsive touch screen and once that goes, the buttons that work can only do so much."
B00J1SMJ06,Natty-bo,5,"This is my current phone with AT&T. It's the best phone I've ever had (I've bought multiple smartphones that glitched so bad out of the box I immediately returned them and bought a flip phone instead). I hate smartphones and don't need to be connected to the internet wherever I am, unlike what most people believe these days. I honestly feel more free not being a slave to facebook and the internet.

At first, I was worried the keypad would be hard to adjust to. I've had a slider phone in the past, and my fingers, despite being pretty small, had a hard time hitting the right keys. On this phone, I've never had that issue. They keypad feels so right to me, I could never go back to touchscreen keypads (they are the bane of my existence). There aren't many usable features on this phone, but I'm assuming if you're looking at this phone to begin with, you're not necessarily looking for a smartphone anyway. Internet doesn't work at all for me. It spends forever trying to load, and when it finally does, it's such a pain to navigate the internet with this. Last few times I even tried the internet (it's been a good few months), it didn't load anything at all and I just gave up. Could be an operating system error, but could also be a service error. Too bad AT&T is so horrible I'll never know for sure. My last slider was the LG Rumor 2 (I'm guessing that's the model just before this one), and the internet worked slow, but fine, so it really might not be this phone after all. BTW, this phone is much better in my opinion than the Rumor 2.

First off, this thing is sturdy as anything. I've spiked this on the ground sooo many times, and even put a small hole in my wall where I threw it once. Immediately after being thrown into the wall, a text came through, like it wasn't affected at all (lucky for me). I have a case and screen protector, and I think these things have helped it hold up as long as it has (I've owned it 1 year and ten months now). You wont find anything this sturdy on a smartphone (when smartphones take a tumble, it messes up with the way it functions over time, and will eventually stop working in a way that you could even use it).

Texting is great. Honestly, the worst part about the messaging system in this is: A) you have to begin an MMS message BEFORE writing something long and drawn-out, otherwise it cuts you off at 160 characters and you need to finish in a whole new text message (it has confused the people I'm texting on many an occasion), and B) you can't save a specific text. There are times I've wanted to lock a message so that it saves when I delete all my other messages, but this isn't an option. You would have to manually delete individual messages around that message, which is unrealistic when you've got 300+ texts to erase. So that's a little disappointing, but not a deal-breaker.

My only problem has really been with calling. Since I bought the phone, occasionally people can't hear my end of the call. It was a VERY rare occurrence at first, but since my phone is getting pretty ragged at this point, it's almost constant. Sometimes it's a problem with AT&T/possibly the other person's service company, but I know at least a good bit of the time it's my phone. I don't/can't use it for calling anymore, so these last 2 months of my contract, I'm paying $50 a month for text, which really hurts to do. However, I work at a restaurant/carry-out, and a LOT of our customers' calls are exactly the same way, and when I answer the phone no one's there, so I do know it's a common service problem. Therefore I don't know how much of that can even be blamed on my phone (I would honestly believe that AT&T does it on purpose for me since I don't have a smartphone, I've had endless problems with them as a company).

Overall, this phone makes me so happy that I don't have a smartphone. I really do think I will buy this exact phone again once I get more money in (I'm leaving my contract and won't get another one for free with an upgrade). If I don't buy this exact phone, it will definitely be a slider phone, but from my experience with this one, this is probably one of the best ones they've ever made."
B00J1SMJ06,Jessica K.,4,"Good call-and-text phone. This is a basic phone with basic functions. Do not buy this if you are expecting to use the camera as it is only 2MP. This LG is a great non-smartphone. I downgraded to the Xpression2 after I grew tired of paying the high costs of upgrades, data, smartphone fees, etc associated with having the latest fad smartphone. The LG Xpression has phenomenal battery life. I only charge it every 3 or 4 days. Texts are easy to send on the slide-out keyboard. I use the Mobile Web to check weather and news headlines occasionally. I am satisfied with this phone."
B00J1SMJ06,Mars,1,"""Upgraded"" to this phone from the Samsung Flight (original), because my Samsung phone couldn't hold a charge anymore.

First impressions: wasn't impressed at all. This phone is basically the same as the Xpression 1, just different color.

- Interface and icons are not user friendly. On/off buttons are | and O respectively, but they don't tell you that unless you read the manual. Could've just used ON or OFF instead, but I guess they wanted to be difficult. You'll need to download the manual off of LG's website because a regular manual is not included inside the box. Had to look at the manual for explanation of what icons are for what functions, whereas my old Samsung was easy to figure out.

- Address book/contacts sporadically takes a long time to load (sometimes over a minute). Other times it's instant. Does not have a ""search"" function. For example, if you have a lot of contacts on your phone, you'll have to manually scroll down to the desired name to get the number. With my old phone, you could type in the first letter of the person's name, and it'll show their info.

- Widgets (clock icons, calendar icons, etc) are a complete mess. Good luck trying to position it on your screen. Dragging the icons to the desired position on the screen is a pain. Taking them off screen is even worse. If you like having a clock (digital or analog) on your screen, you'll need to drag the clock icon to the screen. It's fairly large, so if you have personal wallpaper (like a photo) as your background, you'll end up blocking a good chunk of it. It would've been so much easier if they could display the time in the upper right hand corner like most other phones do.

- Screen is slightly distorted/blurry when viewing horizontally. Vertical viewing is fine though.

- Camera sucks. Screen is grainy and blurry when trying to take pictures. My Samsung phone had a 2mp camera as well, but it was much clearer on screen.

- Stored pictures take forever to load.

- Using a stylus pen will not work on this phone.

Bottom line, if you like your old phone, don't ""upgrade"" to this one unless you really have to.

Edit: Phone says it accepts multimedia messages, but after 1 hour of troubleshooting with AT&T tech support, it apparently doesn't work. Not a deal breaker for me, but with everything else I don't like about this phone, I'm just going to return this phone and try out another one.

Double Edit: I returned this phone and got the Pantech Vybe instead. Here's my review on the Vybe: http://www.amazon.com/review/RL81D0MA0CZT9

First impressions: Much cleaner and user friendly interface over the LG Xpression 2. Icons were labeled, unlike the LG. On/Off buttons were labeled as such, and not | and O. Everything was fairly easy to figure out, without having to read the manual. There's a digital clock at the top right like every other phone (except the Xpression 2). There's a search function in the address book/contacts.

Important note: AT&T says the Pantech Vybe requires a data plan on their website, but it does not. If ordering and any site you buy from requires you to purchase it with a data plan, just call up AT&T and tell them to remove the data plan or put a data block in place.

In short, if you are looking for a basic text messaging phone to upgrade to, I'd definitely give the Pantech Vybe a try over the LG Xpression 2."
B00J1SMJ06,ab86,5,Great Product!!
B00J1SMJ06,"Doug Roberts, Author",4,"Let's get one thing out of the way first. This is not a smart phone. It is a pretty good feature phone designed to do just about anything that has to do with text. Text! The slide out keyboard is a tad small but it enables me to write notes and text messages with minimal effort. It can do text related tasks from writing and receiving text messages and notes to .... drum roll... reading books on it using it as an e-reader. What? Really! (More on that later.)

I suppose I am a little different than most users because the feature I like best about it has to do with the way it interacts with my Honda Insight's blue tooth Hands Free Link. The phone pairs with my car just fine and I can answer calls by pressing a button on the steering wheel. I love this feature.

But let's get to the text tricks. The built in browser can load text websites just fine, even ones light on images. I read news articles on text formatted websites. NPR has a news site using text only. But my favorite is Inter Press News Service.

More texting abilities: I can log on to Facebook Mobile and check FB messages and even write a FB note if I want. Cross platform notes using FB! It does Twitter too. I can also check my ATT Yahoo email using the built in browser. The browser only does the most simple websites but even so I can check the weather on the accuweather site. The number of text sites and sites with minimal graphics was more than I expected.

The phone has a few other tricks it can do. If you buy a sim card for it you can use it as a good MP3 player. I use the AUX port of my Honda Insight to plug the phone into it and play music through the car's stereo using the phone's music player. (It will take up to a 32 gb sm card.) You will need that size if you start down loading books into it!! Yes, I am getting to that!

The phone's camera is pretty basic, doing 2 mega pixel photos (1600x1200). If your lighting is good you can use the built in editor to adjust the image's levels, color levels, crop, sharpen, and many more tweaks. You can get a passable photo this way. You can also take videos with this phone as well.

You can browse photos on the phone swiping on the touch screen using the photo widget. You can send reduced images while browsing photos, but I discovered a way to upload the full size image to Facebook Messages. Facebook Mobile, via the browser, is the key. Once you have the Facebook website loaded touch the messages option. When you create a new message you have the option to just send a photo and this actually works!! I send photos I have taken with the phone to myself and friends via this function. I about fell off my chair the first time a photo started to upload and completed successfully!!

Because the phone is so basic you cannot pick from a huge bunch of apps. But it has several built into it: Calculator, Calendar to make appointments, Notes function which you can send as text messages or to an email account. It has alarms which you can set.

The phone has a built in voice recorder which can be pretty handy.

A recent feature I came across is number blocking! I use this a lot now. There are a couple of ways to block a number. I save the spam call to my contacts list. Then, I press the settings icon to get me to the screen which shows ""Call"". It is a green icon. I scroll down to where I see call reject and follow the options.

Ok, about those books. Go to the website BooksInMyPhone.com. They have hundreds of books to download formatted for basic feature phones like this one. Once they are downloaded you install and launch them like you would an app. Who knew a feature phone could be an e-reader?! It is!

No it is not a smart phone. But as a feature phone, it is pretty good for what it is -- especially if you buy a big sim card for it to use for your music and e-books."
B00J1SMJ06,SandmanSXi,4,"I've read many reviews on this thing and it seems to be a hit or miss. My phone works well. I've had it for two years and it still works great. This phone is extremely durable, but whenever you drop it, the battery cover falls off and the phone explodes into 3 pieces (phone, battery, and cover). But the phone itself is fine. It can be extremely slow, especially when you have alot of data like texts or contacts. For awhile, it served as my mp3 player too. It sounds pretty damn good for a basic phone. But then again, I have an awesome pair of headphones. But like I said, it is slow at loading alot of data. I have almost 2000 songs on my 32gb SD card and this phone takes FOREVER to load the damn Artists page. Other than that, it works pretty well. Texting and calling are super basic. My only complaint is that the touch screen is too sensitive and you might accidently end the call during one. And this phone can only hold 500 text messages at a time, so if you're a crazy texter, you'll probably be deleting your messages a couple times a day."
B00J1SMJ06,Stray Cat,3,"The sound is rather muddy but is improved if you change the setting from ""stereo"".

The touch screen is very sensitive yet it is more difficult than average to use the touch screen to end a call.

Using the zoom on the camera is quite cumbersome and not user friendly. The settings don't appear until you touch the screen, and then the ""slide"" is quite small and too close to the other buttons on the touch screen, leading it to close instead of slide. And the zoom isn't that impressive--my 4 year old phone did a better job.

Deleting a photo is easy. Whee.

Texting: well, if you have texted certain contacts recently, it will pull those up immediately but if you want to text someone else, it is a several step process to do that."
B00J1SMJ06,Karen,5,"Got this phone when it was new and the latest thing before iPhones and smart phones so it's got to be 7-8 years old. Still works perfectly. I'm ordering a replacement battery for the first time. I text about 75-100 texts per day. I don't need camera or camcorder capabilities so I don't use that much. It angers me when I get made fun of for not having a big cumbersome smartphone, but the laughs on them--I only pay $42 a month for an unlimited everything plan for my old phone!! If I want to go online I use my Kindle or tv. Tech I have. I just don't want to waste money on redundancy."
B00J1SMJ06,mejo14,1,The phone is OK for phone calls but don't try to play music as the phone restarts after each track. ATT replaced the phone twice and Lg has tried to fix it twice and no one will admit that there is a software glitch in the music app. I finally got ATT to agree to give me credit to purchase a replacement phone of another mfg. after 5 months of aggravation dealing with ATT and LG. This came about when I called the cancel line and told ATT to cancel my account.
B00J1SMJ06,RavRaz,1,"I have had this phone for about 8 months now; I ""upgraded"" from an older Samsung that worked great, but had started to malfunction due to age and wear and tear. This phone is terrible. At least 1/3 of the calls I made get dropped due to my phone hitting the hang up on the touch screen, even when the phone is LOCKED and the touch screen is not supposed to work. Furthermore, the texting function is just awful, awful, awful. The phone can only hold about 200 text messages before they all have to be deleted, so I am constantly deleting messages with is a pain and time consuming. Also, in group texts, only the phone number of the sender shows up, even if they are in my phone book, so I never have any clue who is texting me. Furthermore, the threaded messages screen for any particular texting conversation was so idiotically designed that if a message is longer than 4 lines, it is impossible to read the bottom of the message. Only the top can be seen. Good luck guessing what your friends were trying to tell you, because that is what I have had to do. Also, there is no way to open up ""saved"" message drafts (even though they let you save them), so texts need to be sent right away. Lastly, and perhaps worst of all, this phone constantly makes inadvertent phone calls to random numbers in my phone book, even when the phone is ""locked"" and the calling function shouldn't work. I have inadvertently called people who I haven't spoken to in years at 3:00 in the morning because of this flaw. This phone is literally the worst. THE WORST."
B00J1SMJ06,BV,1,"I've owned a cell since 1993. I've had good, I've had bad. I've had broken. But I've never had a new phone that would qualify as nearly non-functional by design, until I got an LG Xpression 2.

Of course, the primary issue is the touchscreen, which a phone like this shouldn't even have. The touchscreen is both so sensitive that keys press when you hold it up to your ear, yet so insensitive it takes 5-6 presses on the screen to register a function such as, say, selecting the Phone icon. Oh, that's right, this awful thing tries to pretend to be a smartphone, so you actually have to unlock it and select the phone icon at the bottom left. After about 10 seconds of trying, you may even see the keypad come up. But, people today buy things like this because we need, like, a phone, not a wannabe smartphone thingy with a million widgets we don't need - which is why we don't have a smartphone in the first place. But, even if this were to be a half-arsed smartphone, it would need a functional touchscreen, which this does not have. For some widgets, like the calendar, simply touching the screen to select the text entry or time isn't enough - you have to mash the screen for 3-5 seconds before the phone recognizes that you want to input something where you touched.

It doesn't help that widgets only display a page at a time, but that some settings are between ""pages"". Again, using the calendar as an example, you may be able to fill out the text and the start time of an appointment (if the awful touchscreen will let you), but then you have to swipe down for more options. The end time is between pages, so if you want to select that, you have to flip back and forth between the first and second pages and hope you get it. Actually, don't bother - the screen isn't sensitive enough or accurate enough for that to work.

As for the slide-out keypad. Well, it's decent. Keys are hard. Assuming you can get into text mode (which requires the use of the awful touchscreen) it does the job with no frills. Keep track of how much you type because the phone doesn't tell you how many characters you use or have left. Receiving texts is, of course, extremely cumbersome, because you have to fiddle with an acknowledgement on the touchscreen, even if you're in the habit of sliding out the keypad.

I would also like to point out that my previous phone, also from LG, was the VX9100 Env2. That was a great phone, other than the weirdly-shaped '2' key on the front keypad. Everything made sense. on the Xpression 2, however, nothing does. Why there is a touchscreen on a phone for this type of market makes absolutely zero sense. But, if you're going to put one on, at least put a functional one on."
B00J1SMJ06,isaac krakauer,1,"this is the worst piece of junk own... first off I'm 18 and I'm pretty good with electronics and some of the setting they basically hide. about 2 months into owning this thing the touch screen started failing, if the screen registers a tap at all (odds of that are around 1 in 5 when it feels like it) it will register the tap in the wrong place. you can't send a message without using the touch screen to hit the ""send"" button, if it does hit the right spot its all laggy. so the phones texting ability suckkkss, so why not call the person? nope, the speaker is low quality and low volume... over all this is the worst phone i have or will ever own, i was ever in an emergency that required the me to use this piece of junk asap it would get me killed.."
B00J1SMJ06,parentsof3girls&2boys,1,"Oh how I hate this phone. I have even purchased a used older phone to replace it but am back to this one now due to Bluetooth for my motorcycle helmet. The music player shuts the whole phone down when trying to go to the next track. I have sent one phone back just to find the same on the new replacement sent, must be a software glitch. I have almost gotten past hanging up on people with my face, I lock the screen after I answer or dial, but when calling someone it still happens sometimes as it unlocks itself when they answer. Texting isn't too bad, but I'd rather talk to people than text. LG, you guys really dropped the ball on this one, and maybe on purpose to force us all to switch to ""smart""phones, but I don't want to pay for data and am stuck with this crap."
B00J1SMJ06,Mo,3,"I purchased one of these a while back because my LG Expression (red) was worn out. If you like to listen to music on your phone DO NOT BUY this phone. If you try to play a play list or listen to an album it will shut down and reboot your phone. This is a programming flaw. I took it back to the local ATT store and they tried three of their floor models and they all did the same thing. I gave the 2 to someone else in the family and bought another original. The red ones last a long time, even under rough handling."
B00J1SMJ06,Mark Kanzler,1,"Worst phone ever.
No one can hear me, and it's hard to hear them.
Screen constantly shuts off during phone calls so that when asked ""Press 1 for PC help, 2 for Applications, etc"" there is no dialpad, just a black screen.
This phone was foisted upon me by the company I work for; if it were my own phone, I would run it over with my car."
B00J1SMJ06,Kimberly S.,1,"Bought one from the AT&T store, and my son was excited for about 20 minutes before he started complaining that the touch-screen, saying that it started to glitch. The phone kept turning on in his pocket and started dialing people. Then, about a month later, he accidentally dropped it on the floor from about 3 feet. The screen completely broke and had black spots all over it. I would NEVER recommend this phone for anybody."
B00J1SMJ06,Dave,1,"This phone was sold to me as being able to play music. It will not play music in the ""shuffle"" mode. It will play 1 - 3 songs and does a reset and shuts off. This is the 3rd one of these I have had (previous ones were replaced by AT&T). I have had this 3rd phone sent to the LG repair facility in Ft. Worth Texas, THREE times. They either cannot or will not fix the phone. The phone is still under warranty.

The repair personnel in Ft. Worth are totally incompetent.

It is too bad I have to even give this thing even 1 star!"
B00J1SMJ06,Sarah,2,"I hate this phone. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with it for the time being. You're going to hang up on calls constantly with your ear. You are going to have to hit 12 buttons before you can make a call using the dial pad and 12 to hang up, especially if you get a text while on a call. Half the time the touch screen doesn't work until you're in the middle of a call... at which time you hang up on someone. You will butt dial constantly. It freezes up and has to be restarted ALL THE TIME. This phone is a pain in the butt, but the last regular texting phone anyone makes."
B00J1SMJ06,Jim E,1,"Worst ever non-smart phone. There is no password lock for the screen. Place phone in pocket and if it rotates upside down, it will unlock itself, and random dial your contacts!

Phone prone to random shut downs and reboots. Great to have it shut down while you are waiting for a call, and then you get voice mail instead."
B00J1SMJ06,LFM,5,"I am thrilled to have a brand new querty slider! I've been searching for quite awhile. I am not an AT&T customer, so learning how to quickly get a contact, etc. The pre-set carrier stuff is a bit of a snag, but having all the other phone features is great. Works very well."
B00J1SMJ06,berger go,2,"its getting frozen very fast, and turned off while you spooking on the phone"
B00J1SMJ06,Chatz,1,The touch is horrible. It reacts 6 seconds after I push a something. Would recommend a regular smart phone
B00J1SMJ06,madiosn sayre,1,The phone works great but the battery doesnât hold a charge. We charge it all night and it lasts 5 mins. Can someone please contact me. This is unacceptable!
B00J1SMJ06,Gabriella,4,I bout this for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it the only bad part was wen she got it she butt dialed 911 the screen is very touchy
B00J1SMJ06,Jonathan W Cobb,4,"Great, although I cannot really buy music, which I had hoped to do. The widgets are useful, and my contacts haven't filled. Overall, it is a great phone."
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,5,Very grateful to have a working phone for my son! Thank u for prompt service and good product!
B00J1SMJ06,Amazon Customer,1,"Awful user interface. Touch screen will not allow you to remove ""widgets"" once you put them on the screen, which is easy to accidentally do.
Terrible sound.
Constantly drops calls.
Cannot upload pictures to internet (twitter, Facebook, nothing.)
OK for texting BUT
Do. Not. Buy. This. Awful. Phone.
Don't look at it. Do not talk to it.
If you see this phone at a party, pretend you don't know it."
B00J1SMJ06,Cathy L. Price,4,Simple cheap phone for calling and texting. I got this for my 70 year old mother who still had a flip phone but was texting more and more. Camera is useless.

B00J1SMJ06,Samuel R. Evens,1,"Worst phone ever built. AT&T should be ashamed of itself for foisting this piece of crap on the public. I am never going

B00Q1U31VI,MB,5,"I'm a young smartphone denier. After a long search, this is the phone for me. It may be the phone for you too, especially if you are willing to use it on AT&T's gophone network OR Airvoice Wireless or other AT&T MVNO, or if you are willing to pay to have it unlocked. You don't have to unlock this phone for it to work on airvoice. 20$ a month for unlimited SMS/MMS/calls. Boom.

------------------
Good things:
------------------
1) Cheap as poo and widely available
-this is self explanatory

2) Is not itself poo
-I have only had this phone for about a week, BUT I'm relatively certain that it will be good for the long haul. I will update this in the future. I considered waiting to write this review until I had owned the phone for longer and could more meaningfully speak to its status as poo or as non-poo, but I wanted to get this review out before the phone was replaced with an updated version (like this one did for the low-level beloved Z431).

3) Typing is good
-the GUI is a little laggy, but the typing is not and the buttons are very very clicky and super satisfying. Easy to press. Yay. One small downside here is that the bottom row of letter keys is shifted a little bit to the left of where they are on most other qwerty phone keyboards, but I became used to it by day two. Bottom line, the experience of sending texts with this phone is very good.

4) Camera is usable in that adorabad kind of way
-it takes videos too!

5) Micro SD storage
-32 gigs. That's like, a lot of space. The music player is totally not bad, the headphone jack is totally normal and works in a notably normal kind of way, and with that much storage you can take serious quantities of 2MP pictures and videos with your adorabad camera. Also this phone has the built in ability to let you record your phone calls (???), so you can do a lot of that too if you, like me, suddenly find the need to do that upon getting this phone.

6) Good reception
-Yep! The reception is just straight-up good. I purchased the motokey ex117 prior to this phone, in my search for a qwerty non-smartphone which I could use on airvoice wireless that was less than 50 dollars, and it had such terrible reception that I could not use it inside my apartment (but if I walked outside it was fine). My apartment is not a ""dead zone"". Now, I'm a 25 year old non-smartphone-user writing a 5 star review for a flipping gophone on amazon dot com, clearly my expectations are not exactly stratospheric but it's 2015 and I need my phone to work *inside my home*.

7) Text messaging ""app"" displays your exchanges in conversation mode
-like a smartphone. this is very nice. like, you can see your texts and your friend's responses all on the same screen. 2015.

8) Allows for separate ring, vibrate, and silent modes.
-OK now this might just be me but I want ALL THREE of those effing modes and I did not realize how important it was to me until I went on this cheap feature-phone rampage and realized how many of them don't let you do this easily. With this phone you just set the ""Meeting"" profile to vibrate only, and then you can toggle between ringing and silent with the volume rocker and flip to vibrate by holding down the space bar. Nice.

9) Calendar seems totally usable
-I don't use it myself because I carry a paper planner (lol), but I messed around with it a bit and it is pretty intuitive and has ""week"" display mode.

----------------
Bad things:
----------------
1) The whole phone locking situation
-This is, in my opinion, the greatest downfall of this phone. You CAN lock the phone so that it can't push buttons in your pocket and butt dial your thesis advisor, but it is implemented very poorly. When locked in this manner, pressing any of the normal buttons on the front of the phone will not do anything (unless you press the two buttons in succession which unlock the phone), BUT pressing the dedicated power button on the top-right side of the phone, *one time*, UNLOCKS THE PHONE SO THAT ALL THE BUTTONS CAN BE PRESSED. This is, clearly, a serious design flaw. I have not found any way around it, and if someone else has please let me know and I will update this.

Also on the phone locking, when the phone is locked you are still able to press a strange ""SOS"" key which allows you to dial the pre-programmed emergency numbers (911 and 112. no you cannot remove them from the phonebook. Yes, very annoying.) without unlocking the phone. This means that you could potentially butt-dial 911. However, I think it would be pretty hard to do this because of how many menus your butt would have to accurately navigate.

This phone does have a timed auto-lock that you can set, which makes all of this a little less bad. But overall, it's a pretty annoying problem. For thirty dollars though, I will deal. It's not a dealbreaker for me because I usually carry my phone in a bag where it is not prone to having buttons pressed, but for someone else this could be a dealbreaker.

2) You can't change the default APN settings for the web browser or email.
-Essentially, this means that you can't use data on this phone unless you are using the GoPhone or AT&T network. So for example, if you got this phone and wanted to use it with Straight Talk as your provider (which as far as I know you can in fact do without unlocking this phone), you would not be able to get on the internet or receive email with this phone even if your plan includes a little data. For me, this does not matter because I have no interest in being able to browse the internet or receive emails on this phone. For you, it might be a dealbreaker.

Notably, multimedia messaging does not suffer from this same problem and it was very easy to set up MMS on Airvoice's network for me. Unlimited pics. Nice.

---

Sooooooo ya! That's my feels overall. I like this phone because it's widely available and super cheap. I like typing on it A LOT. I have a weirdly profound love for the camera. The GUI is laggy but not so laggy that it will make you angry. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else trying to get or stay off the smartphone train who is willing to use this phone on AT&T or Airvoice or another AT&T MVNO or is willing to pay to have it unlocked."
B00Q1U31VI,Grumblybear,5,"Just what I wanted for my 13 y.o. who's addicted to YouTube and games. I didn't want him to have a smart phone, but I was finding more and more times when I wanted to be able to reach him (e.g.: this summer when he's out and about in the neighborhood, or when pick-up/drop-off changes occur). I didn't use any of the pre-paid plans that came with the phone because they were all more expensive than our Friends and Family plan. So I just headed over to the AT&T store and had them add this phone to our plan. The only ""problem"" with this phone is that I thought he'd only be able to text and talk, but he can, in fact, access the Internet and stream videos and music. So we still had to battle about that (and he has to turn it in at night)."
B00Q1U31VI,PDT,5,"I purchased this phone for my teenager because I wanted a phone that would discourage constant use of internet. I just wanted something he could use to call and text, and this phone fits this requirement perfectly. Just order and activate a standard SIM card from your phone carrier, pop it in, and the phone works perfectly. The web browser on this phone is old school, and quite frankly terrible, and there are no apps, and no wifi - perfect for a teenager you don't want wasting time playing games and watching youtube all day on his phone. Aside from the really poor web browser, the only other way to use data on this phone is by sending/receiving photo texts. Plus, I bought this phone new dirt cheap. If he loses the phone, he can spend his own money buying an inexpensive replacement."
B00Q1U31VI,ATLAS,5,"I bought this phone 3 times in the last 3-ish years. It's a simple, well designed, cheap little phone. As opposed to the flip phones now offered in stores that have 3 letters per key, which is unacceptable for texting, and have a confusing, cumbersome interface. This one has one letter per key and I have had no complaints on it's usability.

Of the 3, one I lost and 2 broke. (so, have a plan for your contacts). but it is that much better than the other non-smart options, so I will keep buying it.

I do miss the camera of smart phones. especially because I have kids. The trade-off is that I am present when I am with my kids. :)

I have the $25/month plan with Cricket!"
B00Q1U31VI,Willow512,5,"This phone is working well for my 9th grader. Even though it is marketed as a prepaid phone, I was able to add it to my existing AT&T plan as a second line. I like that my child can call or text me as needed since now that he is in high school sometimes his after school plans change and he needs a ride at a different time. However I did not want him to have a full featured smart phone that would allow unlimited access to internet browsing and downloading apps, as we restrict his usage to certain times and content. While this phone does have a web browser as a feature, the screen size and usability are such that he is not interested in using it. He also can't download apps we'd rather he not be involved with (Snapchat etc.). Imo this is a great phone option if you are strict in your family about internet usage but you need to provide your child a way to call & text. And finally, at this price point it's not that painful to replace if it gets lost or broken.

UPDATE: This phone is still working out great for us. It was lost about halfway through the school year and we replaced it with the same model. I also stuck a Tile Mate on the back of it which has helped a LOT with keeping track of where it is. Granted the Tile costs almost as much as the phone but it is well worth it in the daily ""where's my phone"" aggravation it saves. I've attached some pictures of the phone with the Tile. My son didn't like the ""bump"" in the profile much at first, but then he really liked how easy it is to find."
B00Q1U31VI,Christina Michelle,5,"Got it for my 11 year old. Full keyboard, camera for pictures and video. No option for wifi, but that's okay... we don't want him to have full Internet access yet anyway. Does have ability for data (web, sending pictures) but that comes through your carrier."
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,4,"Great upgrade to Z431! I don't remember why I didn't buy this phone when I initially dumbgraded from my Android phone, but the extra speed and fewer glitches make this phone a much better choice. The only unfortunate defect is that the power button instantly unlocks the phone, like a screen door on a submarine! Haven't butt-dialed 911 yet, and hopefully with a case on it the button will get pressed less often. The keyboard feels noticeably better than the older model too. If I drown it in a river like I did my Z431, I'll be getting another one of the same."
B00Q1U31VI,C. Catalina,5,"This phone is great and serves its purpose of texting SMS and MMS and making phone calls. I've yet to figure out how to set up voicemail, and the accompanying guides are no help. As of May 2018 it works on AT&T's network without issue. The AT&T store employees had no idea how to set this up and believed it would no longer work because ""it isn't a flip phone"" like the various Samsung Go Phones still for sale, exhibiting their lack of knowledge of phone basics. You need to keep the microSIM that comes with this so that the AT&T store can scan the SIM and phone to switch from your previous contract phone. Battery life with a few calls and texts a day is still 4-6 days before getting dire.

Of course would still work with Go Phone. Also works with Airvoice wireless.

Will update with durability issues and otherwise if they present."
B00Q1U31VI,Mickey,5,"I got so tired of spending good money on phones that inevitably would suffer software issues or I would accidentally drown them. When my blackberry went loco, I was so frustrated that I refused to spend more then $30 on a new phone! I checked this one out at Walmart (for that price), then ordered it here for half the cost. I use mine for music more than anything, and it works very well for that except it is VERY slow to rewind or fast forward (frustrating for audiobooks.) I don't text, but I do make notes for myself and the qwerty works fine for that. The battery lasts me MOST of the day if I'm using the music function constantly. Otherwise if I just use it to talk, I get a few days out of it. The alarms work very well, and I had no trouble setting up different ring tones and setting pictures for my contacts. One word of warning, though...I could never get it to communicate with my computer without a micro-sd card! I hooked it up and it downloaded some device driver, but it would never do anything else (wouldn't show up to my computer at all.) So I had to buy a micro-sd card for all of my music and my ringtones...but I literally plugged in the card and the phone immediately recognized it. I don't have data, so I don't know if I could have downloaded music or not, but you can't transfer files from your computer to your phone WITHOUT a micro-sd card in the phone. I had an AT&T SIM card, and I plugged it into the phone and was immediately up and running. I highly recommend this phone if you're tired of breaking the bank for new phones all the time!"
B00Q1U31VI,NRM,2,"I bought this to replace a dying iPhone 5 because I wanted smaller size, longer battery life, fewer distractions and convenient texting with my Airvoice account. It should meet my needs but has a few glaring faults and I am planning to get a flip phone or smart phone.

PROS:
Good sound quality
Put in your Airvoice SIM in and it is ready to go - no fussing
A nano-SIM works fine - it wedges in tight enough that I've never had to adjust it
Full keyboard is good - keys are at the minimum useful size and font
I do not waste time on this phone!

CONS:
Latest texts are displayed out of order in conversations! This can be confusing because you can't instantly see whether you replied last or the other party did. Plus, when a text is split into multiples and has long parts they are not completely displayed, so you get odd jumbles of sentence fragments and have to click into them to see what they say.
LOCKING IS IDIOTIC: I sent a bunch of blank or meaningless texts to people because the keys are easily depressed when it's in my front pocket. On the home screen it also accepts any # presses, so eventually it butt dials. Think the solution is to turn on locking? Get ready to butt dial 911. When locked it still allows emergency dialing. Not a problem - what is the chance you will randomly dial 911 or 112? Turns out it's 100% because the only key presses it accepts are 9 (followed by 1 and then 1) or 1 (followed by 1 and 2). So if it's locked in your pocket and eventually accumulates ""soigh9hgh4w5hj463h j kj1ji41"" it will dial 911. (Thanks to this phone I learned that if you hang up on 911 before they answer they will call you back.) I turned locking off - I'd rather look like an idiot to my friends than waste the operator's time.
Battery is mediocre - lasts a few days with an hour or two of talking, even when left at my house and I haven't set up wi-fi.
MVNO use is tricky - apps (e-mail, address book, navigation...) are set up for AT&T so they don't work and cannot be removed. I haven't figured out how to use Airvoice data or wi-fi.
Notable delay in receiving key input - so you need to type slowly or you'll double type because you think it wasn't received.
Not all incoming calls show up on recent calls list.
T9 texting seems slower than just typing it all out. It doesn't even add a space after you choose a word, so you need to switch between the cursor and keyboard too much.
Looks like you need to use an SD card and card reader to transfer files (photos, music) to and from a Mac - it's not set up to communicate through USB.

I want a small Airvoice-compatible phone that I can keep in my pocket, don't need to recharge frequently, is good for texting. This phone is marginal on all those counts, so I need to look for a replacement."
B00Q1U31VI,chrystal,5,Was paying $200 a month on a Verizon smartphone. made a financial decision so I bought this phone and turned off my old smart phone. I now pay $30 a month for unlimited talk and text and just use the old phone on wifi for data. this phone is really lightweight and easy to use. hold a charge for a really long time. good buy
B00Q1U31VI,naturelle,3,"I unlocked this phone to use it with Metro PCS. It allows incoming and outgoing calls on the network. It allows incoming and outgoing text messages. However, all the other features do not work. It does not receive pictures via text. The internet browser does not work. I contacted my provider and At&t. Neither was able to help. It is okay with me though, as I got this as a back up for my teenager when she is grounded from modern technology. I don't want her to be without communication in case of an emergency. I just need her to be grounded from all the perks of a smartphone. She thinks it is torture so mission accomplished. I'm sure all the features will be available to you if you are on the At&t network. The keys on the keypad are very tiny. She and I both have petite hands and it was still a little uncomfortable texting."
B00Q1U31VI,Stuart R. Biggerstaff,3,"This has two real improvements over its predecessor. You can dim the display like a smartphone, and a micro sim can be positioned to work without using an adapter.

Otherwise the previous Z431 has a higher capacity battery and its less glossy keyboard is more readable. But either are a nice alternative to a smartphone--better than earlier similar ones from ZTE as java apps can be installed.

Before I broke down and got a smartphone, I had several phones like this, and the ZTE Txtm8 3g was the best. The Altair and Altair 2 are good successors.

One quibble I have is that the Amazon entry calls it the Altair 2, but I don't see any reference to the AT&T version by that name, just the Cricket version. That led to some confusion where a vendor listed a Cricket Z433 on this ad."
B00Q1U31VI,Book Reviewer,3,"This phone is nice. I like that it is relatively basic but still allows texting, video recording, and photo taking. My only complaint is that the phone doesn't stay charged for very long. I am not very active with the phone. Days go by where I barely make a phone call. Some days I text only 5 times and that shouldn't drain the phone as much as it does."
B00Q1U31VI,Wizard of WID,4,"The Go Phone is now partly superseded in AT&T world. You MUST go to an AT&T retail store to get it activated: they will use a new SIM card, not the one included with the phone. The 10 cents per minute prepaid no longer exists: there is only a 25 cents per minute choice. In our case, it is not a big deal, as my grandson will only use it for carrying when we are out in public together. We paid a full year for $100, which equals $8.33 a month, and we will probably never use enough minutes to spend the money out anyway."
B00Q1U31VI,Christopher K.,5,"Purchased for my father (70 years old) to use on our family plan. Just swapped sim cards and everything was set-up automatically. Works for what he wants, would recommend for someone who does not need the internet and only occasionally texts. Very similar in user-interface/functionality to the original BlackBerry phones. Better value than a Jitterbug."
B00Q1U31VI,Andrew,5,"This is a great phone for a great price. I got this as a work phone, and for calling and texting it works perfectly. As I am sick of being pushed into the overpriced smartphone plans and phones, which are of terrible quality, I will likely move to buy another one of these once my iphones battery calls it quits."
B00Q1U31VI,Michelle,1,I will never buy a ZTE phone again. I had this phone less than 60 days before it started powering down all the time. ZTE doesn't warranty these phones so I guess it's just a big gamble. I just went with LG. Paid a few bucks more but it has a warranty. Buy at your own risk!
B00Q1U31VI,JWilson,5,You cant buy this product in the store anymore! Now ATT is forcing you to have a smart phone. This is perfect for my mother in law who doesnt want to use a smart phone at all. This was a great price for this product as well.
B00Q1U31VI,Brandon P,1,"This phone is unusable. Doing simple functions is very slow and the OS constantly freezes, even during typing. I've owned phones that were purchased 10 years ago that have snappier interfaces than this. Does not even perform adequately as a basic texting device. Keep shopping, this isn't the phone you want."
B00Q1U31VI,Molly,4,"arrived before or within the estimated delivery; came new in box with charger and sim card and just needs an at&t prepaid phone plan to be activated; no actual problems

update : charger quit working after using it less than five times. i had to get a new charger, but the phone does still charge."
B00Q1U31VI,MD,5,"I wanted a phone with a qwerty keyboard that my kid could use to text me short functional messages (""come pick me up"" or ""can I do xyz after school?"") or call in an emergency. I was specifically trying to avoid smart phones, but basic flip phones were not an option because they don't have a keyboard. This was basically the only phone that checked all the boxes. Add a basic airvoicewireless plan, and you're good to go. After a few months, still loving this little phone."
B00Q1U31VI,Taking It Back Home,5,"This is a great phone if you are looking for something simple. I love that this phone does not have Wifi and with ATT you can choose not to have data. This is perfect for anyone who does not want internet on their phone. You can call, text and take photos. It covers all the basics and gets the job done. For those like me who do not wish to have a smart phone this is a great option. I had no problem activating this phone within a few minutes."
B00Q1U31VI,Scarlett_Kat,5,"This is a great starter phone for a youth. Or a great phone for the person who just wants to call and text. I had this phone for many years before upgrading to a smartphone. I ordered this for one of my children so they could have a line of communication, yet if he broke it or lost it, no huge loss. Keys are small, so someone with larger fingers might not like it. It was durable and worked nicely."
B00Q1U31VI,Elevenofus,5,"I have two teen daughters that need to be able to communicate with me (and others) via text or talk but they don't need a smart phone. (They may think otherwise. :) ) Anyway, we had one of these for years and it finally got flaky and we bought two more. They can take pictures too. Not smartphone quality, but hey, when I was a teen I would have loved to be able to take pictures whenever I wanted even if the quality wasn't amazing."
B00Q1U31VI,Gordon Johnson,1,"I like the Blackberry-style keyboard standard phones for texting, so when my Samsung wore out I got this as a replacement. Nothing but trouble from the start: 1) Wouldn't recognize my newly-created ATT account, 2) Had to go to the ATT store to activate, 3) After setting the auto screen-lock for 60 sec, it would not respond to the unlock key press sequence, and finally 4) after 3 weeks of trying to set it up and failing, the vendor ""Speed Guaranteed"" refused to exchange, saying the return/exchange period had expired. My experience with this phone was a waste of time and much frustration."
B00Q1U31VI,Kika,2,"This is a $12 phone. Can't believe I paid $30.00 for it. Cheap. I wanted a sturdy basic phone but this is like a toy. navigation isn't that intuitive at first and I am used to these types of phones.

UPDATE: The audio/sound stopped working. no ringtones, message alert tones or warning sounds. I've only started using it less than two weeks ago. I have a return label printed but I can't be without a phone. Dissapointed. This phone is literally worth about 10 bucks"
B00Q1U31VI,Penelope Pappas,5,Love this phone! Simple and straightforward - got the AT&T plan that for $25.00 every 3 months lets you whittle away at it .25 for a call - and 10 cents per text - it's a perfectly functional phone with a small footprint - a steal for $20.00 - I'd get another one in a heartbeat
B00Q1U31VI,MommaKnows,3,"I don't think my kids need yet ANOTHER way to be connected to the internet, so this phone is the answer. We've gone through a few of these phones though. One just died, another had battery issues. But for a kid who doesn't need a smartphone, it's cheap and they can text on it. Perfect."
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,5,"I used this phone so I could move my 10 cents a minute plan from an old school flip phone to something more modern. Glad to say it worked, I didn't think it would because that plan doesn't allow you to use any internet features. The keyboard is small but you will get used to it quickly, and it has long battery life, I usually go for two and a half days before it needs another charge, sometimes longer. It looks sleek and it gets the job done. Speaker quality is top tier as well. And you can lock the keypad to prevent pocket dialing (which you should do immediately because 911 is in the contacts list!)."
B00Q1U31VI,Beautiful Disaster,2,"The phone has had a lot of glitches since we got it. I sort of expected it though, given how cheap it was. We ended up replacing it with another phone that was only about ten bucks more expensive and that phone has been great. I would suggest this phone for a starter phone for a younger child, rather than some iphone or whatever, but definitely not for a teen or an adult."
B00Q1U31VI,The Jay Family,3,"I have smart phones for my personal use but use this phone as my phone for my business. I had a flip-phone before this one and it was strong and durable ...It just was old and quit working so I had to look for a replacement. I was going to buy the same phone I had before but this one was cheaper so I decided to go with this one instead (yes, I was being cheap lol). I don't do any business by text so the texting pad isn't useful to me. It's not a terrible little phone but the buttons are a bit hesitant when you press them while on the phone (like when checking voicemail, etc). The buttons and numbers are also super tiny. Took me a little while to get used to it.

All in all, again, it's not a terrible phone
It does what it's supposed to, no problems with it ...I would just much rather prefer the flip-phone."
B00Q1U31VI,Marsha L. Morris,5,great for my mother in law just learning to use a smart phone and learning how to text. I had one in the past and it was great!
B00Q1U31VI,Kathrine Walker,5,A nice cheap phone for a 9yo without any fancy features.
B00Q1U31VI,JoshinOakland,1,"This phone looked good for our needs, but it failed almost immediately when my daughter finally got around to using it. Battery ran out after 10-15 minutes and needed a recharge, and then failed altogether after very few uses. The seller, Abilee Enterprises, cited the 30-day Amazon return policy when informed that they had sold us a defective product -- fair enough, as we had waiting longer than that to even open the product, but I won't be purchasing anything else from them given that they are sending out broken stuff and taking no responsibility for it. :-("
B00Q1U31VI,JEN CON,5,"BRAND new no issues. I bought this for my daughter for basic talk and text. Definitely cheaper than buying her another phone through the att store. A flip phone was going to cost me $60, all I did was get this one and change out the SIM card with her old one. Works fine, she loves it."
B00Q1U31VI,Karen M. Gill,1,My phone was defective. It wouldn't charge or turn on. I spent an hour on the phone with AT&T. AT&T told me that the number written on the back of this phone was not a valid number and that the phone could not be replaced. Are these phones knock-off with invalid IME numbers? Now I have to purchase a replacement phone with no help from the manufacturer.
B00Q1U31VI,Joseph Miller,1,Button are very small !! They are hard to see and almost impossible to just hit one at a time. I returned item.
B00Q1U31VI,SusieAmazon Customer,5,This phone is fit for a younger crowd. Got it for my daughter that is 11 because she cracked the screen on her other phone and I wasnât ready to spend big bucks on another smart phone. This is a basic phone perfectly fit for a child! Or someone that just wants the super basic cellphone.
B00Q1U31VI,Humbert,5,"It works great with att and anothers att mvno like redpocket mobile and air voice wireless but keep in mind you can only call and text under this mvnos att company because you cannot change APN settings and you will not get able to access internet or web browser however the cell is very good for a basic phone,goog battery life just butons to small so not good for elderly"
B00Q1U31VI,Shan,5,Perfect basic messaging phone without wifi capabilities. Great for a grounded 16yr old boy that needs to communicate with his parents and no one else!
B00Q1U31VI,Leslie Adams,1,"I bought two of these phones brand new and they came with paperwork saying they had a one-year warranty. The ear speaker went after five weeks on one phone. Wrote Blutek Intl who sold it to me - crickets! Never even contacted me. Then I found ZTE website online and emailed back and forth and today was told that this is an ""out of market"" phone and ZTE will not honor the warranty paperwork that is sold with the new phone. They wanted $99.00 to repair the phone - way more than I paid for it. RIP OFF! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AS THE SELLER WILL NOT SUPPORT IT AND THE MANUFACTURER WILL NOT EITHER."
B00Q1U31VI,Imagine Carrie,5,"got this as our home phone (since we aren't about to pay Spectrum for theirs) so the kids have a way to call/text without stealing our expensive phones. simple, easy to use. good for small fingers."
B00Q1U31VI,BIO TREK,5,Works perfect. I use this phone to seamlessly replace my old Z431 AT&T Go Phone. The only thing that was lost is the call log from my old phone.
B00Q1U31VI,M. Collins,3,"This phone comes with no games or anything fancy. It's JUST a basic phone, NOT a smartphone. Exactly what I was looking for.

Update: dropped to a 3 star because the phone is only a year old and has stopped charging. When plugged in it says charging, but had been plugged in for 3 days and the phone won't power on. Not pleased."
B00Q1U31VI,Twin4me,3,"My 10 year old said she wanted a phone...so we got her this. Sound is ok, battery lasts forever...pictures are dismal and she cant figure out how to download games or music, but as a phone its works and the battery lasts forever."
B00Q1U31VI,pegleg,5,"This phone was exactly what I wanted. It is a basic phone with a qwerty keyboard. I didn't need all the bells and whistles of a smart/android phone. I have the $30 monthly plan for unlimited talk and text, no data. But you can get data if you want. Camera works good, just small view."
B00Q1U31VI,Patrick,2,"The keyboard works wonderfully and the screen is big and bright. Those things being established IT'S SUPER SLOW. I know, it's only a $30 dollar phone, but it's like waiting for bad loading screens on a video game. Also, the reception isn't nearly as good as the flip phone this was supposed to replace. I went back to the flip phone."
B00Q1U31VI,CD3748,5,"GREAT price, great phone! I'd been using flip phones, and cheapo phones... and while this phone is thrifty too it looks AMAZING and it works so much better than any other phone in it's price-point. Don't wait, upgrade to this phone. I can't believe I waited, when this was out there."
B00Q1U31VI,Jason,5,"This is great phone, I put my sim card right in and it fired up just like my old one."
B00Q1U31VI,Edward A Logan,5,"A great ""no frills"" phone at this price. Similar to the BlackBerry in its day, but at a much lower cost. Not meant as a substitute for a smart phone, but not every phone I have needs to have those capabilities."
B00Q1U31VI,alan,4,"This is just about the only phone you can get which allows text messaging , but is not a smartphone. I don't use a smartphone but I do text a lot and that is impossible with a flip phone."
B00Q1U31VI,Adam D Hart,2,"I purchased this because I wanted a dumb phone with threaded group texting capability despite being touted as a dumb phone with great texting ability... this does not do that. Other than that, it works fine and the qwerty keyboard is nice."
B00Q1U31VI,Mary,3,This phone was bought for Talk and Text. Has a neat keyboard. The Camera takes Awful pictures and the Video length is very short. My husband is a Shutterbug. Not a good choice for people who like to take photos.
B00Q1U31VI,Robert Newton,5,"Works well for the money. If you want talk and text and use texting quite a bit, it is a good step up from a flip phone. I bought this and went to the AT&T store and they got me hooked up with a good plan that fits this. The other stores could not do as well. I do not regret the purchase."
B00Q1U31VI,L. Galus,5,"No frills. Simple phone that works very well. I had to replace my first phone after being left out in the rain. I bought this model. I had to replace the new phone because my dog ate it. I ordered the same phone because I love it. I actually bought 2 phones because of the sale price. If you don't need bells and whistles, this is a great phone."
B00Q1U31VI,Barb,1,I had the phone set up yesterday and it stopped working n won't comeback on
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,4,is not the best but it works and is quite durable and i like the full keyboard
B00Q1U31VI,Jade S.,5,"I like my phones simple and functional. This is my second one of these, the first ended up being dropped countless times and still work fine and stayed working until I managed to launder it.
This one is great, though more pricey than the first- oh well can't have everything."
B00Q1U31VI,R. Haney,1,Never worked properly. Didn't keep a charge. Constantly dropped calls.
B00Q1U31VI,Damian/Jennifer,5,"Arrived fast, inserted SIM card, and work perfect! Great battery life!!!"
B00Q1U31VI,MaryD,5,"My child keeps breaking his phones so I was looking for an inexpensive replacement phone. This phone has actually lasted the longest. The sound quality is good, the size small and convenient. Great replacement phone for teenager that isn't careful with cell phones."
B00Q1U31VI,Chris,5,"This phone works great! I'm a student in college, and I was getting tired of using a smartphone ineffectively. AKA being distracted. For real, I haven't had a phone like this in almost 10 years, and this is just great! Does all the basics you'd expect a phone to do.
I've had this for almost a month. I switched over from Sprint, and AT&T's customer service was very helpful in getting everything switched. If you're converting from an iPhone, you may need to call customer service, because iMessage gets all weird with your texts, and you will still receive texts on your iPhone. AT&T will do something on the back-end to resolve this.
The pre-loaded wallpaper is eh, but I got a prepaid plan that came w/ 1 gig so you can easily download an image that fits your style.
The texting was strange, but fun to use! It's strange because pushing physical buttons is something I've had to get used to. Another thing about texting is that when you are in a group text, you will not receive the messages in a group. The messages will come in from each individual person in a separate text. I've just let people know that I will reply to them individually from group texts. Another downside to the texting is that you can't see picture texts clearly. The screen is too small to read screenshots people send, but one way to fix this is to save the photo to your phone, and then view it in your pics. Of course that's a pain, but it works most of the time.
Another strange thing I've had to watch out is BUTT DIALING. I've butt dialed/texted people about 3-4 times this month, so you have to be conscious of where you're putting your phone.
Overall, this phone is great. The call quality is GREAT. I've asked my friends if they can hear a difference, and they have all said no.
There aren't any games on this phone (why would you need them anyway?), but it does have useful tools like a calculator, tip calculator, stop watch, notes, and a world clock.
You can have different profile settings, such as silent mode, or low-high volume alerts.
OH, and the battery is GREAT. I can make multiple phone calls, text a lot, and use other things and I go 3 or 4 days in between charges!

Highly recommend this phone if you're tired of being distracted from a smartphone, or you just need a simple phone."
B00Q1U31VI,Yitz,1,Very slow phone.
B00Q1U31VI,Billie,4,Good sturdy cheap first phone for teen.
B00Q1U31VI,Ann,5,"This ZTE Z432 ATT Go Phone is an economical, well-designed little basic phone that works really well."
B00Q1U31VI,WeezyG,5,"The buttons are very small, my husband's fingers are too big to use this phone. But I love it. Makes texting much easier. It's very compact so it fits in my wristlet wallet that I carry."
B00Q1U31VI,Lily,5,bought it for my mom who refuses to get a smart phone. we have cricket but cricket discontinued these phones. All i did was insert my cricket card and started working. Super simple and kept my mom happy.
B00Q1U31VI,Shawn Alan Moline,4,"downgraded from smart phone, this is perfect, durable, easy to type, texting is in conversation threads"
B00Q1U31VI,T. Niqua,5,"wonderful buy! came in two days with prime and had easy set up. inserted sim card in phone and turned on, worked so easily. would recommend to anyone. I used this as a replacement phone that I had a contract with and all I had to do was go to att and get a new sim card."
B00Q1U31VI,D Tash,5,Nice phone to use while traveling. Not expensive and works great.
B00Q1U31VI,Benjamin W Dransfield,3,"Obviously a cheap phone, but was pretty hard to use. Group texting is a real pain on it if not down next to impossible, and I had a bunch of problems with the keyboard keys malfunctioning."
B00Q1U31VI,yehuda zitter,4,"The phone works well, feels fine, and is durable. My only gripe was in the packaging. There is literally nowhere from which to open it. It can't be cut easily, and it is really sharp. Other than that however, this is a solid phone."
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,5,"Exactly what I wanted: a cheap dumb phone with a physical keyboard. My SIM card didn't fit, but I was able to go to the at&t store and have them make me a new one that fit, free of charge."
B00Q1U31VI,Debra Harrell,5,"This phone has been perfect for me. It's been very easy to set up, very easy to use, and I'd buy it again!"
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,5,Looking for a cost efficient replacement for my secondary phone. Does what I need.
B00Q1U31VI,John H. Gallup,5,"This is by-far the best feature phone (non-smart phone) that I have ever used or seen, especially for the price! If you are looking for a low-cost, durable, high-quality phone, and you don't want to spend the money on a smart phone, then this is the phone to purchase."
B00Q1U31VI,Jonathan Strange,5,"Sound is loud enough and very clear, got it for my dad he is hard of hearing and always talks on speaker. He also likes the buttons a lot more then a touch phone. Very easy to use would buy again for him."
B00Q1U31VI,Christopher Howard,1,Donât buy you canât activate the phone the sim is out of date. Youâll need to buy a new one. Then want to charge 50 a month for service. A contract is cheaper.
B00Q1U31VI,Linda R.,3,The key pad was not right for me. Too many letters !!!!! Too small.
B00Q1U31VI,Autumnbinature,5,Perfect for a kids phone.
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,1,Will not stay on. Has full charge. Just wonât work

B00Q1U31VI,Gloria Cardona,3,Works ok
B00Q1U31VI,Veronica Celia Wallace,5,"Great product... Not much to say about it, it's a phone. It functions like a phone, works like a phone, and is a phone. In other words, it was worth my money."
B00Q1U31VI,Shane,2,Its junk
B00Q1U31VI,SWgal,1,Missing charger. Charged with a compatible charger over night and the phone never turned on.

B00Q1U31VI,Jake Mahoney,3,The time on the texts are always messed up... donât get me wrong I love the phone and the format of it all but if there was a fix to the text issue it would bump me up to 4 stars easy:

B00Q1U31VI,Texas Patriot,1,"The protective package was tampered, It was cut open on the bottom and top. The phone was loose in the box out of the protective package without any protection. The SIM chip was missing. I returned the item."

B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,1,Phone was cut open already with the screen cover bubbled up from being removed and replaced. It also had the water sensor triggered inside the battery compartment. There was a white powder substance on the back of the phone and inside the battery compartment. Did I just buy a phone used to traffic drugs? Returning today! I don't need this junk in my house. Deserves a negative star rating!
B00Q1U31VI,tim,1,hard to get it to do what you want

B00Q1U31VI,DS Sebring,4,I didn't want a smart phone. Talk and text only. Works for what I need it for.
B00Q1U31VI,samantha,5,"Definitely nothing fancy, but you can't beat it for the price."
B00Q1U31VI,T. L. Hart,1,"I'm not a major player with phones. I talk on the phone and I text. About once a week I might listen to 30 minutes of music. I got this phone because it looked like it could handle that. I was wrong. I have bought 3 of these in the last 4 months. The first one just completely died in the middle of a phone call. On the second one the ringer quit. Both of these died within the 30 day guarantee period. I bought new ones and shipped the dead ones back. The third one lasted 35 days before the display got scrambled. Since I don't use the display a lot, I kept using it. It died completely on day 39.

Don't get this phone. It is garbage."
B00Q1U31VI,Kimberly Lane,5,"Perfect, thanks"
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,5,"AS DESCRIBED, VERY GOOD!"
B00Q1U31VI,Mary Beth,5,Prompt service. Product brand new in original packing.
B00Q1U31VI,Janelb,4,Not the best phone but it gets the job done. Basic phone for basic calling needs. My only complaints are the battery life sucks on standby and the buttons to dial a phone number are very close together. But after getting used to the qwerty keyboard it fits my basic needs. You certainly can't beat att prepaid plans that's for sure!
B00Q1U31VI,AH,5,Purchased to replace my mothers existing phone on an existing post-paid plan. Swapped the SIM and up and running in 2 minutes. People seem to have unrealistic expectations for a $20 phone. Its works well as a basic phone for talk and text. Don't expect to use it for much else.
B00Q1U31VI,Syble Lee,5,"I really, really liked this phone, but I couldn't keep it because it wouldn't do internet with my service provider. It's a shame too, it was such a perfect phone otherwise!!! Nice and light and had the front buttons without being a blackberry. Oh well all those of you that are using one.......LUCKY!!!!!!!! (In my best Napoleon Dynamite voice)"
B00Q1U31VI,sassy girl,4,"I like my new phone a lot. It is the exact size that I was wanting and the screen is very bright and clear. It also fits in my small crossbody handbag very nicely. However, if I'm not in the right light I have difficulty seeing the numbers."
B00Q1U31VI,Kevin L. Allmer,4,"Wife likes Blackberrys. ""Don't ask me why"". However this Blackberry look alike holds up better than the original Blackberrys."
B00Q1U31VI,Gage,2,"I wanted to use this with US Mobile however it turns out it's basically impossible to unlock. Which means you're paying $25 a month for a plan while competitors would have been like $15 a month for a far better plan. I love it, I just can't use it."
B00Q1U31VI,nathan harris,1,"had an issue with the first phone had to send back for a replacement ( at my cost) second phone worked but the battery was junk, phone quit after one week"
B00Q1U31VI,Anh V. Nguyen,5,"Cons: It lacks wi-fi unlike what some have said. Small buttons and clumsy keypad lock if you don't want any butt dialing. Barely big enough screen.
Pros: It feels sturdy in the hands and has a decent keyboard with satisfying to push buttons. It doesn't require a data plan and texts pretty well. Screen size is adequate, but wish it were larger. It's super affordable.

My parents want a smartphone without a data plan. They have flip phones and ""candy bar"" phones without no keyboard or touch pad. So when I'm in the middle of an assignment, I'm a grad student studying statistics, I have a mini panic attack when they ask me to help them text. Not that it takes long, but it's so gosh darned inconvenient. I'd say some strong four letter expletives, but I'll leave that to imagination.

Packaging was a blisterpack since it's a go phone, but I took the sim card from their old phones and put them into their new phones. Watch out world, my parents can text!"
B00Q1U31VI,jamie claytor,2,"This phone was very slow, and had very little to offer, even for the price..."
B00Q1U31VI,D. Lacoste,5,Great GO phone!
B00Q1U31VI,Jacqueline Jay,3,# too small
B00Q1U31VI,Amy Huebner,1,Speaker on the phone stopped working after 2 weeks. Totally useless now. Bought this for my mom but he didn't get it back to me in time to return it so now I have yet another phone to take in for recycling.
B00Q1U31VI,Shirl,5,good little phone
B00Q1U31VI,MB look,5,Great thanks
B00Q1U31VI,ZMusic,3,"It gets a 3 versus what other phones offer. If you want a phone that has a decent qwerty without many options, this is a good phone for you. For what it offers, it's a 4. The OS is a little slow but works fine. It's a nice alternative for a Blackberry but I only use it for talk and texting. It doesn't compare for e-mail and internet."
B00Q1U31VI,B Newman,4,does what i need it to do
B00Q1U31VI,jpeffley,1,broke within 3 months. Now my son has no way of getting ahold of me until I buy another phone.

B00Q1U31VI,Dot,4,Very good!
B00Q1U31VI,CYB,5,Great phone. Long battery life. Reliable. Sturdy- throw it across a room into a wall and nothing will happen (maybe it'll turn off and the battery will come out... just put it back in and its all good)
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,2,"I would have liked it, as I am wanting to get back to the more simple style of phone after dealing with the headache that are smartphones. However there was no sim card included so I couldn't use . When I called A&T (the worst party) i was transferred 4 times and on the phone for 45 minutes; and they still couldn't send me a sim card because they said they don't have them for this phone. What???? I'll return this one and then buy another one, hopefully it comes with a SIM."
B00Q1U31VI,"CEH, from SW GA",4,"Love it, not a smart phone, but I don's t one a phone smarter than me."

B00Q1U31VI,John,1,"What a rip off...says no plan is needed but guess what you have to have a monthly plan for either $25 or $45 a month I would send this back but you virtually had to use a chainsaw to get it removed from it's package...like the song say's "" I Should Have Known Better """
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,1,"Didn't realize I would not even be able to access my wifi with this phone, let alone Uber"
B00Q1U31VI,D.H.B.,1,I was under the impression that this phone can be used on an existing AT&T plan. NO! It can only be used with a prepaid or specific phone plans for at least 6 months. Check into this before buying the phone.
B00Q1U31VI,donald richard goff,1,Sim card does not fit in this phone.

B00Q1U31VI,Cedar Paonia,2,"This phone is lacking many features including the ability to talk and text at the same time. The photo viewer is really bad, little and blurry. I don't like it at all but I'm stuck with it."
B00Q1U31VI,Byron Walker,3,Okay but it does not have the wifi I needed
B00Q1U31VI,Me,3,"Not much to say about it except it works fine, I have dropped it several times and it hasn't broken yet."
B00Q1U31VI,Kate,2,NOPE!!!
B00Q1U31VI,Unknown,1,If I could give it zero stars I would. Phones received were reported stolen and therefore cannot be used. Att blocks my account every time I make a call.
B00Q1U31VI,JC,2,"dead on arrival. Quick refund, but a waste of time."
B00Q1U31VI,Amazon Customer,4,It's okay was a gift
B00Q1U31VI,Kenn Caesius,3,"What a way to end an era of cellphones â supported for years by heavy SMS and e-mail users, the Z432 is a culmination of those preferences. However demands have changed, at least according to what phone manufactures have said and now this particular phone might well be remembered as the last that will stand out amid the ubiquitous tablet-type phones sold by every major carrier â itâs a sad end for phones with the QWERTY keyboard.

The ZTE Z432 is (perhaps) one of the last of the feature phones with a distinct QWERTY keyboard and applications to use little more beyond the most inexpensive voice-only phones offered to senior citizens. A little bit larger than a credit card and thicker than stack of post-it notes, it prominently features a modified QWERTY keyboard and camera with an image quality of webcam from five years ago. On the software side, It has a messaging application, internet browser, music player, scheduling calendar, and address book. For the sophistication and features, the Z432 rivals, in simplicity, your average discounted flip phones.

Its amazing just how quickly a cellphone can age though. I bought this phone primarily as a replacement my MP3 player and secondary use a phone â a unexpectedly good decision considering the first hand experience I would have with it. Second in cost only to flip phone, the Z432 has since been crippled by AT&T in a tacit planned obsolescence. The installed AT&T e-mail client was discontinued August 2015 rendering unusable to receive and reply to e-mails. On the AT&T support page, they suggest to use the internet browser (Netfront 4.2) but it constantly crashes with trying to load and display any major webpage â when does load a page, its like browsing in Internet Explorer 6. The AT&T Navigator â a GPS-type driving direction application - is not included under any of AT&T prepaid plans and requires an additional $9.99 a month on top of whatever gophone plan you purchase. Even my decision to use it as a MP3 player is questionable â there seems to be no way to synchronize my collection of MP3s and playlists than to do it all on the phone. On the other hand, the phone does have a bluetooth feature to connect my wireless headphones and serves a mediocre player.

There is a reason why you can get this phone so inexpensively â actually I listed more than one reason. While technically outdated in several ways, that simplicity works to the advantage of the phone user needing a no-frills phone â the sound quality is loud and clear, and the QWERTY keyboard is more responsive than any software keyboard. According to the documentation, it has a four and half hour talk time and ten-day standby battery life for the critical moments you cannot have your phone die on you. As an MP3 player, it features what you expect from a generic player with other things like being able to search by typing what you are looking for. This is a is a solid phone - AT&T gophone plans start as little as 25Â¢ a minute for local calls to $60 month unlimited text, voice, and data ensuring that by either text or voice, people can get in contact with you without budget busting contracts."
B00Q1U31VI,John D Ekstromer,1,"Having unfortunately bought 2 ZTE phones, I came to the conclusion ZTEs are the worst phones ever foisted off on the public. They won't hold a charge, despite having a large battery and thus need to be kept on a charger all the time. Their software is so bad, they include a reboot feature when it locks up, as both did. I bought a decent phone, broke both my ZTE's in half, and tossed them in the trash. If I could give a negative 5 stars, I would."
B00Q1U31VI,Grace S.,2,"Ugh. I wanted to love it. I'm downsizing and disconnecting a little because I am a bit too attached to technology and it was causing me some problems. I decided to try this phone but it is going back to the store.

The buttons are incredibly small and the keyboard is over to the left some. I tried transferring some MP3 files via Bluetooth and it took FOR. EHH. VERR. I learned about the butt dialing issue so I activated the key lock and it gave me more grief than it was worth. It is also very slow. I did expect it to be slow, and I know it won't be the same speed as a smart phone or newer device. I totally get that. But STILL. Whenever I would get a text, I'd have to click on the center button, the press the unlock key button, then nothing would be there. A few seconds later, the view message option would finally show up. It was just too clunky. Instead I've taken it waaayyy back and ordered a Motorola Razr from eBay. I was a fast texter on flip phones once, I am sure I can do it again. Besides, I'm old and married with kids and no longer have as many friends as I once did, so no need to text much! ;) I wouldn't recommend this phone."
B00Q1U31VI,ri,3,"You can't transfer photos and videos from phone to pc. Drivers are loaded when initally connecting phone to pc via a usb cable. However, the phone does not show up in windows explorer. I tried loading updated drivers ""join me plus"" but the connection to their servers fail.

Edit: Finally figured out how to transfer photos to pc. Install a microSD card that has to be purchased separately. My phone didn't recognize the card initially even after formatting the card, the phone contacts had to be cleaned with electronic contact cleaner. Only then did the phone recognize the card and allowed photos to be saved to the card. Connect phone to pc via usb cord that has to be purchased separately. The included ""cd drive (E:) Join Me"" software still doesn't work but the card is recognized by windows explorer."
B00Q1U31VI,Cj Sobota,2,"I know this is a cheap phone but I had a cheaper trac phone that worked better. It makes and receives calls, sends and receives texts. The operating system is S L O W !. Just unlocking the screen and getting a message notice can take 10 seconds. That does not sound long until you are staring at the screen waiting, just to get a text. Speaking of screen lock, not so much. You can lock it but having it in your pocket activates keys on a regular basis. Also, this phone has a camera on it but I wouldn't bother trying to use it. No matter how you adjust the options the picture comes out wrong or out of focus. Then the speaker blew. It still makes sound but not clear. Then there is one small complaint about the audio output from the head phone jack. It is good enough for ear buds but WAY too low for plugging into any stereo. Oh, and the phone stopped answering through the headphone jack as well. All of this in less than 1 year of use. But, the battery still lasts for 2 -3 days!"
B00Q1U31VI,Lavo,2,"The phone was okay when I first got it. However, the phone is bad to dial 911 randomly. This is because is preselected to easily dial. That aside, the phone worked good for about a year. Then it started shutting off randomly. Also, then it started not reading the sim card constantly. It would say 'please insert sim card' when the card was already in the phone. I figured out to make it work by putting a piece of paper on top of the sim card when inserting it into the slot. That helps make it work for a while, but you have to keep doing it."
B00Q1U31VI,RunMore,1,"This phone will not work on airvoice wireless for group texting or sending photos (MMS). You cannot receive or send either group texts or photos. I tested this, and confirmed it with airvoice wireless as well. They said you must have a phone which supports internet messaging. Best I can tell, that's pretty much a smartphone and that's it. I wanted a non-smartphone for personal reasons."
B00Q1U31VI,Andrew C.,2,"I have owned two AT&T Go Phones. The first I purchased in March 2015 and the second in April 2016. The first failed as after one year the speaker made everyone whom I spoke with sound like Daffy Duck. I just got rid of the second one as it was starting to happen again. I bit the bullet and finally entered the 21st century and bought my first smart phone, a Samsung Galaxy J3 Eclipse. This paradigm-shift was a big deal for a guy in his mid-60's who was set in his ways with the old technology. Also, this is by no means an aspersion of Daffy Duck, his voice nor Loony Tunes. Thufferin' thasafrath!!"
B00Q1U31VI,Robyn,1,"This phone had problem right out of the box. It displayed the wrong time, and the text capabilities were garbled. I tried to get another phone of a similar make and it had the exact same problems as this one."
B00Q1U31VI,missg,5,"My son loves this phone perfect if you want basic phone. Email, text, internet if needed and calls. Has a radio camera and flash light. Good not to fragile."
B00Q1U31VI,D. Lobley,2,"Before getting this phone, I had a similar-looking one made by Vtech that I had had for two or three years. I liked it until the end, but it started to turn off for no reason and cause me to miss calls and texts, so I decided to get a new phone. I went to an AT&T store and got the phone that looked the most like what I had had. Since it had been a couple years since I got my last phone, I figured any phone I got would be better than the old one.

I was wrong.

This phone struggles to do the most basic of tasks. Every time I answer the phone and say hello, I hear nothing on the other end, because it takes this phone at least a second or two to actually start transmitting my voice. When I get a text and hit a button to activate the screen, I then have to wait a few seconds for the text alert to appear, and then another second or two for it to show the message. The messages don't appear in any kind of order that I can discern. For some people, all their messages to me are lumped together separate from my messages to them; for others they aren't.

I didn't expect this phone to wow me. I expected it to fulfill the most basic requirements of a cell phone with at least something approaching promptness. But it failed to pass even that pretty low bar. So, two stars: one for at least being a phone that does technically receive calls and texts, and not being, say, a sausage, and one for forcing me to learn tai chi and the value of patience every time I user it."
B00Q1U31VI,Mike Johnson,5,... have had this phone for a year now ... and works great ...
B00Q1U31VI,G. Black,2,WARNING NO EMAIL avail on this phone . I had an ALCATEL go phone and it was great. Needed a replacement and got this one. ATT does not provide email to this model phone even if email is part of your plan.
B00Q1U31VI,Diana Kilgore,2,"I really tried to bond with this phone, but after a month I upgraded to a smart phone. The buttons are way too small on this thing making it frustrating to use. For a few dollars more get a ZTE smart phone, it's a much better choice."
